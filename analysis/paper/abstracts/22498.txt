though routine interaction may not have been the case, the fremont were a part of the iconic world of the virgin (anasazi) puebloan people who occupied southeastern nevada north of las vegas in evergreen flats, 75 miles northwest the lower colorado river’s north end bend.   within that region is petroglyph corral visually demonstrating puebloan people at a fremont fringe area where the two cultures may have competed, collided or even collapsed into one another and the more recent numic tribes.   clearly a favored place that inspired recurrent cycles of symbolic affirmation, the contrasting motifs on vertical panels and porphyry slabs at petroglyph corral indicate definite breaks in continuity of heritage and world view over the centuries as rock art accumulated there.  along with the research of excavated archaeological deposits below the panels as a part of the evergreen flat project (horne & musser-lopez 2017), the repatinated art, buried art, faded art, layers of art, obfuscated art and replenished art tell a story of time and change spanning  3000 years from present day numic speakers, back to the puebloan and fremont, with rare traces of hohokam and mojavean, the archaic people who came before.
