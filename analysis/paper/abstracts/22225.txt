located in northwest florida, lake jackson is a fort walton(mississippian) period site with seven mounds, borrow pits, wall-trench architecture, and mortuary objects suggesting interregional interaction. this work examines geospatial relations between artifact distributions, known structural remains, and mound alignments in relation to the landscape. new excavation data from previously unexplored areas and digital presentations of associated artifact densities allows for new views of occupation patterns. these data suggests that the creators of lake jackson developed coordinated alignments of features and continuity in community patterns.
