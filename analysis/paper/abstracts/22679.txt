holly bend, a prolific and successful early 19th century plantation owned by robert davidson in mecklenburg county, north carolina has seen multiple excavations and research over the past several years. in particular, a collection of ceramic tobacco pipe fragments that have been excavated are analyzed to better understand the local smoking culture. several methods are used, including x-ray fluorescence spectrometer analysis to determine local sourcing of the ceramic elements, residue analysis providing plant and material content of the pipe fragments, and a pipe typology identification. residue analysis yields late 18th and early 19th century plant and material species associated with smoking and planation life. pipe typology identification provides the stylistic and economic elements attributed to smoking cultures.
