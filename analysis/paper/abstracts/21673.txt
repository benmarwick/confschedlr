this paper aims to analyze the implementation of integrative project designs developed with local communities in brazil, in a bottom-up strategy. the objective is deliver relevant outcomes and outputs to society incorporating local social values to the process. 

this strategy is also aligned to the development of unesco’s sustainability science goals, from which archeology cannot be isolated. it considers the development of cultural environment projects, where archeology research has more visibility and encourages more participation when integrated into wider scope studies. in such multi-variable projects, archeology is part of a “bigger picture” and is in dialogue with current issues advocating for integrative approach regulations. 

therefore, we must design methodologies and build an agenda, including:

- the development of an applied science, that allies the accomplishment of scientific research with the symmetrical involvement of local communities;

- the intensive use of technology not only to disseminate the research, but especially to increase the involvement of the communities in the construction of knowledge societies. 

this perspective aims to link archeological evidence based on scientific findings to the history and identity of local communities, positioning archeology within the transdisciplinary studies that are necessary to meet the global challenges of the 21st century.
