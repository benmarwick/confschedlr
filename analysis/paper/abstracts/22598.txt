at the ancient purépecha urban center of angamuco in the lake pátzcuaro basin, michoacán, mexico, lidar imaging holds promise for better understanding of monumental architecture at the site scale. the many monumental features at angamuco including mounds, platforms, and pyramids were steeped in symbolic importance and their ubiquity throughout the landscape reflects the strength of the centralized purépecha bureaucratic system. here i examine physical representations of power on the landscape using gis applications to locate monumental structures and analyze their distribution through time and space. i explore themes of urban expansion over the region and decision making involved in the placement of monumental infrastructure. urban growth during the middle postclassic period likely precipitated the construction of monumental structures on a massive scale, however late postclassic architectural forms are also present. current settlement models for the region suggest the most densely populated areas were distributed over eight monumental zones, however spatial relationships between individual monumental structures have yet to be examined.
