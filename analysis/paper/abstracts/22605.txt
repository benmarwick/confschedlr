in the past decades, new theoretical and methodological developments in bioarcheology and archaeology of death have allowed to explore age categories that are very challenging to access archaeologically, as infants and older adults. although mesoamerican archaeology has largely evidence about representations of aging in different sources of information (textual and iconographic) to a broader consideration of funerary practices, approaches of old age as an identity category has been neglected of the archaeological inquiry. this article explores the funerary practices of elderly at monte alban and how it contributes to the understanding about the longevity in the past and the attributions based on age in the context of the organization of the domestic labor in complex societies. aged bodies were selected considering pathologies and markers of senescence that include, for example, joint diseases, osteoporosis, traces of wear and tooth loss (n=40; 12,1%). some symbolical aspects of longevity were introduced in the funerary practices to give meanings to the preservation of the memory of the house. equally, older people are engaged in occupational specializations of the residential group, as ceramic production and trade of prestige goods, throughout the time of occupation of the site.
