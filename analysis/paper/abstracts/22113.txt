archaeologists widely argue that fremont potters from the parowan valley, in southwestern utah, manufactured snake valley pottery. i explore the distribution of fremont snake valley black-on-gray pottery using chemical analyses, metric data, and statistical methods. in my research, i compare neutron activation analysis data from snake valley black-on-gray (svbg) sherds found at archaeological sites within the parowan valley to svbg sherds found at fremont sites over 200 kilometers to the north. through this project i hope to confirm whether the northern sherds were products of potters in the parowan valley, or if these sherds were made elsewhere.
