the aim of the paper is to discuss current possibilities of complex approach to 3d virtual presentation of archaeological information, both to public and professional archaeologists. virtual archaeology including 3d objects, reconstruction of building structures and even past landscape scenes has been for several years a standard and specific way of documentation and interpretation. however, what is currently changing is the general availability of the necessary technologies. a common feature of new software solutions and new technological equipment is their high user-friendliness, which allows high-quality outputs without deeper knowledge of the issue or prior extended training. another new important aspect is the low acquisition price of the software and equipment as compared to the previous period; moreover, many freeware tools have been created. last but not least, there are new platforms for easy presentation and sharing of virtual data. in our talk, we will provide an overview of options for using the new 3d technologies especially for small heritage actors.
