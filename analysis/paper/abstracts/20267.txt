excavation is often the way to mitigate for the loss of cultural resources to comply with section 106 of the national historic preservation act. however, excavation is not always the most practical solution due to high project costs, lack of research potential, or stakeholders like tribal communities not wanting excavation. a case study from los alamos national laboratory (lanl) is used here to demonstrate how alternative forms of mitigation advance the research value of the cultural resources selected for study, grow public awareness and discourse through outreach and education, and increase flexibility in land-use decisions by agencies while satisfying the mutual interests of stakeholders. ancestral puebloan fieldhouses (a.d. 1200-1600) were impacted at lanl, and rather than excavating additional fieldhouses for mitigation, a synthesis of fieldhouse data from the region was requested. the project resulted in the acquisition of new and meaningful research that advances northern new mexico and helps lanl archaeologists determine eligibility recommendations. also, funds went towards the creation of a free public book to achieve wider public awareness about the local archaeology and significance of cultural preservation. i identify lessons learned during this project and offer recommendations for future application of alternative mitigations.
