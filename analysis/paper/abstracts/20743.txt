the intrinsic relationship between human beings and bodies of water is unquestionable. among the ancient maya it has been observed that many of their agricultural cults were linked to existing bodies of water where they settled.  in the maya northern lowlands, multiple underwater archaeological studies of cenotes record this behavior as offerings of luxury items and human sacrifice are often recovered and noted.  the rancho ojo de agua archaeological project focuses on the basin of the lacanhá river.  in the preliminary year of study, ethnographic evidence suggests that on may 3 every year, the current indigenous maya groups of the region conduct pilgrimages to neighboring bodies of water to assure assistance for a prosperous agriculture season. underwater archaeological surveys including dive-line and circular survey of three lagoons, sanctuary of the crocodiles, laguna ramón cruz and laguna sibal,  in the basin of lacanha river in the maya southern lowands were conducted by the rancho ojo de agua archaeological project to understand the relationship of these bodies of water to early maya settlement.   the initial discoveries made in three bodies of water will be presented.
