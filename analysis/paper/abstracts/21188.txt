official discourses of what is considered cultural heritage affect the preservation and management of archaeological sites, as well as how people perceive and understand their cultural heritage. consequently, the manner in which sites are managed impacts the degree of participation that people can have in their preservation, an activity that may serve in shaping local identities. the archaeological site of los indios in santa isabel, puerto rico, is an undervalued archaeological resource whose resident community cares for its preservation. however, they feel that it is hardly possible due to the lack of the government’s interest, which has led many times to the destruction of sites. on the other hand, the regard of the historical site of old san juan as cultural heritage is rarely questioned given that residents have to follow rigorous rules imposed by the local and federal government for the preservation of the historical architecture. in this presentation, i explore the impact that cultural heritage discourses have had in the preservation of puerto rico’s archaeological resources, through the comparison and analysis of: cases of archaeological scandals in the puerto rican media, and cultural heritage discourses of government institutions, archaeologists and residents of santa isabel and old san juan.
