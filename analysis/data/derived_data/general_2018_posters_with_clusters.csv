Researchers used portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) technology to sample the elemental content of over 500 round balls from more than 17 different archaeological sites in eastern North America. These include samples from Native American and Euro-American settlements as well as French and Indian War, Revolutionary War, Indian Wars and War of 1812 sites. These preliminary data demonstrate that Antimony (Sb) and Tin (Sn) are very important elements for measuring differences in round balls. One goal is to elevate the diagnostic value of round ball ammunition so that we can determine where the lead came from, who was firing the bullets, and how did access to lead vary over time. The pXRF information shows promise in identifying additives or contaminants introduced and military association. If combined with element data from lead ore sources, baseline information can be developed for comparison among battlefield assemblages and incorporated into a global dataset with the purpose of better understanding the geographic distribution of military supplies and military strategy at macro global and regional levels.","north_america_southeast_united_states","historic","archaeometry__materials_analysis_xrf_pxrf","historical_archaeology","north_america_southeast_united_states historic archaeometry__materials_analysis_xrf_pxrf historical_archaeology",2

","Neolithic","Digital Archaeology","Environment and Climate ",TRUE,TRUE,"During the early and middle Holocene, the introduction of agropastoral subsistence to Europe resulted in significant social and economic transformations. For decades, researchers have recognized that early agricultural communities had an ecological impact on the surrounding landscapes. As a whole, paleoecological records indicate increases in charcoal abundance and changes in vegetation communities’ distribution or diversity related to Neolithic agricultural land clearing, burning, or pastoral activities. Yet, most research on the paleoenvironmental impact of Neolithic agropastoral systems have been limited to site-based or regional analyses—without a broader discussion of the ecological impact of Neolithic land-use across multiple ecoregions. 
 This study attempts to better understand the spread of Neolithic subsistence across Europe by contrasting the chronological and spatial patterning of the spread of agriculture with the palynology of Europe during this period. We utilize a database of over 5,000 radiocarbon dates from Neolithic contexts through Europe and a comprehensive pollen dataset adapted from the European Pollen Database. From these data, we construct and statistically compare chronosurfaces of Neolithic occupation and major vegetation transformations to track the pace and intensity of ecological change in Europe due to the initial shift to agropastoral land-use.

These studies indicated that residents consumed large quantities of shellfish and marine fish during both the Formative and Regional Development periods (2800 BC – 700 AD), with a marked decrease and differential access based on socioeconomic status in the later period. It has been hypothesized that site residents increased their reliance on domesticated plant foods, especially maize, in order to compensate for decreased consumption of marine foods. While no physical evidence for maize has been found, there exists a chance for bias based on poor preservation and sampling. 

In order to better address dietary practices at the site and test the maize hypothesis, stable isotope and elemental analysis of 16 elite and non-elite individuals from the Regional Development period were conducted. Bone collagen carbon and nitrogen, and bone apatite and tooth enamel carbon and oxygen isotope ratios were determined, along with calcium, strontium, and barium elemental values.The isotopic results reinforce previous conclusions concerning diet at El Dornajo, including the lack of evidence for maize. We, therefore, conclude that any increased reliance on plant foods focused on other indigenous plant resources.

Despite its importance fuel use in the Arctic and Subarctic has received relatively little attention. Work currently underway aims to clarify the criteria used to select fuel in ancient Alaska by testing two hypotheses. The Efficiency Maximization hypothesis, derived from the prey choice model of human behavioral ecology, proposes that Alaskans ranked woody taxa according to net energy acquisition, and preferentially selected highly ranked taxa. The Firewood Indifference hypothesis proposes that Alaskans were not selective but rather sought to minimize the energy and time expended gathering firewood without regard for the specific properties of different taxa. This pattern is predicted by the prevailing fuel use model, the “Principle of Least Effort” (PLE), but is at odds with ethnography, which indicates that Native Alaskans discriminate between and seek specific wood(s) with preferred properties. 
 This paper reports the results of preliminary statistical analyses designed to determine which fuel-use model best explains the anthracological record for three Alaskan sites. These sites differ in cultural affiliation, ecological setting, and chronological position, and thus illustrate how different constraining variables determined fuel selection strategies.","north_america_arctic_subarctic","arctic","paleoethnobotany","human_behavioral_ecology","north_america_arctic_subarctic arctic paleoethnobotany human_behavioral_ecology",12

We believe the answer to this question lies in their function. 
Despite their importance these artefacts have never been thoroughly investigated and mention of them is mostly absent in the literature. Exceptionally well-preserved organic residues found on the surfaces of stone bowls and griddle stones offer the opportunity to investigate function through molecular and chemical analysis. Using GC-MS and GC-c-IRMS we identified organic residue origins and were able to carefully suggest function for both artefact groups. Additionally we explored environmental change in the light of artefact function as a factor in the sudden change of stone bowl occurrence during the Margaret Bay phase (4.000-3.000 cal BP) on Unalaska Island.

The late antiquity sites are more consistent with a C3 plant diet with some marine and terrestrial animal contributions, while the Langobard sites are varied. This study shows that in late antiquity people in the Veneto still relied on a traditional Roman diet of fish and C3 resources after the fall of the Western Roman Empire; however, the incoming Langobards show variation in their utilization of resources, with some consuming more of a C4 diet with millet.

How and why earthwork construction moved from small to massive are enduring questions yet to be solved. Recent magnetic survey in southern Ohio at two sites of moderate size, Junction Group (33Ro28) and Steel Earthworks (33Ro62), provides mounting evidence for an intermediate level of size and complexity. Both sites contain a range of geometric shapes, including some that are unique. Enclosures are clustered in their spacing and orientation, suggesting growth through time. And at least three kinds of architecture were in use: traditional ditch-and-embankment enclosures of varying size, small enclosures demarcated by narrow trenches (perhaps without embankments), and circles of posts lacking ditches or embankments. Earthwork sites of intermediate size provide a link in time, complexity, and perhaps space between the small sites of the Early Woodland and the immense complexes of the Middle Woodland. They also signal a change in the organization of people and activities on the landscape.","north_america_midwest","woodland","remote_sensing_geophysics","monumentality","north_america_midwest woodland remote_sensing_geophysics monumentality",16

A recent survey conducted in 2014 and 2015 identified several relic beach features at varying elevations above the current water line of Knife Lake. GIS was used to model and predict these proglacial lake shoreline features to better understand the procurement patterns of Knife Lake siltstone, a prominent lithic material in Minnesota. It is believed that these beachlines were formed by successive phases of a proglacial lake and may relate to an eastern extension of glacial Lake Agassiz during the Late Paleoindian period when several of the Knife Lake quarries were active.
 Using the elevation of relic beach features identified by survey, several different inundation maps were made using GIS to visualize the Knife Lake area during each of the different phases of the hypothesized proglacial lake.  The maps were made using LiDAR data freely available from the Minnesota Geospatial office. These maps are being used to help archaeologists better understand the potential distribution of archaeological sites on relic beaches at an unexpected distance from the present extent of Knife Lake.

Others, instead, describe the upland populations as independent communities with rich histories of their own. Still others speculate about the extent to which different parts of the region were connected. As a contribution to this debate, we have used electron microprobe assays of phyllite-tempered ceramics to trace the movement of pots across the uplands and thereby demarcate networks of interaction among neighboring settlements. Several pertinent results have emerged. First, two disconnected spheres of interaction divided the upland region. One sphere included close connections with the Hohokam to the south; the other did not. One sphere engaged the populations on Perry Mesa to the north; the other did not. Second, Hohokam farmers probably imported seasonal agricultural labor from one part of the upland zone. Third, an integrated community along Cave Creek shared the same pottery until the area became an abandoned frontier, where unaffiliated farmsteads moved in without exchanging pottery with one another.","north_america_southwest_united_states","hohokam","archaeometry__materials_analysis","network_analysis","north_america_southwest_united_states hohokam archaeometry__materials_analysis network_analysis",1

Here, however, I move away from the traditional chronological approach, in order to examine the iconographic data present in the form of representation itself, the so-called palimpsest. The way that meaning develops though the act of layering itself is a process by which the icons interact and modify one another. Such an approach reveals not only the rich, information-laden periods between discrete chronological chapters but also demonstrates that palimpsests are far more than the sum of their parts.","north_america_southwest_united_states","ancestral_pueblo","survey","iconography_art_rock_art","north_america_southwest_united_states ancestral_pueblo survey iconography_art_rock_art",20

The process of building a 3D model based upon partial excavation and comparative research is described, and the outcomes of the study in terms of enhancing learning and hypothesis construction are reviewed.  Presentation of resulting models produced in the digital software program Blender are then juxtaposed to traditional archaeological illustration and the benefits and drawbacks of employing each method for this purpose are discussed.","north_america_southwest_united_states","ancestral_pueblo","digital_archaeology_3d_modeling","architecture","north_america_southwest_united_states ancestral_pueblo digital_archaeology_3d_modeling architecture",23

Systematic survey and mapping, which included the recording of surface artifacts at 43 locations across the site, revealed two areas of concentrated architecture, one area of tombs, abundant ceramic sherds, groundstone tools, and evidence of metal production. Based on survey data and the artifacts housed in the museum, the site appears to have been occupied from the Intermediate onward to the Late Horizon Period, roughly coinciding with the end of Tiwanakan influence, subsequent occupation by warring polities in the Late Intermediate Period, and finally the invasion of the Inca as they established the southern extent of their empire. Artifactual and architectural data provide a basis to interpret the function of the site as a frontier of the Incan Empire, develop research questions for future investigations at the site, and contribute to the sparse amount of archaeological information concerning this area of the world.

","Neolithic","Ceramic Analysis","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers",TRUE,TRUE,"Archaeologists suggest that during the transitions between the Pleistocene and the Holocene, drastic changes occurred in the lifeways of humanity. They are termed the “Neolithization processes.” Changes include the advent of food production and sedentism, and the adoption of pottery and ground stones. However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes. Our results add new understanding to our previous results on the timings of technological, behavioral, and paleoenvironmental changes.

Despite the inherent hazard, people have occupied this region since the Paleo-Indian period (7000 B.C.). Numerous studies have explored volcanic eruptions as forcing mechanism that lead to culture; however, starting with the advent of sedentary villages during the Tronodora phase (2000-500 B.C.) until the arrival of Spanish in the 16th century, people maintained relatively small-scale, semi-horticultural societies. To explore the adaptability of the pre-historic peoples of this region, this research aims to address innovative ways people respond, recover, and mitigate disaster by dynamically modeling risk using GIS. This is important for the Tilarán -Arenal region as this is an area with variable topographic terrain and microclimates. The repeated volcanic eruptions were not uniform events with clearly demarcated boundaries but rather would have had diverse impacts even within relatively small geographic areas. In applying this methodology to the Tilarán-Arenal region, this research aims to expand beyond the pervasive holistic effects scenario that pervades disaster research.

The study focuses on two distinct weapons frequently observed in the Chankan archaeological record: the star mace and the circular mace.  The weapons were reconstructed in accurate weight and form from casts of authentic artifacts and will strike 10mm-thick casts of dental plaster, which mimic the frontal bone—a probable surface for impact damage in hand-to-hand combat. To achieve an accurate result, the experiment will consist of no less than 100 trials. Preliminary assessment suggests the star mace will result in the most fractures due to its several points, rolling across the frontal bone to create multiple areas of impact damage; however, the greater weight of the circular mace is expected to result in wounds of greater depth.

Combining these health indicators with other socioeconomic factors can be informative about the social status of individuals and allow both a correlation of infection rates among suspected elite versus non-elite individuals, as well as make a socioeconomic versus health status comparison between two villages within the region coexisting within the same period. Results may aid future inquiry into non-specific infection rates among the pre-classic Maya of the lowlands, and provide an overall picture of health within a framework of social conditions during this pivotal time-period in Maya development. Furthermore, if infection rates are similar between K’axob and Cuello, this information could be used to make inferences about other similar Maya groups during the pre-classic.","mesoamerica_maya_lowlands","maya_preclassic","bioarchaeology_skeletal_analysis","mortuary_archaeology","mesoamerica_maya_lowlands maya_preclassic bioarchaeology_skeletal_analysis mortuary_archaeology",34

Eolian soils are not always conducive to dry-farmed agriculture; however, dune farming is known ethnographically, and has been inferred in archaeological contexts on the southern Colorado Plateau. Previous work by the author has demonstrated that eolian soils in the Petrified Forest National Park are high in clay, which may have increased the water holding capacity of the soils, improving their suitability for farming. This study uses soil chemistry to further test the suitability of eolian sediments for prehistoric cultivation in the region.

The domestic guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) was introduced to the Caribbean post-AD500 through human transportation. Archaeological remains of guinea pigs are present on several Caribbean islands. This study used complete mitogenomes from ancient guinea pigs as a commensal model to identify likely human migration routes and interaction spheres within the Caribbean region. Possible origins of early historic European and North American guinea pigs were also determined. Complete mitogenomes of 23 ancient and two modern guinea pigs were obtained. The identified haplogroups indicate that two introductions of guinea pigs to the Caribbean likely occurred, both from Peru, to Puerto Rico (AD500) and the Lesser Antilles (AD1000). A potential origin for historic European domestic guinea pigs was identified as the Andean region encompassing Peru and Bolivia. A historic period North American guinea pig was found to have likely come from Peru. This study is the first to use next-generation sequencing to obtain complete mitogenomes of a commensal animal to investigate prehistoric interaction in the pan-Caribbean region, and results are in agreement with current archaeological evidence for human mobility and interaction in the Caribbean.

Scattered through parts of northeastern and north-central Kansas are prehistoric burial sites in the form of low rock and earthen mounds located atop bluffs overlooking stream valleys. In Kansas, the Unmarked Burial Sites Preservation Act exists to protect these sites, but this law is only effective if the location of these features is known. Most prehistoric mounds in this region are subtle in appearance, making them difficult to recognize. If sites are not recorded and protected, they may be unintentionally or intentionally destroyed. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software and the Kanas State Historical Society Archaeological Site Inventory, a map was created pinpointing the locations of recorded burial mounds in Clay, Geary, Pottawatomie, Riley, and Wabaunsee counties. Geographic associations of known mounds relative to topographic and hydrologic features were highlighted in order to recognize spatial patterns and simple statistical procedures were used to predict areas with high potential for past use as prehistoric burial sites. Samples of these areas were targeted for pedestrian survey to identify and record additional burial mound features with the overall goal of helping protect prehistoric burial sites in northeastern Kansas. Four burial mound sites were recorded because of these surveys.

In Bioanthropology, migration is often perceived in oversimplified terms. Researchers seek to determine if an individual or group migrated, and when in their lifetime this occurred. Furthermore, many scholars treat diversity in equally simplified terms. Traditionally, individuals are assigned to an ancestral population of “best fit,” despite claims that this practice is unreliable. Migration and diversity are complex, intertwined elements of the human experience and must be approached in tandem using multidisciplinary methods.   
This poster outlines the methods available to examine past migration and identifies ways to incorporate them with evidence of diversity. Scientific approaches, i.e. biodistance and isotopic analyses, will be combined with cultural approaches, i.e. the study of material goods and funerary accounts of diversity, and literary approaches, which document native Roman and migrant opinions. These methods will be applied to case studies from imperial Rome, which was characterized by diverse communities as a result of frequent conquest and large-scale population movements. The outcome will establish if this integrated approach allows for greater insight into the experiences of migrating and host communities.","europe","","bioarchaeology_skeletal_analysis","migration","europe  bioarchaeology_skeletal_analysis migration",7

Magnetic gradiometry was conducted at three sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Iroquoian villages in Ontario, Canada: Spang, Trent-Foster, and Hamilton-Lougheed. A search of extant excavation records was conducted to characterize the range of architectural variability likely to be found on these sites, including structure dimensions, hearth placement, and wall construction techniques. The different kinds of anomalies that these structural variations might present in magnetic gradiometry data were reproduced, and compared to actual data collected from the three sites. Based on these expectations and the identified anomalies, significant intersite and intrasite architectural variability is inferred.

Poster Abstract

Pottery manufacturing in Early Bronze Age (EBA) Anatolia witnessed a host of technical innovations that transformed what had been a small-scale domestic activity into a specialist craft. At the proto-urban village of Seyitömer Höyük, dedicated pottery workshops appeared in the EBIII period (ca. 2250-2200 BCE), along with a suite of technical innovations, such as pottery molds, clay mixing pits, and clusters of pottery kilns. These advances allowed potters to manufacture more vessels with less effort, and represent a fundamental shift in the chaine operatoire, which is indicative of broader social and economic changes in the EBA. This poster presents the archaeological evidence for various stages of standardized pottery production, in comic book style. Sequential illustrations tell the story of an apprentice potter learning her craft under the tutelage of a seasoned corporate group of specialists. These fictional characters perform activities that are empirically attested at Seyitömer Höyük, and offer an approachable way for general audiences to engage with real archaeological data.

The data additionally suggest that the Inka incorporation of the Chincha kingdom into the Inka empire was not as peaceful as previously thought, as evidenced by the construction of defensive walls in various areas of the site.

","Maya: Preclassic","Remote Sensing/Geophysics","Landscape Archaeology",FALSE,TRUE,"It is well established that the ancient Maya favored certain orientations for the buildings in their major urban centers. In the southern Maya lowlands, an orientation of 14° clockwise from the cardinal directions is particularly common. How did the ancient Maya find this orientation? What was their surveying technique? Lidar from many sites shows that this orientation was not limited to major constructions. The smallest residential structures and patio groups, structures spread throughout the site, also were orientated to specific directions. The method of orientation had to be relatively simple, accessible to all levels of society, workable on all parts of the landscape (not just where the horizon is visible), and, most likely, usable at any time of year (e.g., not just at solstice or equinox). A first step in orientating a construction to a particular direction would be to establish the cardinal directions (separately, constructions also could be orientated to features on the horizon). Two methods to determine the cardinal directions are presented here: the north method and the Gnomon E-W method. With the current lack of knowledge of ancient Maya astronomical instruments, examples from other ancient cultures are considered.","central_america_northern_south_america","maya_preclassic","remote_sensing_geophysics","landscape_archaeology","central_america_northern_south_america maya_preclassic remote_sensing_geophysics landscape_archaeology",29

The machete is widely used across Central and South America for agricultural purposes and is intermittently documented in violent events. This study aimed to contextualize multiple documented machete attacks across Mexico using geospatial software. Documentation from academic, ethnographic, and news syndicates from a four-year period were used as primary sources to analyze attacks within geospatial software. Attacks were subsequently analyzed utilizing multiple spatial toolkits. ArcGIS, the geospatial software employed, allowed for query of proximity to public health care and examination of frequency of attacks in relation to known population data. Study results suggest geospatial approaches are useful for analysis of violent attacks. ArcGIS-based approaches present an opportunity to contextualize violent attacks according to unique socio-cultural and economic factors, which prevents overgeneralizations of data sets. Factors such as age, gender, health status of individuals, and element(s) attacked (e.g., arm or hand) were manually inputted and used in subsequent queries. Results found that machete attacks were more frequently concentrated in rural populations, which often lacked sufficient medical care to treat severe trauma. This study argues that GIS-based approaches are potentially useful for multiple subfields of anthropology and may be used in ancient and contemporary analyses.

We demonstrate the utilitarian use of these quartzite tools through microwear and experimental analysis in conjunction with archaeological and ethnographic contexts. We suggest the daily practice of using these tools at Slocan Narrows linked inhabitants at the site to prominent fishing grounds at Kettle Falls that had social, economic, and ritual significance. This highlights the importance lithic raw materials can have in conveying social information and connecting people to landscapes.

Two cases studies are presented to illustrate how this framework which hybridizes elements of landscape and migration archaeology can be used to suggest maritime migration routes. The resulting movement paths were systemically analyzed and locations with high probabilities of use as movement corridors and stopping points were identified. This work is some of the first to apply LCP to seascapes and marine migration in North America and the results have the potential to lead to a better under- standing of migration during the Late Pleistocene.

A shift to smaller individuals without a change in oyster growth rate was documented from the Late Archaic into the Caloosahatchee when Calusa population size increased considerably in the region. Modern oyster populations exhibit a return to Late Archaic size, suggesting that the Calusa did not impose a permanent genetic change on oyster capacity for growth. These patterns were displayed for two estuaries in Southwest Florida: Estero Bay and Pine Island Sound. New data from recent excavations from Mound Key, Estero Bay, further support these interpretations. 35 samples spanning ~ AD 1000–AD 1400 all exhibit similar small sizes consistent with the Late Caloosahatchee period across the broader region. Additionally, taphonomic grading (sensu Savarese et al., 2016) also demonstrates that Mound Key’s midden oysters were harvested for consumption, rather than mined strictly as building material.

As pointed out by several authors, the perception of change, understanding within specific cultural framework(s), and reactions to those changes, are crucial elements in the understanding of human-climate relationship. It is in this context that the so-called Holocene Rapid Climatic Changes (RCCs) – must be understood. 
Among the various RCCs, the so-called 4.2k event represents a special case-study – being often associated with hypothetical widespread changes in the archaeological record. Together with a fresh look at the 4.2k climatic event, we analyze and discuss the ways in which those ‘climatic narratives’ have been built by comparing the Near and Far Eastern cases. Through it we show that mismatches of scale, archaeological and climatic, have profound impact on the way we reconstruct the past.","asia","bronze_age","","environment_climate","asia bronze_age  environment_climate",11

In contrast to the preceding periods, in which mixed agro-pastoral groups appear to have dominated highland Peru, many LIP populations seem to have adopted increasingly specialized pastoral or agricultural strategies. This increased economic specialization would likely have fostered inter-group cooperation, as subsistence generally required the products of both herding and agriculture. In tandem with this, the LIP also saw the development of new forms and scales of ritual, as groups sought to extend their geographic reach and influence. 

Drawing on excavation data and analysis of micromorphological samples from Sangayaico, in the Upper Ica drainage of the south-central Peruvian Andes, we examine how one LIP community established and maintained bonds of cooperation in a time of major political and economic transitions. Initial excavation data – such as the plaza dated to the LIP – suggests that ritual activity at Sangayaico increased in scale and intensity during this period. Micromorphological analysis of these ritual contexts has helped to illuminate how these features were constructed and used, thus furthering our understanding of how communities used ritual to mediate community relations.

From their piedmont location, residents of Izapa would have had access to plant resources from a wide variety of environmental zones, including the coastal plain, estuaries, mangrove swamps, and the beach. This study applies starch grain analysis, a microbotanical technique, to ceramics and ground stone pieces recovered from domestic ritual and refuse deposits at the Formative period capital of Izapa.

Thus, we can expect that many technological traits of vessels such as temper, wall thickness, porosity, firing temperature, and manufacturing techniques will be systematically shaped by local performance conditions. One key dimension of variability that is directly associated with the performance of vessels to cook food is thermal conductivity: the rate at which heat is transferred from one side of the vessel wall to the other. The physical properties of ceramic vessels are key to understanding how an object insulates, conducts, or withstands temperature change.

The Calusa thrived in this bay, partially due to the natural resources available, including these oyster reefs. Sediment cores from this region show a rich history of reef development dating to ~2200 yBP. The reefs exhibit an ecological succession shifting from a vermetiform gastropod community to oysters ~600 yBP, a time when Calusa exploitation of oysters began at Mound Key. Reef history varies between the northern and southern regions of Horseshoe Keys. Northern reefs developed upon mangrove peats and began their history with a rich molluscan fauna indicative of a higher, near marine salinity. Alternatively, the southern reefs developed upon a graminoid marsh with subsequent bay and reef faunas dominated by brackish mollusks. These differences suggest that the Estero River was a formidable freshwater source near Mound Key with more marine conditions located short distances away within the reef tract. Studying these gradients from the geological perspective combined with findings from the archaeology of Mound Key allows for a holistic understanding of environmental change and resource utilization by the Calusa.","north_america_southeast_united_states","woodland","geoarchaeology","","north_america_southeast_united_states woodland geoarchaeology",38

Our goals are twofold. First, we examine microartifacts from four different feature morphologies (which vary in shape and size) to see if the micro debris reflects differences in what was cooked and/or how foods were cooked over time. We then integrate the microartifact data with previously published faunal and experimental results. Second, we advocate for taking a more robust approach to microartifact data analyses to include ubiquity and diversity measures in addition to the more commonly used density measures of comparison. Preliminary results suggest that while some features were multipurpose in function, others were more specialized for processing particular kinds of foods using cooking methods ranging from broiling, to steaming, to parching.

As early inhabitants of Europe moved across the landscape they came into contact with others and left behind material traces of these interactions. Whether these artifacts came to be deposited through processes of migration or exchange, marine shells are particularly useful for exploring these processes, as their presence far from the sea can be indicative of dynamic interactions between materials, individuals, and groups.
Through the use of social network analysis software called Gephi, this research visually maps the interactions between sites and regions based on the genera of marine shells present. By creating network visualizations that are analyzed mathematically, in addition to geographic maps of site locations, patterns in the interactions within which materials and people were embedded and entangled are explored.

","Paleolithic","Lithic Analysis","Education/Pedagogy",TRUE,TRUE,"Flintknappers during the Levantine Epipaleolithic were proficient at microlith production, these skills were learned and passed down from one flintknapping generation to another as no one is born with the innate ability to flintknap. By utilizing practice theory and a chaîne opératoire approach to the Epipaleolithic chipped stone tool reduction sequences of narrow-nosed cores at Kharaneh IV, I strive to identify how individuals learned to flintknap, from raw material acquisition to the production of the final tool. I view the knowledge transmission process as a proxy for culture: as apprentices took on new ideas and identities to fit within a community of practice, the apprentice may have lost (or maintained) kinship ties yet subscribed to a more meaningful relationship within their community of practice. Kharaneh IV is an Early and Middle Epipaleolithic aggregation site well-situated for this research due to its well-preserved stratigraphy, numerous caches, and hut structures, which allows for observation of repetitive practices and identification of changes in technique. Research is currently in the nascent stages of core refitting: future experimental work is planned to establish baseline knowledge regarding the relationship between skill level and social structures that influence the production process.","asia_southwest_asia_levant","paleolithic","lithic_analysis","education_pedagogy","asia_southwest_asia_levant paleolithic lithic_analysis education_pedagogy",40

Over the course of the Late and Terminal Preclassic periods (ca. 350BC-AD200), as Ceibal grew into an urban center, minor temples were built at regular intervals around the site core. These temples were the centers of local communities that were integrated primarily through ritual practices. Many temple groups are associated with reservoirs or other sources of water. As many scholars have noted, reservoirs would have been important locations for day-to-day interactions, and crucial to supporting local populations. In this way, water management was also central to local community formation and organization. This study examines water management at the community level by focusing on 1) excavation data and field observations of five reservoirs; 2) geospatial analyses that explore the distribution of reservoirs in relation to residential zoning patterns around minor temples; and 3) analysis of pollen in soils collected from the reservoirs. Overall, this research suggests that water catchments were managed at the household and local community level, and supports decentralized models of social and political organization in ancient Maya society.","mesoamerica_maya_lowlands","maya_preclassic","digital_archaeology_gis","settlement_patterns","mesoamerica_maya_lowlands maya_preclassic digital_archaeology_gis settlement_patterns",25

Forensic archaeologists’ extensive knowledge of postmortem taphonomic effects on material objects has led to more precise interpretations of postmortem interval, environmental (including scavenger-induced) scattering and alteration of human remains, and site formation processes. Experimental taphonomic research has formed the core of these advances in site interpretation, particularly through its focus on differentiating perimortem (at or around the time of death) from postmortem events. This concept is illustrated through RU Forensic Science Institute (RUFSI) research aimed at differentiating perimortem bone fracture from postmortem breakage. A sample of 300 Sus scrofa ribs underwent controlled Blunt Force Trauma in the RUFSI at known periodic perimortem and postmortem intervals, ranging from 0 to 112 days of environmental exposure. Resulting rib fractures were analyzed macroscopically and microscopically to define signature fracture morphology across time periods. These results allow differentiation of perimortem fracture versus postmortem breakage and inform period of exposure and contextual history of field remains. Forensic archaeology research can therefore play an integral role in interpretations of traditional archaeological method and theory.

This paper presents the results of a controlled experiment on the physical properties of different rock types designed to investigate lithic raw material variability and their effects on flake production. Using natural rock types, cores were uniformly designed from basalt, obsidian, and flint, and following protocols established in previous experiments, flakes are removed holding constant several independent variables and dependent variables, such as force, size, and shape, are recorded.  In addition to investigating the effects of different raw material types, the experimental results will evaluate the applicability of earlier experiments using glass cores to more traditional materials.

Fortunately, the popular IBM software package, Agisoft Photoscan, contains point cloud classification functionality, allowing researchers to categorize points according to their location or color. By doing so, users can classify and then disregard vegetation in generating elevation models, and in doing so produce a true DTM without the need for complex GIS manipulation.

We see evidence of stress in a change in settlement patterns between La Crosse and Riceford to more protected areas, more utilitarian ceramic vessels, the abandonment of key resources (e.g. wild rice, large river fish, large river mussels, etc.), and an increase in catlinite pipes. During the Protohistoric period, we see the Oneota shifting to a more protective and secluded stance.","north_america_midwest","","ceramic_analysis","warfare_violence_conflict","north_america_midwest  ceramic_analysis warfare_violence_conflict",21

While it is widely accepted that spear-throwers were used by the people of the ancient central Andes, comparatively little research has gone into the role that they had as weapons of war, hunting tools, and objects of ceremonial reverence. Many Andean societies have rich traditions of art and iconography, often portraying human and supernatural figures wielding and using spear-throwers in a variety of contexts and with notable associated symbols, such as avian imagery. In addition, the Andes developed a unique style of spear-thrower and have produced many examples of spear-throwers with exceptional craftsmanship, leading me to believe that these tools were given special reverence.

This poster will present the findings of my project, in which I used a review of iconographic depictions of spear-throwers bolstered by physical specimens and associated artifacts to determine the wider significance that these tools played in society.

Many studies have discussed the first century BC to first century AD Nabataean rock-cut monuments in the Nabataean city of Petra, Jordan.  These surveys provide information about proposed chronologies for the façade tombs and limited data about burial customs of the Nabataeans themselves.  One neglected topic is the Nabataean tomb placement in relation to the structural geology of the Petra region. During the 2014 field season of the BYU Ad-Deir Monument and Plateau project, it was discovered that the Ad-Deir Monument was built between geologic faults and fractures, suggesting that the Nabataeans used these features to carve the façade. In order to study the Nabataean knowledge of geology and the landscape used in the placement of their tombs, I have been working on a survey of the Petra façade tombs, with an emphasis on their relationship to the local and regional faults and fractures.

This immense empire operated primarily on two institutions: the crown and the sangha (Buddhist monkhood). Kutho (merit) was arguably one of the most important Buddhist doctrines in Bagan as it was believed to guarantee better social status upon reincarnation. Kutho, for the elite, was most commonly obtained by contributing large donations to the sangha. These donations took the form of labourers, tax-free lands, or precious materials that were used for the construction of temples and monasteries, of which thousands continue to survive today. The construction of these buildings would have displaced a sizeable amount of the commoner population whilst also establishing new settlements. Despite the extensive archaeological potential in this region, no settlement studies have been conducted in Myanmar. Through inscriptions, murals, and ground survey along with the application of entanglement theory, this study will determine how the crown and the sangha worked together influencing the settlement patterns of the commoner population. This study will bring insight into a relatively new area of research in a region that is only beginning to open for archaeological work.","asia_southeast_asia","","iconography_epigraphy","settlement_patterns","asia_southeast_asia  iconography_epigraphy settlement_patterns",11

Additionally, 21 LiDAR anomalies identified as potential features were uploaded to tablets used to navigate in the field. Consequently, the most common anomalies (“10m-diameter round pits”) were verified as bomb craters created during the U.S. invasion.

However, modern erosional processes—specifically flowing water—can limit the behavioral inferences that can be gained from surface assemblages by transporting materials from their original discard sites. The influence of these processes can be observed in the size distribution and condition of surface lithic assemblages. The topography and geomorphology of the landscape heavily dictates the degree to which fluvial processes erode and redistribute artifacts. Thus, considering formation processes alongside aspects of topography and geomorphology provides a means to investigate the extent to which modern geomorphological processes have altered surface assemblages. Here, we use digital terrain analysis to explore this relationship between the surface assemblages and modern erosional processes. We characterize the location of surface artifacts from the Koobi Fora Formation, Kenya, by stream power (erosive potential) and topographic wetness (the potential for water to pool). We then pair these data with attributes of stone tools that reflect post-depositional damage. We assess the overall influence of hydrological processes on the spatial arrangement of surface assemblages. A discussion of the applied methods and preliminary results is presented.

Despite being closer to high quality obsidian sources in Pachuca, Hidalgo, Los Mogotes relied on grey obsidian from sources located farther away (such as Ucareo, Michoacan). The lack of evidence of primary obsidian production suggests a down-the-line model of exchange of obsidian tools, many of which were later reworked into secondary or tertiary items.

Residential burials are useful tools that help archaeologists better understand domestic ritual practices at the household level. With the household acting as a unit of social identity, funerary practices help archaeologists relate said practices to prominent trends of the time. These include, but are not limited to social and religious structures, identity, power, and social reproduction. One of the many types of artifacts that often appear in Classic Maya burials that are significant to burial practices are ceramic vessels. Through the utilization of several whole ceramic vessels uncovered during the 2017 field season at the Maya city of El Peru Waka<U+0374>, this poster will attempt to explore the use of ceramics in funerary contexts at the site. In looking at mortuary vessels recently excavated in El Peru’s Chok Group, funerary contexts can help to reveal domestic ritual trends and purposes. After recovery of the vessels in the 2017 field season, they were brought to the lab where they were cleaned and analyzed. By using the type variety method, examining the vessels for presence of use ware, and original funerary context (through drawings and photographs) a better narrative of ceramic use in domestic funerary contexts is revealed.","mesoamerica_maya_lowlands","maya_classic","ceramic_analysis","mortuary_archaeology","mesoamerica_maya_lowlands maya_classic ceramic_analysis mortuary_archaeology",34

","Paleolithic","Lithic Analysis","Material Culture and Technology",FALSE,TRUE,"Stone artifact weathering is important for understanding the formational history of surface and in situ assemblages. While much of this work has focused on chert and other crypto-crystalline sillicas, the weathering of basalt is under-studied. As a large proportion of the Early Stone Age record consists of basalt, it is necessary to explore the weathering process of this material. Characterizing basalt weathering currently relies on the subjective characterization of both mechanical and chemical weathering properties. This is problematic as the rate at which these processes accrue depends on the depositional context. Thus, it is necessary to systematically understand how various weathering attributes accrue in different contexts. Here, we present a systematic analysis of basalt weathering in a variety of different sedimentary contexts. Taphonomic attribute data was collected from lithic assemblages from the Koobi Fora Formation in different depositional and temporal contexts. Multi-variate analysis was used to determine whether quantitative color estimations, the presence of crystals, and degree of edge and ridge rounding could be used to discriminate basalts from different depositional contexts. A discussion of the preliminary results is presented. This research was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, OISE awards 1358178 and 1358200.

In our enquiries we have also micro-CT-scanned individual textiles from archaeological contexts. Micro-CT-scanning enables detailed study of textile structures and sewing patterns. Individually scanned items include caps and knitted products with multiple textile layers that otherwise could not be studied without breaking the items. The greatest benefit of this method is the undestructive research that allows to peek inside textile structures and coffins.","europe_northern_europe","historic","textile_analysis","historical_archaeology","europe_northern_europe historic textile_analysis historical_archaeology",14

Menorca is a UNESCO biosphere reserve and candidate for World Heritage status. Menorca preserves archaeological and cultural sites from every period of its history, ranging from megalithic Bronze/Iron Age settlements to the remains of the Spanish Civil War. The island’s rich cultural legacy, together with its impressive and diverse natural settings, makes it an outstanding laboratory for studying heritage management.

During the field school we introduced students to the principles and practice of archaeological stewardship: preservation, interpretation, management, and public outreach. There is nothing more eye-opening than learning this in situ: at sites, museums, and throughout the landscape. A student project researched links between the US and Menorca. From Admiral Farragut to the Second World War, students discovered a fascinating common past worth safeguarding for the future.

Every human being is exposed to risk, but depending on the social and biological characteristics of individuals may be more or less susceptible to irreversible damage. The risk is a dynamic concept; thus, vulnerability may only be evaluated in terms of relative parameters. In this study, I will focus specifically on the risk of death in past urban societies in connection with the everyday life, using the archaeological contexts to create social variables. This theoretical and methodological model proposes four areas to assess vulnerability as follow: Demographic dynamics, Frailty, Inequality, and Embodiment.  The first three areas are used to apply statistic model, while the fourth area, is based on qualitative analysis. 
To test this theoretical and methodological model that I am proposing, I am applying this model of Vulnerability in a Mesoamerican sample, at Monte Alban city, the most ancient urban settlement in Mexico. Wherein, preliminary results already shows that the propensity of risk of death during the adulthood increased, in correlation with house size and location of the house.

The Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission has incorporated the database findings, documented submerged archaeological sites, and other data-sets into GIS so that information can be analyzed in a spatial manner. 

Over 1,000 shipwrecks have been identified as a “total loss” and may prove to have archaeological remains present. More than 650 other documented wrecking events do not have enough information to determine if remains are likely, but with further research may prove significant. Integration of GIS data with the known shipwreck sites aims to advance knowledge of the Rhode Island submerged maritime landscape, which will ultimately assist in mitigation efforts during future development undertakings. This project investigates both the advantages and limitations of utilizing an archaeological sensitivity model for submerged cultural materials, and questions the opportunities and restrictions of a GIS based approach for analyzing shipwreck sites.","north_america_northeast_midatlantic","historic","digital_archaeology_gis","cultural_heritage_preservation","north_america_northeast_midatlantic historic digital_archaeology_gis cultural_heritage_preservation",42

However, excavated material is often preferred over surface assemblages due to concerns of potential biases introduced by the process of exposure. Here, we examine this claim by comparing measures of stone tool transport between surface and excavated assemblages. Surface and excavated lithic assemblages were collected from the similar locations in East Turkana, Kenya. Size distributions of each assemblage were compared to determine differences that may be introduced by taphonomic bias. Measures of cortex, volume, and stone tool reduction were then applied to each assemblage to determine influence of lateral displacement on proxies of stone tool transport. Preliminary results suggest that, despite gross differences in size distributions between the two assemblages, signatures of stone tool transport preserved in excavated assemblages are also reflected in surface assemblages. This is dependent on the measures of transport that are investigated.

Surface survey along the lake periphery and riverbanks indicates historical occupations beginning as early as the late 1700s, continuing until the mid-1900s. Examining the distribution of artifacts from these disturbed sites by material type proportions and temporal spans will shed light on occupational patterns and social dynamics for this underinvestigated region. The composition of the glass and ceramic assemblages will investigate food preservation patterns, availability of consumable resources, and household economics. Self-reliance and sustainability are continued cultural traditions in this mountainous region and would have played a major role in the maintenance of an autonomous homesteading household.

Through time, and with an expanding suite of religious practices and paraphernalia, populations across the region became increasingly aggregated in villages and possibly exhibited differentiated social status. Did Woodland period religious movements fuel village aggregations and incipient social inequality? 

We test these apparent correlations through a multifaceted study of nearly a dozen burial mound assemblages from across northern peninsular Florida, seeking to infer patterns of human mobility, social interaction and community formation in the context of mortuary rituals. Isotopic analysis of skeletal populations are combined with demographic and life history information from individual secondary interments to model patterns of diet and mobility. Neutron Activation Analysis of pottery, compared with data from clays across the region, is used to source ornate mortuary wares. Results indicate that frequent transport of mortuary pots and possible integration of disparate populations were fundamental to religious expansion and social change.

To create these models, I combine regional digital elevation models (DEM), satellite imagery, with archaeobotanical datasets from the multi-period sites of Aparani Berd and Tsaghkahovit. I then use modern climate data and paleoclimate proxies to calculate growing degree days (gdd) for these cereal crops and predict optimal planting locations in relation to these sites.

Their origins, and the role they played in local markets, are debated. This poster explores the interpretive implications of the results of laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and neutron activation analysis (NAA) on nearly 400 coarse earthenware sherds from eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century plantation contexts across Jamaica. Using comparative datasets from the UK, US, and Caribbean, we pinpoint sources for the course earthenware and explore the temporal and spatial patterns in the use of earthenware from different sources.

These analyses have revealed that the sediments consist of several classes ranging from calcium hydroxide crystals, ilmenite, magnesium aluminum silicates, and calcium silicates that represent naturally occurring parent materials found in the Sigatoka River Valley. Other analyses include petrographic microscopy (XPL), phosphate burnoff, organic matter burn-off, carbonate burn-off, and radiocarbon dating. Geoarchaeological analyses such as these are critical to understanding the natural and cultural history of Naihehe Cave, as the site is associated with the first agriculturalists in Fiji, and may reveal new information pertaining to the settlement of the archipelago during the Lapita and Post-Lapita period.

A reanalysis of the debitage shows that late stage biface production, expedient flake-tool production, and the production, repair, and replacement of projectile points were all common activities at the Hackney site. A recent analysis of the projectile points that included a characterization of macro-damage, also showed distinctive use-breakage patterns that suggest it may be time to reexamine the hypotheses surrounding the function(s) of Humboldt/Sierra concave-base series points. Such points are hypothesized to have been used as knives, dart points, or even dispatching spears. The Humboldt points present in this assemblage are all broken with abundant evidence of impact damage. Moreover, an examination of reports on assemblages from other contemporaneous sites in the Sierra Nevada region and elsewhere suggests this is a widespread pattern. To examine the potential cause(s) of these features, we conducted experiments testing macro-damage created in use as a knife, dispatching spear, and atlatl propelled spear. We present here the results of the projectile point assemblage analysis and some preliminary findings from the use experiment.

Frequencies of the families were compared between the early settlement period (~2850-2900 cal BP) and the subsequent Plainware/Aceramic period. Larger-bodied Lethrinidae, which are common in both periods, show a decline in relative abundance, while smaller-bodied Acanthuridae show a corresponding increase in abundance. Although this pattern might be viewed as evidence for resource depression, potentially linked to intensive fishing of Lethrinidae, bone measurements show no decrease in the size of Lethrinidae over time. A number of factors can account for the change in taxonomic abundance. While the relative abundance patterns may be a result of change in reef productivity caused by increased pressure on Lethrinidae, they could also indicate a shift in fishing techniques, or intensification of fishing involving the addition of a wider range of species to the food inventory.","pacific_islands","","zooarchaeology","coastal_island_archaeology","pacific_islands  zooarchaeology coastal_island_archaeology",18

One variable state regularly recorded is that of cortex. The presence/absence of cortex is often linked to reduction intensity with variable cortical frequencies linked to early or late stage reduction and potentially reflective of residential mobility. However, we lack reliable markers or values to support our interpretations. Recently, Harold Dibble (and others) have proposed a method for evaluating assemblage cortex by comparing observed and expected frequencies. These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility. This paper applies the method developed by Dibble and others to the lithic assemblage from the Beaucoup site (24PH188/189) in northern Montana, a Late Prehistoric site with spatially distinct kill, processing, and residential areas. The lithic raw materials found in the assemblage (particularly quartzites) occur on-site and, as a result raw material size, shape, and origins are known. Our preliminary examination of cortex patterns indicates spatial differences between the areas of the site which may reflect variations in residential mobility.

Its geographic location and its relatively narrow expanse, makes the southern half of Middle America the natural stage to funnel terrestrial and coastal/riverine routes of early human migrations. Despite this consideration, archaeological research targeting Paleoamerican horizons [pre-12,800 BP] in this area has only witnessed intermittent treatment, in part due to a rich tradition intensely focused in Maya archaeology, mainly in Guatemala and Belize. An intriguing aspect of the Paleo-Central American legacy is the coexistence of two great contemporary lithic traditions of the American continent: South American “Fishtail” points and North American Clovis assemblages.  This may suggests that Central America was a zone of technological innovation where traditions merged. A preliminary analysis of available fluted points from Central America vs. North American Clovis, points to an expansion of this technocomplex at least as far as Venezuela. Moreover, morphological similarities between Central American lanceolate points and Clovis collections from the U.S. South-Eastern/Gulf regions indicate that a set of cultural connections may have existed along a now submerged Late Pleistocene Atlantic coast.","central_america_northern_south_america","paleoindian_paleoamerican","lithic_analysis","mobility","central_america_northern_south_america paleoindian_paleoamerican lithic_analysis mobility",29

","Paleolithic","Zooarchaeology","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers",FALSE,TRUE,"Understanding if and to what extent early anatomically modern humans adapted to dramatic climatic events is essential to human origins research.  Pinnacle Point — a complex of cave sites and rockshelters along the southern coast of South Africa — offers a unique opportunity to study human adaptability through time. The long sequence at Pinnacle Point Site 5-6 (PP5-6) spans 164 - 44 thousand years ago and encompasses two Interglacial to Glacial Marine Isotope Stage transitions (Stages 5-4-3). This study analyzes faunal remains dated to the MIS 5-4 transition occurring early in the sequence at PP5-6. The change in climate during this transition caused the Paleolithic coast to retreat, possibly necessitating a change in resource procurement strategies by humans occupying the cave. The extent and nature of this change is examined through surface modifications (i.e. cut marks, percussion marks and notches), extent and location of burned remains, and the species composition of fauna transported to the site. Preliminary results suggest that the frequency of surface modification and burning increased during the transition. This zooarchaeological analysis will add to research on the adaptability of early humans to environmental shifts at Pinnacle Point.

Unlike traditional site documentation techniques applied throughout the discipline, digitalization of data while in the field presents distinct advantages for the study and preservation of both cultural heritage and archaeological data collections. These methods include the production of digital 3D maps, from both aerial and hand-held photogrammetry, data collection with tablets using project specific and updatable forms, near real-time data entry into a secured locally hosted onsite database, and increasing data integrity through pre-printed unique barcodes for each artifact and sample collected. We implemented these techniques for the Northern Mongolia Archaeology Project located in Darkhad Basin, Khuvsgul province, northern Mongolia, and the Tsagaan Asga Project, located in Bayan-Ulgii province, western Mongolia. By creating high-resolution maps in both visible and near-infrared light combined with the spatially aware data collected, the result is a fully digitized site to assist in data organization and analysis so that the focus is less on the data entry and more on the data queries.","asia_central_asia","bronze_age","digital_archaeology","landscape_archaeology","asia_central_asia bronze_age digital_archaeology landscape_archaeology",11

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.  This study hopes to test each these dynamics through the nondestructive analysis of ceramics excavated from Machu Llacta using a Bruker Tracer Vi handheld pXRF unit.

","Maya: Postclassic","Bioarchaeology/Skeletal Analysis","Colonialism",TRUE,TRUE,"The Colonial site of Tipu and pre-contact site of Baking Pot offer a unique perspective of the transition of Maya life in western Belize after Spanish contact. Tipu is a borderland town largely occupied from AD 1541-1704. Baking Pot was a regional civic-ceremonial center continuously occupied from the Late Preclassic (~400 cal BC) to the Terminal Classic periods (cal AD 800-900), and later reoccupied during the Late Postclassic (cal AD 1280-1420).
Oral “health” and carbon and nitrogen isotopic values were assessed from skeletal samples. Baking Pot bone collagen isotopes are lighter than Tipu (-11 ( +1.0) and -9.8 ( +1.4), respectively), suggesting slightly more consumption of C3 foods. Apatite supports a greater consumption of C3 foods at Baking Pot -6.6 ( +0.6) compared to Tipu -5.3 ( +1.4). Nitrogen values are the same, Tipu +9.2 ( +0.8) and Baking Pot +9.2 ( +1.3). Isotopic values are indicative of a diet of marine fish and maize at both sites. Oral conditions vary. By tooth count, Baking Pot has more instances of caries compared to Tipu, but more individuals from Tipu experienced tooth loss during life. The differential dietary patterns are reflective of varying oral condition frequency and overall oral “health.”

In this poster, we examine these transformations through the lens of technological, i.e. those aspects of pottery manufacture that reflect shared technical choices and transmitted knowledge. At the site of Tel Miqne-Ekron, morphological analysis has defined two distinct but contemporary potting traditions: a non-local and an indigenous one. In this study, petrographic analysis of ceramic thin sections are used to first test these observations. Secondly, we examine changes over time in clay and temper use. As raw material use is tightly linked to almost all other aspects of the ceramic production process, e.g., drying time, firing, manufacturing style, vessel function, many observed stylistic changes in the non-local ceramics probably resulted from the need for foreign potters to adapt to local resources. Recognizing shifts in raw materials, and thus resource acquisition, should provide new insights into understanding the working relationships between these two co-habiting populations.","asia_southwest_asia_levant","iron_age","archaeometry__materials_analysis_ceramic_petrography","craft_production","asia_southwest_asia_levant iron_age archaeometry__materials_analysis_ceramic_petrography craft_production",40

However, in populations with intentional artificial cranial modifications, the only option is scoring non-metric cranial traits since the craniometrics are too heavily affected by the modifications. Studies have shown that although non-metrics are the best alternative, some traits cause a bias that can differ based on the broad modification categories of annular and tabular. This study aims to add to these data by assessing the influence of the sub-categories of oblique and erect within the annular modification category and the degree of modification. The sample population consists of individuals from the Chanka cultural group located in the South-Central Andes of Peru during the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1000-1400). A total of 33 non-metric traits were scored on 102 individuals, 88 of which have modified crania. Analyzing the influence of sub-categories and degree of modification can point to a finer scale analysis of how and why certain traits are influenced by cranial modifications.
