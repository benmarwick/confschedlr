current research at garden patch (8di4), a middle woodland mound center with circular village construction in northern peninsular gulf coast florida, provide quantitative insights into the timing and temporality of monument construction and village aggregation. here, we combine previously modelled radiocarbon assays with new isotopic data on season of collection and habitat of exploitation. the four-phase model of site occupation when combined with the new isotopic data provide new insights into the relationship between native subsistence practices and rapid village construction events.
