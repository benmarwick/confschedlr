the riverside 2 site, situated along the original shoreline of the island of manhattan, presents a unique opportunity for landscape reconstruction within an urban archaeological context. drawing upon geoarchaeological borings, excavation units, and historical sources, we created a 3d gis model of the site highlighting its role in the development and transformation of the emerging neighborhood of the upper west side in the 19th century. the results of these research efforts have recently been put on view in a permanent gallery housed within the development project whose construction precipitated the archaeological excavation.
