a newly identified figurine type in the south east european first farmers’ cultural world is discussed. differing from all early neolithic “idols”, this figurine is monumental in size, but also significant in various other aspects. almost each of its features opens new perspectives in interpreting early cult objects, including their gender issues.   
the horned clay figurine emerging from a podium, a table-like or a low roundish stand appears to have replaced the rather well known “goddess figurines” of south east europe. these figurines depict the female upper body emerging from a lower part that is often called “house models” or “altars”. in our case, the emerging body is not human, but apparently that of cattle. 
   generally, all horned bovid representations are regarded as bull figurines, representing the male procreative power. the one presented here has a realistic relief of a female genital organ, must be a depiction of a cow. i shall focus on this apparent bias in archaeological literature, which unfolds data about the early cattle husbandry and milking, explaining the appearance of cow representations in early farming communities.
