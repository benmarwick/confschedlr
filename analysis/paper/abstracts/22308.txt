since 2010, the bvar project has conducted intensive research at the recently discovered site of lower dover, located directly across the belize river from barton ramie. a major part of the bvar investigations is to determine the socio-political relationship between lower dover, barton ramie, blackman eddy, and baking pot. other research questions have focused both on the monumental architecture of the site core, and on plazuela groups in the periphery of site’s epicenter. one such peripheral house group, classified as group g, consists of 5 mounds that enclose a small plaza just north of center’s ballcourt. this paper presents the results of our investigations on group g, compares the development of this household with that of the site center, and discusses the potential relationships between site cores and adjacent patio groups.
