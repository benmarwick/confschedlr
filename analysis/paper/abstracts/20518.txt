our understanding of early bronze age copper smelting in the southern aegean has improved dramatically in the last two decades through a combination of fieldwork, laboratory analyses and experimental reconstructions (betancourt 2006, bassiakos, 2007, pryce 2007).
 
the currently accepted model for primary copper production has been largely based on the outcome an experimental campaign (pryce et al. 2007). while this study accepts the value of experimental archaeology it challenges the current model and the specific manner in which the “aegean perforated furnace” is used. the new study has implications for ideas of resource perception and establishing the techno-typology for early copper metallurgy in the region.
 
these implications are discussed within the context of the early transmission of metallurgy across eurasia and the diversity of early technologies. the aegean region is shown to be a critical location for providing a perspective on the specifics of transmission.
