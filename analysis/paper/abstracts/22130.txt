since 1998, archaeologists from uw-milwaukee have conducted long-term, systematic excavations at the 12th-15th century crescent bay hunt club site (47je0904). the crescent bay hunt club site is unique among early oneota sites because of the three distinct forms of structures discovered at there.  this paper focuses on longhouses: portions of at least three longhouses have been recovered from the site. evidence suggests that these longhouses are at least two hundred years older than previously dated longhouse structures in wisconsin. analysis of the pit features, artifacts, and burials associated with these structures provides insights into overall site organization and function. comparison of these early longhouses with those typical of later sites illustrates the breadth of temporal and geographic variation exhibited at oneota sites.
