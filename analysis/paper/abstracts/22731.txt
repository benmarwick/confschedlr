in the middle formative, chalcatzingo was one of highland mexico’s dominant settlements. at its peak, chalcatzingo had a well-developed obsidian blade technology and established lines of trade with the gulf coast. chalcatzingo’s role in the exchange of obsidian in earlier periods is less well understood. this paper combines geochemical sourcing and technological analysis of an early formative obsidian assemblage from chalcatzingo in order to elucidate this role. geochemical sourcing enables a better understanding of the exchange routes maintained by the emerging site, prior to its florescence, while analysis of lithic technology may reveal how blade technology arrived in chalcatzingo, and the form in which obsidian was transported.
