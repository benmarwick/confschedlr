throughout the eastern woodlands, the sparse early archaic (ca. 8700 – 6000 bc) paleoethnobotanical record primarily consists of seeds of fleshy fruits and fragments of nutshells.  here we present the preliminary results of the macrobotanical analysis of an assemblage from intact early archaic deposits at grizzly newt rockshelter in jackson county in eastern kentucky. the charred remains include several wild chenopodium seeds found in association with kirk corner notched points typically assigned to the early archaic. by the late archaic-early woodland transition, chenopodium seeds underwent morphological changes indicative of human-mediated selective pressures related to domestication. some of the earliest domesticated chenopodium specimens come from late archaic deposits (3700 bp) at cloudsplitter rockshelter in nearby menifee county, approximately 60 miles away. the grizzly newt rockshelter remains may reflect early human exploitation of the wild progenitor of this important member of the eastern agricultural complex. dating of the context is forthcoming.
