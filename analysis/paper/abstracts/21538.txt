in 2016, swca environmental consultants conducted a limited class ii cultural resource inventory in the bears ears area in order to test a predictive model generated on behalf of the monticello field office of the blm for a class i report. a historic stone-and-timber sheep corral with nearby rock inscriptions was located and mapped on the butler wash side of comb ridge during these efforts, and determined to be a historic ute site with navajo cultural elements. subsequent revisits to the site revealed that it was part of a much larger site complex, including a second sheep corral, a temporary camp and wood-cutting area, and the remains of a hogan with badly-weathered inscriptions on an adjacent rock face that included the name “mikesboy.” this talk presents the results of research on mikesboy and historic archaeology of the utes of bears ears.
