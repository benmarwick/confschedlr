this paper discusses advances in the development of a multimillennial ringwidth chronology based on bald cypress (taxodium distichum) from the mouth of the altamaha river in georgia. new insights into the environmental history of coastal georgia are discussed, including the archaeological implications of major climatic and ecological events visible in the ancient cypress rings. finally, we focus on environmental conditions before, during, and after the transition from the late archaic (ca. 4500-3100 b.p.) to the early woodland (ca. 3100-2400 b.p.), comparing the timelines of change indicated by tree-ring proxies to events occurring in the region and around the world in this period of global cultural and climatic upheaval.
