the civilian conservation corps (ccc), and other federally sponsored work programs, provided much needed employment during the great depression and have been examined extensively by scholars in a range of fields. however, few are aware that a parallel program, indian emergency conservation work, later subsumed into the ccc as the indian division (ccc-id), offered similar programs for native american young men and performed extensive conservation work on reservations. these men built roads, bridges, fences, and public buildings; fought fires; constructed dams and irrigation systems; and improved rangeland. these landscape features are now eligible for the national register of historic places, and this project outlines preliminary efforts to work with tribal governments to recognize and document ccc-id sites and structures.
