Such a transgression occurred in the Sierra Mazatan of Sonora, México. In 1902, a party of Yaqui warriors freed hundreds of enslaved Yaquis from haciendas near Hermosillo, and they sought refuge in the Sierra Mazatan.  Days later Mexican troops outflanked the Yaqui warriors and attacked the camp of women and children killing 124 Yaqui.  Three weeks later Ales Hrdlicka collected the skulls of 10 individuals, human bone, hats, blankets, weapons, and a cradle board from the battlefield.

Unfortunately, open access textbooks are not a well established form of knowledge dissemination amongst archaeologists and currently do not hold as much credibility as traditionally published works such as peer reviewed journals or printed textbooks. In hopes of contributing a chapter to an open access textbook, what are the keys to making such a background chapter successful? What elements are necessary to prove that such a chapter has validity in the eyes of archaeologists but also leverages the benefits of an open source textbook? What traditional textbook themes are required and what others should be left aside to improve the way that textbooks can be used to pass on background knowledge to new students?

The exact role that the Millo Complex played in this period of regional transition remains unclear.

We investigate in particular how the echoes of the Middle Horizon resonate in the genesis of the Late Intermediate Ica culture that emerged here thereafter. We present evidence that H-8 was first founded at this time (c. 1000CE), and operated as a caravanserai within an intensifying network of trade and exchange articulated by camelid caravans between a number of Ica Valley sites throughout the LIP. Lyon (1966) argues that the beginning of the LIP was marked by a revival of Middle Horizon iconography, suggesting particular cultural or political value of this period to the people of Ica. Moreover, the remote oracle/pilgrimage center of Pachacamac on the central coast appears to have exerted particularly powerful influence on Ica during the Middle Horizon, but also thereafter on the developing regional culture in Ica. This poorly understood relationship with the central coast may have had a pivotal role in the development and rise to power of the Ica people during the subsequent LIP period.",Symposium,Presenter,Sara_Morrisset,4,15,4,Su-morning

However, the relationship was not a simple, unilineal one with Wari the dominant core society and Nasca the passive peripheral society. Instead a bilateral relationship developed in which many things were shared between the two. Wari colonies and foreigners are found in Nasca, along with changes in local settlements, new mortuary practices, and new long-distance prestige goods. Many aspects of Nasca culture were incorporated by Wari including ceramic technology, iconography, flexed burial positions, and trophy head taking.

Among the pioneer studies of this region was Browman’s pedestrian survey of the Upper Mantaro valley between Jauja and Huancayo, Peru for his doctoral dissertation, during which he registered over 106 sites dating to the Middle Horizon. Using temporal data, qualitative descriptions of features and artifacts, photographs and maps from Browman’s original field notes and dissertation, we reconstruct his findings in ArcGIS to re-analyze changes in settlement patterns, architecture and ceramic distributions through time and space. By integrating these patterns with newly available information about the environmental, social, and political contexts of the region, we build on previous work using technology unavailable at the time of the initial field research.

Archaeologists have recreated daily life for people living in these places, producing many insightful studies of Tiwanaku diet, cultural bodily modifications, disease, and occasional incidents of trauma. Many colonists living far from the Tiwanaku heartland developed hybrid lifestyles, adopting some local practices while preserving other Tiwanaku traditions. The site Cundisa is located in modern-day Copacabana, approximately 60km across Lake Wiñaymarka and 90km over land from Tiwanaku. Cundisa includes a cemetery with Middle Horizon burials of 100+ individuals. While the majority of individuals were buried with Tiwanaku ceramics, isotopic and skeletal evidence suggests variation in geographic origin and lifestyles for the people buried here. In this paper, we present the results of preliminary skeletal analyses of diet, disease, trauma, and identity for these individuals and suggest the variation present in the sample indicates interregional connections between Copacabana, Tiwanaku, and the coast.

Our field excavations in 2012 and 2015 revealed a long-standing tradition of mortuary treatment that persisted even after the arrival of the Wari in the area.  While many components of this tradition appear to have originated locally, other components closely parallel Nazca populations, including patterns of trauma, funerary ritual and the presence of “trophy heads”.   The collective nature of the burials suggests the inclusion of both sexes, and all age groups.  Interestingly, we have detected a form of secondary burial for neonates and infants.  Our data suggest that many of them were not buried at the time of death, but rather at a later time, positioned next to adult women.  In this context, we argue that the Ramada mortuary tradition in the Vitor Valley was part of a long-standing practice that remained remarkably unchanged despite co-habitation of the Valley with altiplano populations, and that promoted ongoing communication between the living and the dead. These collective burials may point to social and/or biological units that were perpetuated even after dead.

Here we compare plant remains with human skeletal remains to understand dietary practices at Tenahaha in the Cotahuasi Valley (AD 850-1050). Tenahaha was built during the Middle Horizon as a communal space to take advantage of new social interaction spheres, stimulated in part by the Wari state. Tenahaha includes burial areas as well as food storage and preparation zones. Macrobotanical remains were found in public rather than private locations, indicating communal production of food and drink. Quinoa, tubers, and molle were ubiquitous at the site, along with maize, with chicha made of maize/molle produced and consumed there. These remains suggest a ritual or communal diet heavy in C3 foods, although taphonomy and food processing will also be considered as mediating factors. In comparison, stable isotope analysis of individuals buried at the site compare favorably to the elite inhabitants of the Wari secondary city of Conchopata, who ate a diet dominated by C4 plants (maize) and meat (maize foddered camelids). Taphonomic concerns should not be ruled out, but communal use of foods with deeper histories than maize suggests active differentiation between daily and ritual diet at Tenahaha.",Symposium,Presenter,Matthew_Sayre,4,15,4,Su-morning

While the expansion of the Wari empire is largely responsible for some of these changes, it has also become evident that inter-regional interactions were increasing among the local communities along the south coast and yungas zones during this period. Recent archaeological investigations, for example, have revealed foreign-local interactions between the Nasca and Arequipa regions during the Middle Horizon (ca 600-1000 AD).

",Other,Other,Ethics,"In 2014, inspired by the work on gender-based violence in field settings done by anthropologists Clancy, Nelson, Rutherford, and Hinde, I began investigating field safety for archaeologists working in the Middle East and North Africa, the region in which I work.  At that time, I was a trustee of the American Schools of Oriental Research – and I chair its Initiative on the Status of Women.  I began by quantifying problems (Survey on Field Safety: Middle East, North Africa, and The Mediterranean Basin: 2014, 2015), looking at gender-based violence and discrimination in field assignments and in post-field research and publication. 
My goals are to: determine factors contributing to safe/unsafe fieldwork environments; determine best practices and effective ways to implement them; develop standards, policies, protocols and trainings to educate excavators about relevant ethics and laws for field and research projects; and, under ASOR’s auspices, provide all excavators with much-needed information.  At The University of Arizona, I work with the offices of Title IX, Global Initiatives (Study Abroad), and the Dean of Students, and I am involved with the new Center for the Study and Prevention of Gender-Based Violence.

Private consulting firms contract with federal agencies to assist in compliance with federal laws such as NHPA, NAGPRA, ARPA and AHPA, and additional state laws. As contract archaeologists, we often work extended periods within small groups in isolated areas, which lends to work environments away from support systems of family and friends. Co-workers depend on each other for safety and support in more intimate environments than non-field work. This intimate nature of our work environment often permits lines between professional/formal relationships and personal relationships to blur. Consequently, individual behaviors, intentional or not, can result in uncomfortable and/or un-safe work environments. Field conditions can provide a context in which civil rights and Title IX can inadvertently be lost. In addition, the small, isolated nature of the group can act as a deterrent to speaking out against harassment or discrimination. I argue that CRM firms need to prioritize Title IX to the same degree as other federal laws that govern our work.

Colleges and their respective departments, become their home, faculty become mentors, and their fellow students become their family. An enormous amount of trust is placed in our departments and we are often left feeling alone. As graduate students and Teaching Assistant’s, we are required to receive orientation and training that address procedures within federal and institutional guidelines yet we receive no orientation to help us navigate abusive behavior, and consequently are placed in situations by those mandated to teach and mentor us, exposing us to harm and leaving us feeling powerless in both the classroom and the field. In archaeology, women and other non-cisgender students are at greater risk than their counterparts.

Tello and his theories about Andean civilisation are well-chronicled, much less work has addressed his engagements with archaeological illustration, its practices and desires, especially beyond his signature Chavín work. This paper examines the imagery and arguments of key publications by Tello and his student and intellectual disciple, Rebeca Carrión Cachot, on the Recuay culture (ca AD 100-700). Together, they discerned the culture’s fundamental diagnostics: pottery, architecture, stone sculpture and ritual practices associated with ancestor-fertility cult. Both employed these elements to epitomise archaeological styles and compartmentalise cultural regions, at the same time that they were positioned as units in broad comparative thinking (e.g., religion, complexity, diffusion, cosmology). The paper contends that their Recuay findings emerged largely out of collections work, ethnohistory and close analysis of objects and ‘artworks’.  Notably, field archaeology had little to do with their intellectual legacy on Recuay; rather it was won through ambitious visual arguments and analogies, and expressed most saliently by their use of illustrations in a ‘visual archaeology.’",Symposium,Presenter,George_Lau,3.5,12,3.5,Su-morning

a way to inspect the buildings’ incorporation into everyday indigenous lives. I will focus on the
work by German scientist Hans Heinrich Brüning (1848-1928). First arrived as an engineer hired
by the most important sugar haciendas of the region, Brüning’s interests quickly shifted towards
archaeological and ethnographic studies during his stay in the Northern Peruvian Andes between
1875 and 1920. His work was mainly focused on pre-Columbian Moche buildings and in
contemporary indigenous Moche populations, to the extent that his photographs are the earliest
documents of its kind. In this presentation, I will explore how Brüning’s images prove how these
buildings were part of contemporary indigenous roads, religion and labor; and how this
incorporation defined scientific understandings of indigeneity in this Andean region. In this
sense, Brüning’s images are relevant as they serve as ethnohistorical documents, as well as given
that they substantially explain the trajectories of archaeological sciences in this Andean region.

and present uses of these photographs by Moche descendants.",Symposium,Presenter,Walther_Maradiegue,3.5,12,3.5,Su-morning

Katrina J. Bettcher & Lidio M. Valdez 
In 1954, newlywed archaeologists Francis Allen “Fritz” Riddell and Dorothy Menzel arrived in the Acari Valley on the south coast of Peru with the purpose of investigating the site of Tambo Viejo as part of the Inca Royal Highway Project directed by Victor von Hagen. Various sites in the region were recorded and investigated. After retirement in the early 1980s, Fritz was drawn back to Peruvian archaeology. With the California Institute of Peruvian Studies, projects involving Peruvian and foreign archaeologists, as well as non-professional participants from Acari and abroad, revisited sites and investigated new findings.  Fritz was concerned about the destruction of sites that had been recorded in the 1950s so he worked with local officials and citizens to encourage preservation. Rescue excavations were carried out at Tambo Viejo. Materials from looted sites were recovered, catalogued and stored. Though he passed away in 2002, Francis A. Riddell’s legacy endures in the Acari museum that has been named after him and in continuing work at the site of Tambo Viejo.

Between 1811 and 1860 some 6,000 liberated Africans, as they were called, were re-settled in the Bahamas. These Africans served apprenticeship periods of six to sixteen years, at the end of which they were to be free. Archival documents and archaeological evidence suggest that these indentured Africans were able to maintain a stronger African cultural identity as they settled into their new lives in these tiny islands in the Americas. However, an 18th century black cemetery in Nassau indicates that, long before this population of ‘unacculturated’ Africans were being settled in the Bahamas, earlier communities such as this one were devising means for allowing members of their communities to express and maintain their African cultural identity.

The impact of “Kormantse” as a cultural entity on the interpretations of the formation and transformations of the African Diaspora remains a major challenge among academics as many questions about the origins, migration episodes of populations, events and the process(es) involved remain unanswered. While bio-anthropologists explore DNA evidence, using various techniques of sequencing for possibly identifying common African ancestral connections or relationships, the need to review various routes and sources of the migrations, as well as the associated historical circumstances and places continue to be very critical. This presentation examines selected maps and other related documentation for speculating about the possible origins or combination of origins and routes that may have triggered off or played various roles in the processes of the creation of what we often consider today as “Kormantse in the African Diaspora.”  Maps of selected slave trade and migration routes are reviewed against the backdrop of selected recent speculations and interpretations of “Kormantse” in the history and culture of the African Diaspora.

",Historic,Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology,Communities of Practice,"Incipient aspects of syncretic processes among Africans and Europeans had begun on the African continent from the fifteenth century, with a particular reference noted for religious practices. Considering the relatively isolated participation of the two groups within the early interactive sphere of West Africa, as well as the in-situ contexts of the African cultures, some syncretical expressions were evident, yet due to the disproportional ratio of populations, were more subtle on the continent. However, once the various African populations were forcibly transported to the Caribbean, eliminating a strong homogeneity of cultural traditions, the degree of interactive exchange between Africans and Europeans increased dramatically, resulting in more complex and open forms of syncretism. This presentation seeks to provide a discussion of how African-European syncretic processes manifested themselves in successful forms, such as with benign cognitive compromises relating to religious practices, as well as how these syncretic processes were also rejected, such as with conflictive cognitive aspects in forms of aesthetic expression. It is proposed here that variable degrees of syncretical effectiveness were based on the fundamental variation of African and European cognitive approaches, with two archaeological case studies presented, one of successful syncretism and another rejected syncretism on St. Maarten.

Though such developments pose academic challenges, an overlooked issue is how we communicate this information to students. A constantly changing foundation of knowledge that increasingly requires an understanding of complex theoretical techniques, coupled with the importance of student satisfaction surveys, educators are faced with a pedagogical dilemma: stick with ‘established’ teaching methods though they are increasingly recognised as being ineffective and may even alienate students from their passion of human origins, or invest more of what little time we have in developing new, innovative ways of teaching even if that increases the risk of failure. This paper presents two pedagogical exercises, developed over four years of undergraduate teaching, that ‘open up’ theoretical concepts in paleoanthropology by removing paleoanthropology entirely. Utilising a pop cultural staple in the form of Star Trek which addresses issues of speciation and diversity relevant to paleoanthropology, these exercises offer an innovative, fun, and informative way for students to learn, understand, and apply the theoretical underpinnings of species recognition and phylogeny; that once understood can be applied to the fossil record with a greater understanding and confidence than more traditional methods currently provide.",Symposium,Presenter,Andrew_Shuttleworth,3.25,11,3.25,Su-morning

been a difficult task. One suggestion has been our use of symbolic culture, the use and transmission of symbols intergenerationally. There is much discussion, however, about who the first ‘symbol users’ were, partly due to debates as to what actually makes something ‘symbolic.’ In this paper, I discus how anthropologists first came to use symbol as the sine qua non of modern human behavior. Then, using archaeological and fossil data from the Old World, I show that many of the behaviors that are often suggested to be the sole purview of Homo sapiens have their genesis in the more remote past. Drawing from semeiotic theory and the extended evolutionary synthesis, I argue that applying a more integrative theoretical framework can allow paleoanthropologists to discuss the behavior of our hominin ancestors without assuming too much or too little about their ‘humanness.’

In the specific context of the Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition, the notion of acculturation has usually been considered as a unidirectional, one-size-fits-all social mechanism to explain both the appearance of transitional industries and the disappearance of Neanderthals. However, considering the growing genetic evidence of sustained interbreeding between distinct hominin populations during the Pleistocene, it is likely that interpopulation interactions were more fluid and dynamic than often assumed under the acculturation scenario. To account for this, we present here a review of the notion of acculturation and the likely archaeological manifestations of its different forms. We then compare this against the archaeological record of Western Europe in order to demonstrate how a more nuanced and ethnographically-grounded approach to the notion of acculturation is needed in order to properly model and ultimately make sense of the full variety of human experiences in that critical moment of our evolutionary past.",Symposium,Presenter,Julien_Riel-Salvatore,3.25,11,3.25,Su-morning

Due largely to the plethora of scenarios produced by genetic and genomic data in the last few years, the demand for archaeological confirmation or refutation of diverse dispersal scenarios has increased. Yet our understanding of lithic assemblages is not sufficiently nuanced to answer these questions. This is compounded by research bias in some of the places of likely contact between multiple species/metapopulations, such as Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia. We review the history of key definitional concepts, such as Levallois and prepared-core technology, blades and bladelets, as well as retouch intensity and tool diversity in the context of shifting fossil identities of their makers. We ponder the effect of ecology, taphonomy, and function in determining our studiable units, and propose that the answer to separating populations probably depends on multiple lines of evidence that preserve different life ways rather than individual strands of material culture.

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Material Culture and Technology,"The eastern African Early Pleistocene witnessed critical shifts in climate, environment, hominin anatomy and behavior. The lithic record shows change within this broader context. After 1.8 Ma, Large Cutting Tools (LCTs), such as bifaces, entered the hominin lithic repertoire. These artifacts are widely viewed as the first evidence of lithic shaping. Many archaeologists theorize both cognitive and practical differences between “flaking” and “shaping” among knapping strategies. Most of these cognitive models are based on our current understanding of living human cognition, not that of Early Pleistocene hominins. Little empirical evidence supports these concepts’ usefulness for Early Pleistocene archaeology and the study of hominin cognitive evolution. Further, we often lack holistic information about non-LCT components of Early Acheulean lithic assemblages. Early LCTs, and associated non-LCT lithics, occur in the Kokiselei Site Complex in West Turkana, Kenya (1.8 – 1.76 Ma). This project fills a gap in the empirical research necessary for testing hypotheses about “shaping” and LCT emergence through holistic technological analyses of both LCT and non-LCT lithics at Kokiselei and an experimental program that investigates the knapping strategies employed by hominins at Kokiselei.

",Paleolithic,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis,Material Culture and Technology,"Raw material studies are becoming increasingly popular as the development of technical and methodological advances adds to the macroscopic and geological study of stone tools. In turn this improves our capability to create a link between a stone tool’s archaeological context and geological area of origin. This connection is often discussed in terms of hominin behaviour, such as organisation of subsistence, adaptation to environment, and forward planning. However, the growing body of data provided by provenance research raises the need to critically assess how this information practically translates into proxies of hominin behaviour. This question is particularly prescient when considering the efficacy of raw material studies in exploring the lives of archaic Homo, in this case Homo neanderthalensis. Middle Palaeolithic foraging behaviour has historically been seen as ‘non-curated’, lacking a depth of planning and adaptive response to dynamic environments (e.g. Binford 1979; 1982). However, recent advances in our understanding of Neanderthals, suggest a species capable of complex subsistence behaviour, such as transport and curation.

Collings, published  an article in Nature announcing a discovery of a similar archaeological assemblage in Malaysia that he named the Tampanian.

Many of these previously excavated collections are overlooked by potential researchers because of the perceived difficulties of re-establishing provenience and quantitative control for artifacts that have been long separated from their original archaeological context. Since 2009, the Veterans Curation Program (VCP) has rehabilitated 231 at-risk United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) owned archaeological collections. The Tombigbee Historic Townsites Project is one such collection. Completed in 1983, this project aimed to salvage data from three of the earliest towns situated along the Tombigbee River in the eastern region of Clay County, Mississippi.

The VCP invests in service members by providing competitive pay and technical training to bolster existing skillsets.  At VCP laboratories, the irreplaceable archaeological assets administered by USACE are repackaged and recorded using the most current techniques to ensure the safekeeping of our nation’s cultural resources for future generations.  To date, over 400 veterans have benefited from the program, of which 90% have either obtained employment or matriculated to colleges, universities, or certificate programs following program completion.

These issues continue to be important in the analysis of Paleoindian adaptive strategies and now include more controlled examinations of community patterning; microwear analysis; refitting studies; and lithic sourcing based on trace element analysis. New sites have been discovered resulting in the definition of site clusters and sites associated with paths.

Seventeenth century colonial chroniclers repeatedly mention a series of places and objects that surrounded political negotiations and efforts at alliance-building by Powhatan societies. While regional scholarship has focused on competition over subsistence resources, regional trade dynamics, and the regulated exchange of “prestige goods” as central to the development of these political structures, we shift the focus toward the engagement between these societies and specific places and objects whose enduring legacies spanned multiple generations. We argue that the development of the seventeenth century political geography was predicated on the maintenance of persistent ritualized spaces and the circulation of enduring objects whose shifting meanings connected the past and present, bolstered political structures, and facilitated the transfer of power from one generation to the next. Archaeological evidence indicates that shell and copper adornment objects entered the region during the thirteenth century, coinciding with the first appearance of palisade architecture, and the development of intentionally constructed ritual landscapes that served to create individual community identities, while at the same time drawing communities into a cross-regional political system.",Symposium,Presenter,Christopher_Shephard,3,10,3,Su-morning

Two of the larger pit features exhibited excellent bone preservation and were densely filled with a mix of aquatic and terrestrial fauna including large amounts of oyster, clam, and fish remains. Many of these specimens can be identified using traditional methods (i.e., comparison with a reference collection). The results of flotation from these two features, however, yielded tens of thousands of small fish vertebrae not typically identifiable using morphological characteristics alone.

This may take the form of illuminating historical silences, and for those archaeologists working in post-contact or colonial contexts this often means working with indigenous groups seeking governmental or popular recognition. In this paper, we explore our collaborative efforts to discover and characterize archaeological sites dating to the early historic era in the territory of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo people in central California.  Approved by the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, this research is explicitly designed to counter prevailing misunderstandings about the impacts of the Spanish mission system and subsequent iterations of settler colonialism, which are usually viewed as projects that eliminated native landholdings and cultural knowledge. Through the use of historic documents, early maps, ethnographic data, and targeted archaeological fieldwork, we are illuminating a complex refugium along Tomales Bay that sustained native people during the first century after the arrival of Europeans to the region.

While the discipline may congratulate itself for finally finding a way out of the twin traps of Enlightenment dualism and the humanism which underpins neoliberal geopolitics, we concomitantly run the risk of becoming even less relevant to society at large at a time when global conflicts are widely understood through the lens of competing and contested identities. Such identities are often framed as rooted in archaeological pasts as much mythical as material, but no less efficacious in the present. Drawing from experience in Northern Ireland, the discussion will focus upon the contribution of pragmatic philosophy in not only shaping ethical archaeological practice in conflict and post-conflict setting, but allowing for a significant and socially valuable role in conflict transformation.

First, what are the discourses and rhetorics of heritage—how is heritage invoked and talked about, like a sign of history, in making statements about the world? How has that shifted over time, as the term is increasingly invoked to explain and defend a wide range of actions and attitudes, and how do the different discursive communities who speak about heritage engage (or not) with one another? Most importantly, why have these discursive transformations not been accompanied by similar transformations in policy? The answer to that last question requires us to consider a second mode of heritage, namely, what does heritage do, as a sign in history, when it is invoked, encountered, and circulated? What does heritage activate, and what are its “practical effects”? Drawing on several examples including the recent removal of confederate monuments in the US, I argue that while operating in these two modes—as signs of and in history—heritage’s greatest potential for transformational change is when it ceases acting as a rhetorical device and instead becomes itself the center of experiential social action, such as through its encounter, circulation, or being made visible (or invisible).",Symposium,Presenter,Alexander_Bauer,2.75,10,2.75,Su-morning

What all these approaches share is a commitment to making archaeology contribute in concrete ways to finding solutions to contemporary challenges.

",Bronze Age,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis,Materiality,"For decades, descriptions of prehistoric Eurasian pastoral societies would present ceramic typologies as material evidence for macro scale economic, social, and ideological cohesion – and trans-Eurasian interaction. However, recent investigations that focus more on human-environment interactions and domestic economies reveal a more dynamic and varied past in micro-regions of Eurasia. Pastoral strategies dating to the 3rd-2nd millennium BCE were regionally diverse, and societies were engaged in contacts that extended beyond the steppe world confines. These new discoveries bring material assemblages back into focus with the fresh purpose of scientifically examining the spectrum of technologies and social dynamics that generated the materiality of Eurasian pastoralism. Through a focus on mountain campsites in Kazakhstan, this paper proposes that ‘operational complexity’, a new theoretical term to describe the varied technological behaviors and learning contexts behind the production of household and ritual items, was a central factor in shaping the materiality of Eurasian pastoralism and trans-Eurasian exchange.",Symposium,Presenter,Paula_Dupuy,4,15,4,Su-morning

The chain of mountains that stretches across Central Asia constitutes a geographical obstacle that slowed down the dispersal process. Special strategies of adaptation to high altitude regions were requires not only by humans, but also by plants that came along due to changes in season length, climatic conditions, UV intensity and other. Therefore, the mountain regions acted as geographical filters that influenced what plant species and their varieties gets dispersed to further regions of Eurasia. The territory of Kyrgyzstan (almost 90% of the territory lies above 1900 masl) constitutes a key area for the study of crop and animal adaptation strategies, as the filtering effect on plant and animal selection by communities here would have been the most distinct.

These are the key corridors that brought southwest Asian animals along with the western grains into China and Chinese cereals to the West. Recent research demonstrates that broomcorn and foxtail millet (both C4 plants) were the key staple food in this region during the third and second millennium BC, but it remains unclear to what degree humans also relied on animal protein. Here we closely examine the dietary importance of grains and meat at several sites in western China from this period. We compare previous bulk collagen stable isotope results with compound specific carbon isotope analyses of individual amino acids extracted from human and animal bone collagen. Because essential and non-essential amino acids reflect different components of diet, compound specific carbon isotope analysis offers a means to isotopically distinguish between protein and non-protein dietary components, making it possible to determine to what degree humans were consuming meat directly versus consuming animals that were fed millet.

",Neolithic,Zooarchaeology,Subsistence and Foodways: Domestication,"The foothills of mountain chains along river catchments, or “Hilly Flanks”, have repeatedly been shown to be key to understanding the origins of agriculture throughout Eurasia. During the Neolithic, sites in the northern part of China’s Fertile Arc (see Ren et al. 2016)—showing the the earliest evidence of the cultivation of Chinese Millets—are situated along China's own “Hilly Flanks”. In contrast, southern sites along the Arc cultivating rice, are located in a diverse array of landforms including piedmont plains and intermountain basins. Whereas the relationship between people, landscape, and the crops has seen significant academic study, the human-animal component has yet to be explored in detail. The pig is China’s earliest endemic domesticate, and may have been domesticated multiple times in this region. Through demographic reconstruction and stable isotopic analysis of pig populations from early Neolithic sites from the northern and southern parts of the Arc, belonging to the Xinglongwa <U+5174><U+9686><U+6D3C> culture in Inner Mongolia—representing the northern part of the Arc—and Jiahu <U+8D3E><U+6E56> from the Huai River Valley in Henan—representing the southern region, this paper intends to understand how landscape and local contexts shaped human-pig relationships and trajectories of domestication and management during this critical period in Chinese prehistory.

",Bronze Age,Experimental Archaeology,Landscape Archaeology,"Before 2000 BC, the Eurasian communities lived in a world of ‘relative isolation’: a protective rim of mountains and deserts centered by the uplift of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau separate the warm and well-watered semitropical and tropical lowlands of South Asia from the seasonal and arid temperate Central Asia, and the monsoonal East Asia from the westerly southwest Asia. Only when arduous desert and mountain trails had been explored were farming and pastoralism opened up to wider contacts. In the symposium, we explore the human strategies on the edges of this mountainous rim. Drawing from numerous methodologies including ethnoarchaeology, geoarchaeology, zooarcaheology, archaeobotany and isotope studies, we explore the recurrent themes of foothill locations of early settlers in the context of the trans-Eurasian exchange.

These non-invasive and limited-impact methods produce accurate results without causing extensive destruction to cultural resources. The study area, located along Loyalhanna Creek in Westmoreland County in western Pennsylvania, is managed by the US Army Corps of Engineers – Pittsburgh District (USACE). As a federal agency, the USACE is mandated to identify and preserve cultural resources by Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Unfortunately, federal agencies often face limited staffing, resources and funding to address management of cultural resources.

This comparison not only examines the spatial relationships within one Paleoindian site (27-CO-60), but also helps the author make inferences about the similarities and differences between two Paleoindian sites in close proximity.

My research focused on how archaeological and historical records could be used to answer questions about the farm's extant home and the property's history. In Pennsylvania and other states (and at the federal level) multi-use public land managers are responsible for similar structures and the associated archaeological sites. These resources are often located in remote areas with little or no associated primary records, which means there is no construction date available to assist with resource management and a significance assessment. Dendrochronology, or tree-ring dating, is an affordable and effective methodology that has the potential to date log buildings or structures whether primary records exist or not.

I created the second model for the Pinelands region of central New Jersey for the United States Air National Guard, Warren Grove Gunnery Range. Both regions—Yellowstone and the Pinelands—have enough previous archaeological data to propose a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) predictive model of prehistoric site locations. While construction of the models varied for a variety of reasons, I used generally similar modelling methodologies for both. However, these two models were developed from very dissimilar site locational data and from completely different regional landscapes. On one hand, the Yellowstone model was developed specifically for Paleoindian archaeological site locations over a large and diverse mixture of landscapes in the Great Plains and Rockies.

These approaches are important when addressing issues of who archaeology knowledge, interpretation, and sites belong to. Archaeological interpretations historically come from those in roles of academic authority, but we increasingly see acknowledgement of collaboration and contribution from community members not in those roles. A rise in diversity of cultural and heritage backgrounds among archaeologists is a factor in decentering approaches as they have been traditionally practiced. Encouraging this diversity should begin with archaeology education and exposure before college years.

Though ever present, Maya coastal sites were atypical – perhaps even idiosyncratic – in terms of how they were imagined and lived-in by the Maya. Critical to our understanding of these coastal settlements is the material culture traded and utilized by the occupants of these sites. In this paper we present our preliminary analysis of the ceramic and artifactual assemblages collected at the neighboring ancient Maya port sites of Vista Alegre and Conil during the 2016 and 2017 field seasons. Research at both sites included survey work and surface collection, off-structure test excavations, and architectural excavations.

To achieve a continues lateral understanding of the underlying sediments, a seismic survey was conducted. The survey area covered the immediate flooded area of Vista Alegre, focusing on zones that have morphologically changed throughout time,  flooded during sea level rise, and which showed promise as likely locations for use during maritime activity by the past inhabitants.  The seismic survey results provided evidence for sea-level rise, and revealed a ridge-basin structure that was congruous with natural trends observed terrestrially. This uniqueness could be attributed to significant differences in the submerged landscape, and possibly the presence of anthropologically-altered offshore features.

Inland from the site are freshwater wetlands (sabanas), while the near-shore waters of the restricted circulation lagoon are hypersaline. A significant research question is how the inhabitants of Vista Alegre accessed potable fresh water. We investigate this question by exploring the existence of freshwater offshore sinkholes, locally called Ojos de Agua in the surrounding area of Vista Alegre. Through the benchmarking of an aerial UAV based thermal image analysis and calibration at known ojos, we were able to successfully derive salinity variations due to point freshwater discharges in that area of the lagoon. We explain the methodology used to address correct radiometric measurements, thermal image stitching and identification of fresh-water discharge points. While it is still unclear whether such ojos were used for fresh water sources for the ancient Maya, understanding their geology and distribution provides indispensable information for the hydro-geological evolution of the area, and related coastal sites.

However, the vital source of potable water that would have supported this coastal settlement remains unknown. We present a hydrogeological assessment of the region to understand changing water sources over the last 2 millennia. Potential groundwater foci at the intersections of conjugate fracture sets are presently either mantled in sediments, and/or flooded by saline-hypersaline waters. Nearby surface drainage from rain-fed savannas also has seasonally variable salinity commonly exceeding potable limits. A number of shallow springs discharge a range of reduced salinity and cooler waters. These are locally called Ojos de Aguas, a form of flooded sinkhole. Casting the coastal landscape under the marginally lower sea levels of the late Holocene (-2m), some of the known ojos would have been terrestrial sinkholes/cenotes above sea level. Recent evidence indicates a downward tectonic movement of the Yucatan north coast, which would further leave the ojos unaffected by direct mixing with marine waters. Vista Alegre’s inhabitants may have benefited from cenote potable perennial water sources that are now clandestine due to the sea level and tectonic shifts.

The explosion of the USS Maine in Havana’s harbor has often been interpreted as the excuse used by the US to get involved in the Cuban War of Independence; a war that Cubans and Spaniards had been fighting since 1895, but rooted since 1868. Previous research has traditionally focused in the naval encounters of the Spanish and US fleets in Santiago de Cuba, or the end of the war with the occupation of Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam, thus underestimating the role of the Cuban troops and leaving the early events of the war poorly explored. Our research focuses on the first battle of the war, which occurred on Matanzas Bay, Cuba, on April 27th, 1898.

Around the transition into the Early Classic, a notable demographic increase corresponded with a major construction episode at La Cariba.

Zooarchaeological analysis demonstrates that the site’s ancient inhabitants made use of this diversity, exploiting many terrestrial and aquatic taxa in subsistence and ritual activity. This paper summarizes major zooarchaeological findings from the duration of the La Corona Regional Archaeological Project. Excavations at La Corona have not targeted areas expected to be “fauna rich” and have produced approximately 5,000 specimens, but this relatively low count belies the interpretive value of the material. Zooarchaeological remains at La Corona from a discrete feasting event and palace middens reveal dietary flexibility and breadth by the high elite, including exploitation of smaller-bodied mammals. Animal bodies in these contexts operate as symbol as well as subsistence. This symbolic role is also present in faunal remains from burials at La Corona, where both fresh- and saltwater aquatic species associate the deceased with the watery Underworld. The diversity of remains found at La Corona, coupled with the rich information that deposits have provided to date, indicate the site’s noteworthy potential to inform our understanding of ancient Maya human-animal relations.",Symposium,Presenter,Diana_Fridberg,4,15,4,Su-morning

 The regal palace of La Corona flanks Plaza A to the West and is the largest construction at the site: a complex of structures sitting atop a sustaining platform extending over ca. 80 x 55m, and 7m in height. This paper describes the architecture of the two northern groups of the regal palace during their two last phases of construction, spanning roughly 750-850 A.D. While the Northeast Group comprised elaborately decorated corbel-vaulted buildings, the Northwest Group featured a mix of sturdy corbel-vaulted rooms and semi-perishable structures. This paper focusses on architectural designs, layout, and features, allowing to reconstruct the functions of the buildings, which include: residential, economic, administrative, ceremonial, and communicational functions.

Also, we will review techno-functional and use-wear aspects related to chipped stone artifacts found in the same context.

The Manteño were one of many pre-Hispanic cultures exchanging local resources, engineering new technologies, and mass-producing goods along the coast of Ecuador.  Successful in their chiefdom and independent from the expanding Inca Empire, the Manteño remained culturally uninterrupted for more than 800 years.  The focus of this research is to understand the interruption and thus abandonment of the cloud forest.  In order to understand abandonment processes in the Las Tusas valley, this research uses behavioral and contextual lines of evidence.  Areas of activity are established by comparing soil chemical indicators (phosphate and pH), with ceramic analysis, and overall artifact distribution.  Pre-abandonment behavior will then be examined within the social, political, and environmental context of the last occupation at site C4-044.  The sum of this information will be further assessed in accordance with ethnohistorical perspectives from individuals whom participated in the abandonment of a modern day village in the cloud forest.

The region is home to 40 known Manteño sites with more than 100 stone structures across the river valleys of La Encantada, Las Tusas and La Mocora that carve the foothills of the Bola de Oro mountain. The Florida Atlantic University Archaeological Fieldschool in Ecuador, directed by Valentina Martinez, recorded 23 of these sites and 94 stone structures in the summers of 2015, 2016 and 2017. The analytical portion of this study utilizes the dimensions and features along with the location and orientation of each structure to create categories that will serve to better understand how the Manteño utilized their space.  Geostatistical tools in GIS helped create categorical maps for interpretation. Our results suggest that the Manteño maximized their ability to utilize the limited available flat space and densely occupied the area. These Manteño settlements in the foothills of Bola de Oro are not small peripheral occupations but mirror the large dense populated foothills of other Manteño centers such as Jaboncillo y Hojas in central Manabí.",Symposium,Presenter,Andres_Garzon-Oechsle,2.5,9,2.5,Su-morning
