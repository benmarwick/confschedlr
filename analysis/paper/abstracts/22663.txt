in this presentation, we will examine rituals of hunting and feasting in late bronze age tel ifshar, a medium-size 4 ha site on israel’s coastal plain. the late bronze age in israel was a time of social change as egyptian influence—political, cultural, and religious—steadily increased in intensity, and became more and more entangled with the local canaanite culture. at ifshar, we have evidence for the phenomenon of feasting in the archaeological record through ceramics and faunal remains, and suggest viewing this activity as part of vertical patrimonial relationship in which the client gained capital and the patron reinforced the bond over the client. it has been argued, that ritualized feasting and conspicuous consumption played a significant role in maintaining the patrimonial system that is currently theorized to have been employed in canaan. however, this role has mainly been discussed in relation to large sites and focused on the relationships between peers. this presentation seeks to shed light on the phenomenon of feasting and hunting at smaller, mid-level sites and what that could mean in the context of canaanite society.
