marine mammals, including whales and seals, were a source of meat, blubber, baleen, and bone to the settlers of martha’s vineyard from the earliest occupation until the historic period. numerous species of whales have been observed in new england’s shallow waters, including migratory species like the north atlantic right whale (eubalaena glacialis) and other marine mammals like the harbor seal (phoca vitulina). during the 17th and 18th centuries, the wampanoag on martha’s vineyard and neighboring islands negotiated drift whale rights with the english, reserving claims to dead whales on sold lands, particularly along the southwestern coast. stranded whales were also trapped and driven ashore at nearby coasts. 

in this paper, the role of drift whales and other beached finds is assessed at the frisby butler site, located along the southwestern shore of martha’s vineyard. marine mammals account for less than 1% of the total assemblage but represent at least four separate species. how can we explain the diversity of these taxa at a site otherwise focused on deer and inshore fishing? in particular, this research questions whether infrequent whale bones are indicative of scavenging drift whales, offshore hunting, or perhaps dispersed trade practices.
