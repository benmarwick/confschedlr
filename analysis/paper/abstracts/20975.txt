this study examines the spatial patterning of shield iconography at late pueblo iii sites (a.d. 1250-1300) in the tsegi canyon system, as an indicator of shared group identity. in the mid-13th century, the tsegi canyon region of northeastern arizona followed a greater regional trend of communities coalescing into defensive high canyon alcoves, accompanied by the adoption of shield iconography, likely influenced by freemont traditions to the north. these images are variously interpreted to represent clan symbols, warning signs to enemies, or magically imbued protective icons. in the tsegi area, this motif followed a strict spatial pattern of placing large, usually white, shield imagery on the right side of cliff dwellings. by comparing the spatial placement of shield imagery on pueblo iii sites throughout the northern southwest, it is evident that the communities of the tsegi canyon system may be differentiated through their commitment to the placement of these iconic, highly visible pictographs on the right side of cliff dwellings. rather than the imagery adorning the shields, group affiliation among tsegi populations is best demonstrated by this formalized placement of the motif on defensive sites.
