for decades, paleoethnobotanical research almost exclusively concentrated on reconstructing past subsistence economies. at 2011’s saa conference, i presented a paper entitled, toward a paleoethnomedicine. i suggested that paleoethnobotanical research should take inspiration from ethnomedicine (a subfield of ethnobotany) and concentrate on analyzing past people’s healing practices and performances. this paper presents a method to operationalize this concept, a technique for analyzing paleoethnobotanical data to detect past medicinal plant usage. the general observations from ethnobotany/ethnomedicine about modern medicinal plant use gives researchers an idea of expected observations in the paleoethnobotanical/ paleoethnomedicine record. a common practice in macrofloral analyses is to calculate the ratio of a plant group (food, nut shell, charcoal etc.) in order to provide evidence of the certain activities at a site. this paper presents a new ratio extrapolated for plant observations from archaeological contexts and includes the results of a pilot study based on the paleoethnobotanical data from birka and other late iron age/medieval sites in east central sweden.
