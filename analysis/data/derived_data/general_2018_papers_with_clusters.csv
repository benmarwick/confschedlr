This presentation aims to discuss Public Archaeology (PA) from a Brazilian approach. Based on a study that includes a bibliographical survey, and the analysis of the papers presented at scientific meetings in Brazil, I examined: a) the role of PA in the contemporary agenda of the archaeology in Brazil; b) the connections between PA, Heritage Education (HE), and the development projects, and c) its relationship with the decolonizing perspective of the discipline in Latin America.  In addition, I also recognize gender issues in the domains of PA in the country, which is mostly linked to women, either as authors of academic literature or as coordinators of events, actions, and projects of PA (or HE). Finally, I critically analyze my own work within Public Archaeology in Amazon. Such questions have made me reflect  about the concepts and goals that legitimate the category “Public Archaeology”.

Sociopolitical Strategies in Northwestern Scandinavia in the Early Bronze Age","Europe: Northern Europe","Bronze Age","Other","Social and Political Organization",FALSE,FALSE,"Along the northwestern coast of Scandinavia the reliance and utilisation of the sea set the stage for a more advance sociopolitical organization. The technological innovations prompted by the Late Neolithic (i.e. ship technology), turned the sea into a connective arena of interaction and trade. This is seen with the widespread distribution of finely crafted Jutish flint daggers from Late Neolithic I, followed by a steady increase of metal, burial mounds, and settlement sites in Late Neolithic II and the Early Bronze Age. Despite having a material culture expressive of a region well-integrated within a Nordic World System, these societies are juxtaposed by a long coastline of climatic and ecological distinctiveness that forces insular practices in subsistence and organization. This paper will explore the contrasting practices in sociopolitical organization and the strategies implemented to take advantage of the local resource potential. The dependency of trade is identified as a key element to uphold power in certain regions, exercised through coercive strategies, but the paper also points to the inevitable fragility of such an organisation and the more long-term stability of cooperative strategies.

This paper details the results of archaeological survey in the Wind River Range, Wyoming between elevations of 9,000 and 11,000 ft. The purpose of this survey was to test a predictive model of a specific site type (sites referred to as villages) created by Stirn (2014) and tested by Stirn in a different region of the same mountain range. Although the methods of creating the predictive model were not altered, the survey methods were significantly altered. Random survey blocks were created within the project area to better sample the landscape for archaeological sites. The use of GPS track logs allowed for quantification of survey intensity and highlighted areas that were not intensely surveyed. The distribution of sites and the quantified surveyed area were compared in order to rule out survey bias as a factor influencing the discovered distribution of sites. The model was not successful in discovering alpine village sites and the distribution of the newly discovered sites can be explained by survey bias. Comparison of lithic assemblages including tools and debitage indicate that the newly discovered sites and previously discovered village locations have differences in tool diversity and debitage:tool ratios, but contain similar attributes of debitage assemblages.

Abstract
The British Museum has in its collections an assemblage of 188 stone Paleoindian projectile points and Later Archaic arrowheads that were purchased in 1962 from T.C. Kelly a Colonel in the USAF who was based for a time at RAF Mildenhall in the 1950s. I came aware of the collection and its potential importance whilst I was employed as Curatorial Assistant in the 1990s at the British Museum Quaternary outstation at Franks House, and later when researching Clovis Paleoindian projectile points for my Masters dissertation in 2008 to 2010. 
 The inventory in the British Museum register for the Kelly collection, shows there was some attempt to identify the points by the museum staff at the time, and after reading communications between Col Kelly and Gale Sieveking, who was Assistant Keeper of the Department and worked on the Palaeolithic collections at Franks House at the time. But the descriptions were quite vague and some of the points were misidentified, and the collection remained unseen and studied for 40 years after its original registration.

Theoretical morphology proceeds by creating and examining hypothetical specimens not actually found in nature. So instead of asking “why does feature X exist”, a theoretical morphological approach asks “why doesn’t feature Y exist?”. Here, we use this approach to address the question of why ceramic technology did not evolve to replace stone technology with respect to hunting weapon tips (spear points, atlatl dart tips, arrowheads). In other words: why didn’t the ceramic projectile point emerge? Clay is a readily available, economically efficient, and easily workable raw material. Likewise, objects made out of fired clay are extremely hard, sharp, and generally durable. We hypothesized that there was perhaps a functional constraint such that ceramic hunting weapon tips cannot perform as effectively as stone ones. We conducted an archaeological experiment using stone and ceramic replicas, and assessed point penetrability and durability. The results of this study will have implications for our understanding of prehistoric weaponry evolution.

In various geographic locations and time periods, human beings have been frequenting dark zones for ritual purposes. Regarding the unsuitable living conditions of dark zones, the following question arises: what drives humans to choose such places for practicing rituals? The answer to this question lies in the way human beings interact with dark cave environments. In this paper, I suggest that experiencing sensory deprivation, in particular lack of vision in dark zones, precipitates the enhancement of abstract and magical thinking. To verify this hypothesis, I employed the methods of cognitive scientists—namely, experimental research. I conducted an experiment using eye-tracking glasses to record participants’ eye-movement trajectories in darkness. The results indicated that eye-movement patterns during darkness resemble that of activities involving abstract and primary process thinking (aka magical thinking). Consequently, darkness provokes and facilitates magical thinking. Thus, I suggest that in addition to social and cultural incentives, darkness, as an environmental cue, sets the stage for human beings to associate dark zones of caves with supernatural powers and therefore choose to practice rituals in such locations.

Sessions were conducted in venues matching the era of clearest memories for participating older persons with dementia (PwD), e.g., 1940-ties apartment.  University researchers (Sweden, UK, & Denmark) evaluated the project. This presentation describes qualitative results.
The objective was to investigate if/how experiences of participating in reminiscence sessions held in open-air museum venues affected wellbeing in PwD. 
Method: PwD (n 129) were interviewed individually or in groups. Third-person perspectives were gathered from carers accompanying PwD (n 75), and session facilitators (n 24) using questionnaires that included space for free-text responses. Interviews and free-text responses were analyzed with content analysis. 
Results: Both museum venue and object handling stimulated PwD reminiscence. 
Evidence strongly indicates that PwD wellbeing (denoted e.g., by showing pleasure, humour, creative self-expression, interest, sustained attention, and a sense of connection with others) was generally promoted through participation in museum-based reminiscence sessions.
Conclusion: Museum-based reminiscence sessions were successful for enhancing PwD well-being at the time of the session. Further research is needed to explore and compare long-range effects of sessions.

This paper provides an example of the use of these methods of interpretation for the preservation of sites in Egypt. The current research took place in the Mallawi Museum in Minya, Egypt. This museum was looted in 2013 when people broke into the museum and stole and destroyed its objects. After the reopening of the museum in 2016, it was important to establish a community engagement project to assist the stakeholders in understanding the value of its cultural heritage sites. Intensive workshops were held in the museum to inform people about the significance of historical and archaeological sites in Minya by using several interpretative methods such as storytelling and living history. An assessment survey shows that this kind of project can make a significant impact in the effort to protect cultural heritage sites in the Middle East.","africa_egypt","","cultural_resources_heritage_management","public_community_archaeology","africa_egypt  cultural_resources_heritage_management public_community_archaeology",7

The cache of artefacts was a strange mixture of authentic ceramic figurines and vessels of a wide geographical provenience, none of which were from the Salasaca area.  In the absence of formal excavations, it is unclear how they were deposited there in the first place. 

The local community responded enthusiastically, seeing the artefacts as an important connection with their lost ancestral past. Some believed they were mitmakuna – peoples translocated by Inca conquerors in the 15th century from an alternative geographic location to replace rebellious tribes recently conquered. They had some oral traditions, but no ancestral connection with the land they had been brought to, suggesting this cache of artefacts filled a lacuna in their sense of cultural identity.

The purpose of this research is to demonstrate the utility of incorporating CRP into already established scene documentation protocols. To exhibit the process of outdoor scene documentation, three mock scenarios using faux human osteological material were created in a typical Central Florida pine flatwood environment: limited and large surface scatters, and a partial exhumation. Each scene was documented with a digital camera, both hand-held and mounted, as well as with and without ground control points. Overall, the 3D models constructed of the burial proved to be more conducive to CRP due to the uniformity of the ground surface. The models constructed of the ground surface scatters proved more difficult to create due to the complex nature of the ground surface vegetation.

However, the earliest evidence of agriculture dates to a later period (early PPNB, ca. 8750 BC, terminus post quem) or began further south (e.g., the Levant). We present a novel computational analysis of initial social complexity in these early Anatolian communities, based on Canonical Theory of politogenesis, evolutionary dynamics, and lines of evidence drawn from Göbekli Tepe and related Urfa sites. Theory and data are then used to create an agent-based model simulating the emergence of worship sites, other diffused cultural patterns, and the emergence of cultivation as may have occurred in the region during the PPNA and initial PPNB periods. The model is implemented in NetLogo. Along with other computational models of early social complexity, it aims to contribute to multidisciplinary understanding of prehistory, origins of civilization, and long-term culture change. Extensions of the model to other regions of politogenesis are also discussed.

We focus on two case studies from the Eastern Mediterranean (Turkey and Lebanon) which demonstrate that humans were selective in which sea turtle species they exploited. These multi-period case studies, in combination with published information about marine turtle exploitation in the region, also indicate long discontinuities in the archaeological record, which may be related to food avoidance.

With few exceptions, these events occurred late, during the Neolithic or later, with an implied assumption that most islands could not support hunters and gatherers.  We know that this scenario is no longer viable, with examples from Australia and southeastern Asia, such as Flores and Sulawesi, suggesting considerable antiquity extending prior to the emergence of both modern Homo sapiens and Neolithic economies.  In this presentation, I summarize some of the emerging data from the Mediterranean that suggests pre-Neolithic, and in some cases, pre-modern, seafaring to some of the islands.  Also addressed are the substantial problems of documenting and dating such sites.  Finally, I conclude with the implications of systematic seafaring in human evolution, especially as it relates to the considerable skills required for seafaring, such as long-term planning, adequate technology, navigation abilities, and, ultimately, “why” such activities would even be undertaken in the first place.  If pre-modern seafaring can be adequately documented, and shown to be systematic rather than random or one-time events, it indicates that these early humans had cognitive skills similar to fully modern people.","asia_southwest_asia_levant","paleolithic","","coastal_island_archaeology","asia_southwest_asia_levant paleolithic  coastal_island_archaeology",30

A spatial analysis of 45 depictions of short-statured individuals on archaeologically provenienced monuments reveals that the dwarf motif follows the trajectory of political power in the Maya lowlands, beginning within the Caracol-Calakmul polity and expanding with its reach. The dwarf motif appears at Tikal, in new stylistic configurations, upon its defeat of the Caracol-Calakmul alliance. Sites with flexible allegiances display the dwarf motif as a combination of local and regional stylistic elements. Evidence from small, dependent sites and regional superpowers reveals ancient Maya artists adapting broadly shared iconography to express locally the relationship between identity and power.

Based on the analysis, it is highly possible that the decrease of mobility is an adaptive response to the environment changes of early Holocene and is correlated with food resource intensification. In southern part of North China, the decrease of mobility and the transition towards the sedentary life stimulate the development of food production, while in northern part of North China such transition contributes to the establishment of intensified hunting-fishing-gathering economy.

Using this approach, specific consideration was given to a number of burials with destructive cranial lesions that may be evidence for the earliest known cases of treponemal disease in the North American Desert West. Additionally, deviant burials uncovered during past excavations were reconsidered for evidence of pathology only visible using archaeothanatological analyses. Analysis revealed new insights into the mortuary behavior of these early agriculturalists, particularly concerning corpse processing before primary inhumation as well as cultural understandings of sickness. This has implications regarding social organization and the array of observed burial patterns at La Playa, from cremation, single and multiple burials, and deviant burials.

Although iron ware was commodities commonly found in the Han period, this study identified several cross-regional patterns of variation in the assemblages of iron ware from tombs, which were shaped by both local production, expansion of the imperial market network, and core-periphery relationship.

Such stains typically are attributed to secondary mineralization of manganese oxides, however microanalysis revealed no evidence for manganese but instead identified crystals of pyrite within a thick red and black banded stain, identified as iron oxide and a ferric tannate complex respectively. Based upon multiple analytical methods, reaction mechanisms are proposed. This study debuts a novel sample preparation method for high-vacuum analysis of bone material, and demonstrates a cost-effective method to differentiate between damaging pyrite and other inert sulfur compounds in specimens. Results indicate that fossil coating types are extremely dependent upon the chemistry of the environment in which they are buried.

","Bronze Age","Digital Archaeology: GIS","Political Economy",TRUE,TRUE,"There is a recursive relationship between socio-economic institutions and the environment. Decisions about where to place settlements in a landscape were informed by existing economic institutions, but placement of sites in turn effected how social and economic institutions were organized. In this paper, I present a new GIS-based method for quantifying socio-economic organization and change in prehistoric societies. Catchment analyses, as employed in this study, define the availability of economic resources for individual settlements. This approach then quantifies cultural preferences across settlement systems. As a case study, I monitor settlement systems throughout the Early and Middle Bronze Age in southwest Transylvania. Southwest Transylvania is a major metal producing region that underwent significant socio-economic changes as metal became commodified throughout the European Bronze Age. Using catchment analysis, I demonstrate that communities in metal-rich landscapes increasingly prioritized access to agricultural land and access to interregional trade routes over metal ore sources. This result challenges existing narratives for how increasingly complex societies emerged in late prehistoric Europe. The method presented in this paper is easily transferable to other regional contexts and can be an additional tool for archaeologists exploring socio-economic organization and change in the past.","europe_eastern_europe","bronze_age","digital_archaeology_gis","political_economy","europe_eastern_europe bronze_age digital_archaeology_gis political_economy",37

However, there are many contexts where qualitative data (such as oral historical accounts) can provide valuable information on meaning and personal significance.

The research discussed here addresses the lifeways of enslaved individuals on the Dutch Caribbean islands of St Eustatius, St Maarten and Curaçao. It incorporates data from material culture, oral history, and osteology into a thematic analysis. Often used in the social sciences, this approach allows diverse datasets to be combined through their organisation into ‘themes’. Through this, the researcher gains an impression of the information that is meaningful and important for descriptive purposes.
The author encourages archaeologists to consider qualitative data in their own research, especially the utilisation of oral history interviews which promote community involvement and contribute to the decolonisation of the discipline.

","Bronze Age","Mortuary Analysis","Mortuary Archaeology",FALSE,TRUE,"Mortuary variability in European prehistory has long been perceived through the lens of Christian worldview from which the discipline of archaeology originally developed. Expectations rooted in this conceptual perspective inevitably shaped the ways how the archaeological record was approached and interpreted. As a case study we consider the Central European Bronze Age, on which we can deconstruct the traditional ‘textbook’ understanding of ancient funerary traditions. During this period, general development observed in formal cemeteries is characterised by the gradual shift from prevailing inhumation towards cremation, but with strikingly frequent finds of complete, partial, or disarticulated human skeletons in settlement pits and ditches.  We argue that what is usually regarded as a normative burial, or its opposite, i.e. seemingly careless and non-ritual deposition of human remains, may be a very problematic categorization. Gradually accumulated evidence suggests that the most visible forms of human burial in the archaeological record may not have been the dominant type of treatment of the dead. According to our research, secondary manipulation and fragmentation of human bodies, which was turning them into objects of cultural patrimony that could be shared and curated, seems to have been the most frequent destiny awaiting the deceased.","europe_eastern_europe","bronze_age","mortuary_analysis","mortuary_archaeology","europe_eastern_europe bronze_age mortuary_analysis mortuary_archaeology",28

","Other","Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology","Household Archaeology",TRUE,TRUE,"In the context of Africa, foodways are usually portrayed very differently than in the archaeology of food literature. Food in West Africa is depicted by its primary historians as shrouded in continuous food insecurities and largely lacking differentiated cuisines. However, recent archaeological and historical research in Atlantic era West African foodways have highlighted the dynamic nature of West African foodways. Despite these advancement, the full processes through which American crops became integrated into local African foodways is poorly understood. This paper critically reviews how Africanist researchers have discussed the incorporation of American crops into local foodways. Building on these works, I show how we can trace the impacts of local food choices on the broader Atlantic trade through my proposed ethno-archaeological research in Ghana-Amedeka. This paper situates these issues within the Atlantic era in West Africa. The Atlantic trade brought with it networks of connections and change, however these interactions did not happen in vacuum. They occurred within local situated social, political, economic, and historical contexts. I argue throughout this paper that the silence on these local social processes that shaped the contours of the Atlantic trade portray the multidirectional relationship that characterized the trade as unidirectional.","africa_sub_saharan_africa","","ethnography_ethnoarchaeology","household_archaeology","africa_sub_saharan_africa  ethnography_ethnoarchaeology household_archaeology",39

The earliest evidence for this is the heat treatment of silcrete 164 ka at the Middle Stone Age site Pinnacle Point 13B in South Africa.  Heating stone prior to knapping alters the physical and chemical composition of the stone, and it has long been recognized that flaked heat-treated stone has a glossier surface.  We expect this glossiness to result from a smoother flaked surface.  Thus, we investigated whether surface roughness, as measured by a 3D microscope, can be used as a proxy to identify the presence of heat treatment in the archaeological record.  The results of our unpublished pilot study suggested roughness parameters differ significantly between untreated and treated silcrete.  In the present study, we record values for multiple surface texture parameters on a sample of experimentally created stone tools from paired heat-treated and untreated silcrete nodules.  A Bayesian probability model, trained on the experimental sample, was then used to evaluate the probability individual artifacts have undergone heat treatment.

These artifacts, which include Middle Formative picks, figural celts, clamshell and plaque pendants, and objects designated as “spoons,” were likely used by elites as both functional objects and high-status adornment, as illustrated in the contemporary sculpture. Most examples of these artifacts are found in caches and graves of distant and/or later civilizations, apparently after they had experienced long use-lives; while still identifiable, most are extensively reworked and could no longer function as tools, becoming primarily symbolic—or their symbolism had been co-opted and transformed through recarving and recycling. Analysis of the few examples found in Formative period graves reveals considerable use-wear and breakage, re-sharpening, and reshaping; some were reworked to the point where they are barely recognizable, apparently retired only after they were largely unidentifiable. Such find contexts suggest that these artifacts functioned as inalienable goods—revered, elite possessions that were reserved, inherited, and treasured as symbols of association and status.

During the excavation of the tomb, Carter also claimed to have identified two distinct robberies that most likely occurred with a few years of the initial interment. Other scholars have debated this assertion. A spatial analysis of the Valley the Kings will provide insight into this debate. This paper will investigate the possible routes ancient robbers may have taken while escaping from the tomb of Tutankhamun through the utilization of Geographical Information System (GIS) analyses including viewshed and least cost pathways. The most efficient route out of the valley will determine if Carter’s initial claim of finding dropped artifacts from the tomb was in correct or not.

In the last few years, tremendous success has been achieved in image recognition through deep learning, a category of supervised machine learning which is based on hierarchical representation learning. We have chosen to examine the application of deep convolutional neural networks for automated archaeological detection focusing on qanats. The methodological merit of the project is that qanat shafts are one of the most suitable archaeological features for pattern recognition. The analytical merit is that conducting comparative studies of qanat systems at a regional scale is predicated on mapping massive number of qanat shafts, which is impossible manually.

Chief among these is the use of the millions of images generated by space agencies showing life onboard the station. We will classify the associations between objects, spaces, and crewmembers by cataloguing them from the images into a database, indexing them for time using the images’ metadata. The enormous number of images makes classification by human researchers time- and cost-prohibitive. We are exploiting recent advances in machine-learning algorithms and crowdsourcing for classification of non-machine-readable data to solve this problem.
Ultimately, we will be able to choose any moment and study the station’s development and occupation. We can then map changes in the function of spaces, or the associations of people and objects with particular spaces, over time.

Research in the middle Rio Grande valley of New Mexico documents a 4,000-year long record from 3000 BC to AD 900. Archaic period structures, dated 3000 BC to about AD 250, display little change in form, size, and construction details. Settlement pattern changes appear with the first midden deposits and increased numbers of dwellings with associated storage features. Constructed milling features for processing wild seed appear before the adoption of cultigens.

Long-term architectural and technological stability gave way to rapid change coinciding with the appearance of agricultural domesticates after AD 500. Multi-dwelling  sites and architectural investments indicate decreased residential mobility. Simultaneously, distinctions in functionally specific domestic spaces appear with the separation of cooking areas from sleeping spaces. Sweeping changes occur in subsistence technology: groundstone reflects the shift from a seed-based diet to a corn-based diet. Cooking features changed from rock-lined pits to formalized hearths. Domesticated corn required ceramics for cooking; size, shape, and location of storage features also changed rapidly. Implications for cultural continuity and in-place population growth are discussed in light of these long-term trends.

While research pursued in the dTFA framework has gained momentum over the intervening decades, questions regarding its reliability if not legitimacy have also emerged. Arguably, this critical pushback is the result of the tacit but persistent reluctance both of advocates and critics to give full formal expression to dTFA’s core theory. In turn, this reluctance has led to the inadvertent conflation of the program’s foundational principles and its special-case conditions, as well as to vague impressions regarding the degree to which non-demographic forces obscure demographic information in tfds. In response, I explicitly formalize Rick’s framework as a functional decomposition of the tfd DGP.

We consider the co-evolution of local landscapes, translocated arborescent flora, and Marquesan societies.","pacific_islands","","paleoethnobotany","subsistence_foodways","pacific_islands  paleoethnobotany subsistence_foodways",48

Therefore, it is essential to retrieve as much information as possible from assemblages that favour their preservation. One of the most time- and cost-efficient methods of objectively achieving faunal identity in ancient bone is collagen fingerprinting technique ‘ZooMS’ (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry). ZooMS harnesses the potential of preserved collagen, the most dominant and time-stable protein in bone, to generate peptide mass spectra that are diagnostic of faunal identity. Here, ZooMS is applied to 116 fish bone samples from a ~5000 year old assemblage from the Šventoji region of Lithuania to deduce species identity and construct assemblage compositions. Identifications from ZooMS analysis uncovered incorrect morphological identifications in 14% of the fish samples analysed. Furthermore, through the analysis of over twenty different species, we demonstrate the ability to distinguish between closely diverged members of the Salmo spp. (salmon) and Scophthalmus spp. (turbot) genera; some of the taxa most frequently misidentified in this assemblage. This research highlights the great potential for applying ZooMS to archaeological fish remains that are otherwise often left unidentified.","europe_northern_europe","neolithic","zooarchaeology","","europe_northern_europe neolithic zooarchaeology",37

Presented here is a continuation of this work, with new faunal analyses incorporated from recently excavated inland, western, and earlier (Saladoid) sites, as well as faunal data from a few past reports that were recently discovered. Currently, the data indicate differences between assemblages from the previously examined coastal Troumassoid sites and the recently included inland occupations. A difference was also identified between all Troumassoid sites and the earlier Saladoid settlements. Comparison of the faunal assemblages not only helps to enhance our understanding of Grenada’s prehistoric environments, but also the communities that interacted with them. The differences between sites reveal local variations in subsistence strategies over time and further corroborate the transition to an expanded diet during the Troumassoid period.

This presentation explores that cosmological salience through the recent excavations at Tutu Uitz Na, a large intermediate elite residential and ceremonial group situated in the Belize Valley, in the hinterland of the Late-Terminal Classic (AD 700-900) polity of Lower Dover. Tutu Uitz Na rose earlier, during the Middle Preclassic (1000-400 BC). The initial founding of the group saw the placement of a consecratory ritual deposit of artifacts associated with the watery underworld: figurines, marine shell, and an estimated 26 million river snails, all laid beneath the plaza. Excavations at a nearby commoner patio group have revealed a similar Middle Preclassic deposit beneath the patio. This paper explores the importance of this deposit and seeks to situate it within other case studies from Mesoamerica, to establish a distinct pattern of intent on the part of the ancient Maya.","mesoamerica_maya_lowlands","maya_preclassic","","ritual_symbolism","mesoamerica_maya_lowlands maya_preclassic  ritual_symbolism",19

In the literature, they are most frequently addressed as examples of art for the regions in which they are found, but rarely as pan-North American phenomena. A solely regional perspective implies that they only had local audiences. Human figures and disembodied parts are rarely examined, or compared/contrasted with reference to wider geographic regions as potentially having had diverse and travelling audiences. This regionalism has developed despite Omaha self-identification as having relocated several times, and the patchwork distribution of linguistic groups across North America for example, speakers of Siouan languages are found in both the Great Plains and South East.

The exposure and subsequent disappearance of material culture is seldom accompanied by systematic archaeological recording. As a result, a wide range of past activities associated with the coast remain unrecorded, their context poorly understood and our understanding of past human interaction at local, regional and inter-regional scales impaired.

This paper aids in complicating these views by emphasizing how recent understandings of network theory and materiality shift the portrait of complexity from one of linear progression to one of social disconnection. More specifically, this paper explores how current ideas of materiality inherently flip our value system for how societies may be complex – so that bigger is not necessarily better, but the result of peoples attempts to deal with isolation, alienation, disconnection, and sometimes social instability. A case study on the construction of the Aksumite funerary monuments (50-400 AD) in ancient Ethiopia will be used to illustrate the two approaches.","africa_eastern_horn","iron_age","mortuary_analysis","monumentality","africa_eastern_horn iron_age mortuary_analysis monumentality",39

Las tratamos como los instrumentos y los testigos de la relación entre los poderes divinos y los hombres, que dan cuenta de la manera en que estos últimos concebían el cielo.
Proponemos una lectura interpretativa sobre los espacios simbólicos estelares, articulada en torno a los sistemas de significados que son los elementos formales de las tipologías, los temas figurativos y la iconografía estelar que se contextualizan mutuamente.

Relatively little is known about WBT human-plant interaction as compared to their maize-bean-squash cultivating Iroquoian neighbors. Culture-historical models of the WBT are proving to be outdated, overemphasizing the supposed difference between WBT ‘hunter-gatherer’ subsistence strategies and Iroquoian farming. Recent isotopic analyses have suggested archaeologists have been underestimating the amount of maize consumed among the WBT peoples at this time, and limited excavation and botanical analysis has hindered the revision of our understanding of their subsistence practices. Plant remains from the Arkona Cluster sites, however, show WBT peoples were indeed cultivating maize, calling into question our conceptualization of their food production, landscape construction, and mobility. Paleoethnobotanical methods were employed to elucidate plant-human interaction of these culturally-distinct peoples residing at the periphery of Iroquoian territory and influence. This paper will present macrobotanical data from flotation sampling, as well as micro-fossil (starch grain) data from ceramic and groundstone residues to provide more meaningful cross-cultural comparisons of food production during the early Late Woodland period in Ontario.

Therefore, most of these collections were not or no longer accessible to scientists. Faced with this question concerning the heritage preservation, different regional actors invested in anthropological research argued on the best way to improve this situation. It was decided to create the “human bone library of PACA region”. Today, the “human bone library” is part of the regional archeological deposit of the French Ministry of Culture and Communication in charge of curating archeological material. The “human bone library” comprises close to about 6000 subjects overall dating from the Neolithic to the Modern period. Now, with a little perspective, we can confirm that this “human bone library” is starting to impact anthropological research and valorises the collections on regional and national levels. 
Besides presenting the “human bone library”, this talk aims to highlight the conditions of the collections and of anthropological research in Southern France before and after this scientific management tool was implemented.

The Neo-Assyrian empire is known as one of the major empires in the Ancient Near East. Ruling in Mesopotamia during the Iron Age, they had a well-organized agricultural system. In this paper, I will utilize phytolith analyses to investigate the impact of the Neo-Assyrian empire on agriculture and land-use. I will compare the elite-controlled agriculture with the crop choices of peasant farmers. It’s likely that the peasant farmers would have choosen more resistant and reliable types of plants for their own food which would reduce the risks of unexpected natural disasters such as droughts and floods. In order to conduct this research, I use phytolith data from Iraqi Kurdistan, at on-going excavations of Assyrian-period sites in the Peshdar Plain, including two main sites: Gird-l Bazar and Qalat-l Dinka, directed by Professor Karen Radner, University of Munich. These two sites are very promising for this research. Gird-l Bazar is a non-elite farming and production village, and Qalat-l Dinka is an administrative center being sustained by Gird-l Bazar. Thus, the two will cover the empire’s impact on agriculture and the farmers’ choices in cultivation and production.

This preoccupation with subsistence has often led to formulations of indigenous lifeways as pure response to environmental conditions. Most notably, the idea that prehistoric bone grease processing was a response to resource stress is a topic of vigorous discussion. 
Archaeological studies of bone grease processing have mostly overlooked its other uses. For instance, bone grease was commonly mixed with ocher, charcoal, and other minerals to make grease paint for decorative, ritual and medicinal uses. Our review of ethnohistoric literature coupled with archaeological data from sites in Texas shows a strong correlation between pigment minerals and bone grease processing. This has important implications for how bone grease processing locales are understood, indicating that the rendering of grease had a function in social life that went well beyond subsistence.

Among them, the scarlet macaw (Ara macao) provided bright red, blue and yellow feathers that were traded to the Central Mexican Highlands and, beyond Mesoamerica, until the American Southwest. As suggested by ethnohistoric records, some birds may have been maintained in captivity and harvested to supply the demand in feathers. In spite of  examples of large-scale macaw management in the American Southwest, there is no such archaeological evidence for Mesoamerica, and in particular within their native  regions.
In this presentation, we investigate the osseous remains of two scarlet macaws from the Postclassic site of Vista Hermosa, Southern Tamaulipas, Mexico (1300-1500 AD) to clarify their relationship with the Huastecan population. Using osteological markers and stable isotopes, we show that the birds were kept in captivity, maybe as pets. By identifying captive birds outside of the major political centres of Central Mexico, these results shed new light on aviculturist practices in ancient Mesoamerica. In addition, the archaeological evidence of captive macaws in the Huasteca is consistent with ethnohistoric observations, and could help to understand the origin of the captive-reared scarlet macaws found in the American Southwest.","mesoamerica_gulf_coast","highland_mesoamerica_postclassic","zooarchaeology","subsistence_foodways_domestication","mesoamerica_gulf_coast highland_mesoamerica_postclassic zooarchaeology subsistence_foodways_domestication",48

Comparison of scan data is straight forward and is very similar to quality control and inspection processes in industrial applications. Initial analysis was performed on older scan data. In addition, a high-resolution fringe projection scanner was employed to scan further head vases in museums in Germany and Italy. Scan resolution and accuracy of approximately 0.1 mm in all dimensions were required to reveal differences below 1 mm. Shape analysis results of the head areas confirm that it is likely that the same mould was used for shaping some of the head vases.

Intersecting with their economic uses, they were also important socially, politically and ritually. It is relatively straightforward to determine the proportional representation and mortality profiles of the major species – cattle, sheep/goat and pig. While this provides insights into how and why animals were managed, it does not allow the detailed investigation of how individual animals were actually kept, how they were moved around the landscape, and how various nearby communities integrated their animal management practices. Isotopic approaches can offer insights into just these practices. We report the results of a multi-isotope study Early/Middle Iron Age domestic fauna (cattle, sheep/goat and pig) within a very constrained study area of the Oxfordshire Ridgeway, south-central England. Strontium isotope measurements on dental enamel provide evidence primarily for the mobility of cattle, while bone collagen stable nitrogen isotopes suggest separate herds and flocks.

A third option is that the city’s collective government begun as a fully decentralized network of neighborhood representatives, but this kind of arrangement seems susceptible to the problems of cooperation and action coordination. Previously we used a computational model to show that in principle this latter worry is unfounded, as long as we assume that the network’s topology could be transformed via community rituals and was not strongly subdivided (Froese, Gershenson, and Manzanilla 2014).

AD950. As a fisher-gatherer-hunter society, they heavily exploited the shellfish and finfish resources of the estuary. During this time, Estero Bay’s estuarine ecology and coastal geomorphology developed in response to variable rates of sea-level rise (SLR) and climate change. Our work integrates archaeological and geological perspectives on this intertwined history of the Calusa and their environment. Specifically, we found correlations between shifts in estuarine salinity of the bay, as it closed, and the types of shellfish exploited by its inhabitants. As salinity lowered in the bay, favoring oyster reef productivity, the Calusa shifted away from more marine-based shellfish and to more heavily exploit oyster resources for surplus production. Concomitant with these shifts were changes in site organization and layout, which included construction and alteration of new landforms and features (e.g., canals and mounds). Estuarine conditions today are comparable to those in Calusa’s later history, but SLR acceleration threatens a shift back to the earlier estuarine ecology and geomorphology. Consequently, Calusa’s historical ecology provides insights for future environmental management of the bay.","north_america_southeast_united_states","woodland","geoarchaeology","environment_climate","north_america_southeast_united_states woodland geoarchaeology environment_climate",23

","Other","Lithic Analysis","Caves and Rockshelters",TRUE,FALSE,"Lithic miniaturization, the systematic production of small stone artifacts by controlled fracture, was a pervasive feature of late Pleistocene lithic technology. Smaller toolkits enabled humans to exploit raw materials more efficiently, to produce composite tools more effectively, to reduce a wider range of rocks, and to increase mobility by lightening toolkits. These benefits allowed humans to occupy a wider range of ecological niches. Archaeologists working in southern Africa have long acknowledged lithic miniaturization’s importance in framing the region’s late Pleistocene prehistory. However, to date archaeologists have conducted very little inter-region comparative research on the topic. This paper presents the results of a comparative lithic technological study between Klipfonteinrand and Sehonghong- two large rock-shelters located in southern Africa’s winter and summer rainfall zones respectively. Evidence from these sites shows not only a comparative technological approach’s effectiveness but also that lithic miniaturization expresses itself differently in different regions. Patterned variability of this nature fits a model of strategic behavioral variability. To gauge variability in prehistoric lithic miniaturization, archaeologists need to adopt more contextual and comparative methods of stone tool analysis.

One driver may be what is known in ecology as an Allee effect, a positive relationship between population density and per capita utility. Allee effects may emerge with economies of scale such as those created by some forms of intensified food acquisition and production. Thus, in an Allee-like setting, individuals belonging to larger groups enjoy the benefits of greater efficiency and productivity of subsistence, as well as group defense, mating opportunities, cooperative parenting, etc. Here we evaluate this hypothesis by examining the process of initial plant domestication in Eastern North America, where we expect the process of intensification should co-occur with a shift from more dispersed to more clustered settlement patterns as individuals begin to benefit from aggregation. Application of the Clark-Evans Nearest Neighbor Index to dated site locations available from the Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database support our predictions, revealing a shift from dispersed to clustered settlements that coincides with the initial domestication of plants in the region. This result supports the hypothesis that subsistence intensification in Holocene Eastern North America was associated with Allee effects and incipient territoriality.","north_america","archaic","digital_archaeology_gis","settlement_patterns","north_america archaic digital_archaeology_gis settlement_patterns",12

This paper explains this seeming contradiction from the perspective of broader geopolitical dynamics, particularly the rivalry between Calakmul and Tikal. Unlinke other centers in Uxte’tuun, the dynastic history of Oxpemul is silent during the height of the Kaanul (Snake) Dynasty during the ‘Three Kings Period’ (AD 635-730), when Calakmul exerted direct rulership over subordinate kingdoms in Uxte’tuun. This could reflect either stagnation and decline, or a later rewriting of history following major political upheaval in the region. Following the decline of the Snake Dynasty, Oxpmeul undertook a major campaign of monument construction, with kings holding both the local ‘stone throne’ and the enigmatic ‘bat head’ emblem glyph. These data indicate that Oxpemul benefitted from the decline of its more powerful neighbor and rose to regional preeminence under the aegis of Tikal.

Analysis of human skeletal remains in their mortuary context has the potential to challenge this assumption and inform more nuanced understandings of gender and social status. Individuals (n=285) at the EBA Maros cemetery at Ostojicevo, Serbia (ca. 1900-1500 B.C.E.) exhibit a strong correlation between biological sex and funerary treatment, specifically body orientation. Among the subset of adult (>18 years-at-death) biological males buried in a “female” orientation, several stand out for either their unique physical characteristics (e.g., tall stature, robusticity), or association with “female” prestige offerings (e.g., copper pins, beaded sashes). The relationship between “masculinity” and social status is further complicated by gendered differences in the social perception and embodiment of physical trauma. While there is an association between trauma, male orientation, and weaponry, most individuals with skeletal evidence of antemortem or perimortem trauma did not receive special funerary treatment. Through the examination of multiple lines of evidence, including grave goods, orientation, and evidence of trauma, this paper argues that transgenderism seems to have been as highly regarded as other elements of traditional “masculine” identities at Ostojicevo.","europe_eastern_europe","bronze_age","bioarchaeology_skeletal_analysis","gender_childhood","europe_eastern_europe bronze_age bioarchaeology_skeletal_analysis gender_childhood",28

These uses of Spondylus shells appear to be constant from the Early Classic to the Late Classic period. The lack of information from the Postclassic period, hinders conclusions regarding the commerce of Spondylus shells during this time. The two species of Spondylus analyzed in this work are found in the Pacific Coast, from California down to Ecuador. Defining the chronology of the Spondylus, chain of production, and the frequency of acquisition offers an opportunity to add new data on economic, and political interaction between Copan and others neighboring settlements in the Maya and non-Maya area.","mesoamerica","maya_classic","archaeometry__materials_analysis","craft_production","mesoamerica maya_classic archaeometry__materials_analysis craft_production",41

Meanwhile, coil breaks were not recorded on  cordmarked sherds indicating a manufacturing technique based on fusing slabs of clay utilizing a cord wrapped paddle and anvil.  The Richter site data indicate that surface finish results from  variable manufacturing techniques, and may not be strictly decorative in nature.

Because monumental architecture benefited from the labor of non-elites, the purposeful placement of the incised designs strongly suggests a system of messaging in their invisibility.

However, there is reason to be cautious about this assessment. While several recent studies have shown correlations between increased temperatures and conflict on the time-scale of years to decades, correlations over such short-term timescales may be misleading. The effects of anthropogenic climate change will likely go on for centuries and we know that long-term effects can be substantially different from short-term ones. Therefore, it is important that we investigate the century-scale effects of increasing temperature on conflict levels. With this in mind, we analyzed three long-term historical conflict records—one from the Classic Maya region, one from Europe, and one from China, each spanning multiple centuries. Using a recently developed time-series regression method, we compared each conflict record to several regional temperature reconstructions. We found clear evidence for a positive relationship in the Classic Maya case, but our results were more complicated for the other two cases. Thus, while changes in temperature can sometimes lead to changes in conflict levels, they do not always do so. In some cases, the relationship between temperature and conflict is mediated by social, historical, and/or environmental factors.","multi_regional_comparative","","","environment_climate","multi_regional_comparative   environment_climate",47

As opposed to traditional scholarship that holds primary interest in inscriptions engraved on these bones, I consider late Shang divination in entirety as a technological process that proceeds from the preparation and delivery of bone material via tributary networks all the way to bones’ after-use discard into pits. By switching the attention to the least examined pre-divination and post-divination stages, I focus on the texts of marginal inscriptions, the data of the used turtle plastrons and the records of stratigraphy recovered from Pit YH127 and Pit H3 at Yinxu. I argue that since regional tribute payers, capital scribes and diviners were made bound by the tributary networks of oracle turtles, their major behavioral patterns that aimed to facilitate the provision of turtle shells for divination would have been “recorded” by the altered materiality of the shells at each step of change. To detect and reconstruct such behavioral patterns and the physicality of divination can deepen our understandings of the groups that attended the industry of oracle bones, and thus the nature of oracle bones as well.

Nevertheless, residents of Achiutla did indeed have access to European glazed wares, and used tin-enameled majolicas with considerable frequency, in particular. I attribute this pattern to indigenous nobles having served as primary interlocutors between Spanish authorities and their broader native constituencies following the social upheaval of the Conquest. As such, they would have negotiated with and attempted to appease the demands of both of these different groups simultaneously. I suggest that the ceramic patterning indicates they did so in part through commensal politics, entertaining these various groups at feasting events.

In this paper we present the preliminary results of our field season this past summer in the Cerro Coyotepetl neighborhood of Tepeticpac, a señorío of Tlaxcallan. Archaeological prospection methods and remote sensing included magnetometry, electrical resistivity and photogrammetry by drone.

In some instances, authors cite little but their own research. This raises the question whether statistical analysis of basketry attributes can be used to identify a basket’s ethnic origin.
 To answer this question, baskets of selected northeastern California Native American groups, will be statistically compared to test whether ethnic origin is indicated in the results, and whether linguistic affiliation or geographic propinquity best account for differences and similarities between basket weavers. The analysis will include sixty-five different basketry attributes from each of one hundred fifty to two hundred individual baskets. The potential for seeing previously unknown associations between ethnic groups is likely. Newly recognized associations have the potential to influence future research on population migration, genetic studies, and linguistics.

Scholars have advanced a wide range of theories explaining the underlying motivations and purposes of these abundant and regulated ritual massacres. As an extension of recent efforts that examine ancient Aztec sacrifice as a multi-faceted and complex system, this paper utilizes a phenomenological approach to examine the “experience” of sacrificial rituals. Using modern bio-social-psychological theory, this paper reveals that the brutal treatment of captive enemy bodies in human sacrificial rituals provided physiological, psychological, and social rewards that turned these spectacular events into a form of enthralling entertainment. Several other recompenses for officiants and other spectator-participants included a sense of security, management of anxiety, and social bonding. In addition, this paper reveals that these ceremonies incorporated different shamanic elements that fostered communally experienced “altered states of consciousness” which further contributed to physiological rewards, the reduction of social anxieties, and an increase in social solidarity. The significance of this investigation is that it offers additional explanations for the massive scale and longevity of the practice of human sacrifice amongst the ancient Aztec.

However, this did not end slavery itself in Africa. Intensification of cash-crop agriculture on the West African coast by the Danish colonists provoked an upsurge in the local slave trade. As the Danish plantation economy solidified, increasing numbers of enslaved people were engaged to labour in these plantations in Ghana. The research examines the documentary and the archaeological data of one of the earliest Danish plantations (Frederikssted plantation) established in 1794 in Dodowa, in Ghana. 
Frederikssted and other Danish plantations are part of the building blocks of long-term cultural contact spanning almost two centuries (1658-1850) between Denmark and Ghana, and they offer this research the opportunity to gauge the   continuities and discontinuities in contemporary. The excavations and the resultant material culture reveal that Frederikssted plantation site represents different episodes of occupation, abandonment, and reoccupation. Indigenous local elites who reoccupied the plantation (after its collapse in 1802) have play a crucial role in shaping the plantation landscape, which provides a new way to understand plantation archaeology in general.

Thermal influences on marine shell are poorly understood across all disciplines, including archaeology. Burning or heating may not always show any visual signs and rather can only be identified through erroneous results when dating or chemical analyses have been undertaken. Recent studies have begun to explore changes in structural and chemical aspects between varying burning/heating methods and durations, however, these studies only focus on a few shell species from the Mediterranean and fail to factor in overall microstructural differences between shell species.
Therefore, to better understand the processes of burning/heating on shell in tropical sites of Australasia an experimental study was undertaken. Six tropical marine shell species with varying microstructures were chosen to undergo three methods of burning/heating. These samples were then examined under Dinolite, SEM as well as under-going XRD analysis. Results show distinct differences between the various microstructures, both visually and chemically.

Case studies in the Upper Paleolithic of East Asia also revealed variabilities from end-scrapers whose functions seem to be relatively consistent as hide working tools, to burins which exhibit diversified usage, as well as projectile points whose functions are less evident from traceological data. A more theoretical approach to use-wear is proposed here for understanding complex diversity of tool function. The concept of “technological organization” (by Binford) combined with settlement patterns along a river basin, is applied to traceological research in the Paleolithic of northeastern part of the Japanese archipelago. The Mogami River archaeological project and standardized experimental program of Tohoku University team provide concrete data bases of this methodological discussion.

The horned clay figurine emerging from a podium, a table-like or a low roundish stand appears to have replaced the rather well known “goddess figurines” of South East Europe. These figurines depict the female upper body emerging from a lower part that is often called “house models” or “altars”. In our case, the emerging body is not human, but apparently that of cattle. 
   Generally, all horned bovid representations are regarded as bull figurines, representing the male procreative power. The one presented here has a realistic relief of a female genital organ, must be a depiction of a cow. I shall focus on this apparent bias in archaeological literature, which unfolds data about the early cattle husbandry and milking, explaining the appearance of cow representations in early farming communities.

By combining the surprisingly vast collection of Greek and Latin references to ancient beers, the archaeobotanical remains from individual settlements and cultures, broader archaeological and artistic evidence, and complementary food and wine preparations, I have produced several complete beers, individual components of beer (e.g. malts), adjunct-beer combinations, and brewing techniques. With this experimental archaeology, I demonstrate the diversity of research questions that can be addressed, especially those related to the dissemination of technological knowledge, ancient diet, agriculture, and feasting.

Experimental work, various levels of student skills, timelines, and laboratory space set-up were used to create a series of potential parameters that can be replicated in lab, classroom, and garage settings, to increase the likelihood of successful data collection. Two Late Prehistoric sites from the Great Lakes region are used to track the success rates in different settings for novice and experienced student researchers’ abilities to learn and distinguish cut marks on fish bone.

These concurrent influences on human d2H-collagen values were examined in 11 North American archaeological sites.  The d2H-collagen values were compared to bone hydroxyapatite oxygen isotopes (i.e. d18O-HAP) and bone collagen nitrogen isotopes (i.e. d15N-collagen), which are proxies for meteoric water influence and amount of consumed protein, respectively.  Pooled site data yield moderate correlation between d2H-collagen and d18O-HAP and moderate correlation between d2H-collagen and d15N-collagen.  Conversion of d2H-collagen and d18O-HAP to meteoric water values yielded a similarly moderate correlation with a d2H/d18O slope below 8, the expected value observed in meteoric water.  Conversion to theoretical hydrogen isotope values free of trophic level influences resulted in a weak correlation with d15N-collagen, suggesting that direct trophic level enrichment/depletion is not controlling the disparity between expected and measured values.  The deviations are hypothetically caused by non-local food sources and a decoupling of expected d2H/d18O relationships as individuals consumed more meat and decreased in vivo non-essential amino acid production.","north_america","historic","bioarchaeology_skeletal_analysis","","north_america historic bioarchaeology_skeletal_analysis",20

Hence, a research on non-massive cities, “from the bottom up,” is crucial to understand the development of ancient Maya urbanism. Investigations at the archaeological sites of Chan Chich, in northwestern Belize, and Kiuic, in the Puuc zone of the Yucatán Peninsula, have recovered evidence of emerging and established monumental precincts during the early Middle Preclassic and Late Classic period, respectively.

However, archaeological fragments of tortoiseshell or artefacts have degraded, so that often the material has lost its recognizable tortoiseshell pattern, making identification to species difficult. 
The carapace and plastron of sea turtles are covered with keratinous scutes mainly composed of beta-keratins, a category of structural proteins that stack together to produce ß-pleated sheet structures. Here, reference materials from five species of marine turtles were characterized by proteomics analysis to build a database of beta-keratin sequences and determine robust markers for species identification. Preliminary data have shown significant differences between hawksbill and green turtles, allowing distinction of these species in ancient materials. In addition, comb fragments from archaeological sites and workshops in France were examined.

Consequently, performing complex analyses on satellite data can be computationally intensive to a prohibitive degree. Google Earth Engine (GEE), an in-development, cloud-based platform for visualizing/analyzing satellite imagery, affords a solution for researchers with limited access to computational processing power (Gorelick et al. 2017). GEE is freely accessible through a web browser, but analysis is completed on Google’s cyber-infrastructure, facilitating rapid analyses on any scale (including planetary). Moreover, through the GEE platform, users can create custom scripts to suit their specific research questions and needs. This paper explores potential contributions of GEE to archaeological research through two case studies. First, GEE was used to automatically identify specific archaeological features across the Faynan region of Southern Jordan. Second, GEE-based edge-detection and automatic vectorization was tested for mapping archaeological sites at the Iron Age (ca. 1200–900 BCE) site of Khirbat al-Jariya in Faynan. Through these trials, GEE proved a viable tool for archaeological research with significant potential to supplement traditional forms of archaeological survey and mapping.

Drawing inspiration from the work of Ingold, I seek to find the middle ground of phenomenology, ecology, and materiality in describing how humans dwell and make their worlds among the various other communities around them. In the Lower Suwannee River Valley, Florida human and oyster communities have interacted and intersected with another for millennia. Like people, oysters dwell and build creating their Umwelt, a concept introduced by Von Uexküll. This resulted in communities numbering in the millions. When the Umwelten of oysters and people are juxtaposed, it is argued that oysters ‘anchored’ people differentially throughout the history of the region. These oyster communities are argued to represent Heideggarian Buildings, as they are locations which make sites for several coastal Umwelten, people included. Prior to 1500 BC, human communities relocated their dead to keep pace with the rising sea, emplacing oyster shell midden during the process. After an occupational hiatus, changes in human building and dwelling post 750 BC were a direct result of inhabiting an area already full of history, including past interactions with oyster beds. Florida Gulf Coast peoples in the Lower Suwannee in many ways defined themselves through relationships with the oyster communities they interacted with.

Sex is not included in this analysis and thus, the MCA groups graves without assuming a binary construction of sex. Instead, sex information is only used in the interpretation phase of the analysis. Our MCA confirms that Chiribaya graves are differentiated by gender based on funerary objects but shows greater variation in the graves of females in comparison to males, suggesting that women’s gendered activities were more variable than those of men. Furthermore, the overlap in the graves of males and females suggests that these gender categories are not binary opposites, and thus we suggest an alternative system for conceptualizing gender identity in the Chiribaya polity.

While it was also thought possible to have small amounts of obsidian from the further away tiny island of Palmarola, only Lipari obsidian was present in the ~50 artifacts chemically analyzed.

Since then, extensive geological study of Lipari and the other Mediterranean obsidian sources has been conducted, while in the last ten years thousands of obsidian artifacts have been tested using non-destructive, portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometers. Specifically, about 2400 obsidian artifacts from the regions of Calabria, Basilicata, and Campania were analyzed from 2014-2017.

Examination by high-resolution microanalysis (SEM-EDS, TEM, FTIR, micro-Raman) has revealed evidence pertaining to source selection of the iron-oxides used to produce the pictographs, the weathering and condition of the panels, and potential evidence for pigment enhancement by pyrotechnology. The pictographs at Boling Point were painted on an outcrop of argillaceous limestone covered in a kaolinitic weathering deposit. This natural canvas, and subsequent accretionary deposition, has aided in the long-term preservation of the panel. The pigment is composed of a homogenized mixture of ferrihydrite and hematite that was biogenically produced ex situ, most likely in a spring deposit, by aquatic iron-oxide producing bacteria, including Leptothrix ochracea and Gallionella spp. Preliminary results of high-sensitivity magnetometry also suggest that the pigment was thermally altered to induce iron oxide phase change to enhance colour properties.

Thirty-four rings were identified, including two previously undetectable at ground level without the use of shallow geophysics. To determine if undocumented rings could also be located using this method, the survey was then extended to an area along the South Carolina coast where shell rings were not previously documented, but which is situated a few kilometers from several known rings. In multiple LiDAR datasets, two faint ring-shaped anomalies were identified within the survey area. Fieldwork in May and July of 2017 confirmed that both anomalies represented low-relief Late Archaic shell rings. We conclude with preliminary data from the July fieldwork on the two rings, and contrast site maps produced using the LiDAR-derived data with those from ground-based topographical mapping, subsurface probing, and shovel testing.

Building monuments is costly in terms of time and energy, and yet it is difficult to see how it contributes to survival and reproduction. In the late 1980s, Dunnell argued that monument building and other apparently wasteful behaviors are in fact adaptive in environments that are characterized by severe and/or unpredictable perturbations. Such behaviors are adaptive, according to Dunnell, because groups that undertake them will have lower birth rates than groups that do not and therefore will be less likely to experience food shortages in bad years. In addition, wasteful behaviors are adaptive because they represent a reservoir of time and energy that can be devoted to subsistence and/or reproduction in times of difficulty.

Fire-cracked rocks, rounded river stones, and other rocks that are not obvious flaked or ground stone tools are a prominent component of archaeological sites that are little recorded and often not recovered from the field.

One was formed by a series of “temple-on-the-east” groups running northwest to southeast. The other consisted of a massive, northeast-to-southwest trending drainage modified for foot traffic. At their intersection stood an uncarved stela. Other stelae marked crossroads, while pairs of temple groups stood at entrances into the drainage road, proper.

Michael Coe was the first to link the four-quarter scheme with Maya ritual practices celebrating the spatio-temporal limits of community. Other researchers demonstrated how such practices were essential rituals of royalty, some even noting the prominence of processional circuits among temple pairs. Still others pointed to the quincunx – the sign for road in Maya glyphs – as a fundamental trope in Maya thought and expression. 

At Wari Camp, therefore, we have a confluence of material images that speak to some of the ways in which the most basic of Maya political units was constituted in symbol and action. This paper will attempt a deeper exploration of the powers inhering in such places, and will argue for the need to better identify them archaeologically.

","Paleolithic","Zooarchaeology","Subsistence and Foodways",TRUE,TRUE,"The creation of a robust method of species identification using collagen fingerprinting, also known as ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) has been useful for objectively defining the composition of the fragmentary component of archaeological assemblages. The method usually works through the measurements of the sizes of collagen peptides following enzymatic digestion, which yield a fingerprint that can be genus or even species-specific. However, even these peptide biomarkers have been determined with a level of subjectivity, largely influenced by those most peaks that are commonly observed. In some taxa, particularly the domesticates, sequence data can be used to confirm this variation but ZooMS is being increasingly applied to a greater range of wild taxa. In the absence of sequence information, peptide biomarkers are proposed through observations from reference material, but often with less confidence. Here we apply machine learning to our assemblage of >10,000 Pin Hole Cave (Creswell Crags, UK) fragmentary Late Pleistocene microfaunal remains, demonstrating that an objective manner of biomarker determination can be achieved which builds upon those already determined manually. Most importantly, machine learning approaches appear able to rapidly identify not only known species but can reveal taxa beyond the expected, widening our knowledge of a faunal assemblage.","europe","paleolithic","zooarchaeology","subsistence_foodways","europe paleolithic zooarchaeology subsistence_foodways",28

In 2015, a survey performed by the Qara Dagh Regional Archaeological Project determined the archaeological relevance of the site, which was then chosen as subject of an archaeological investigation. A step trench on the southern slope of the site verified the presence of LC 1-2 (4800/4500-3850 B.C.E.) and LC 3-5 (3850-3100 B.C.E.) occupation levels. This paper will discuss the data collected and provide interpretations on the implication of the Late Chalcolithic period in the Qara Dagh Valley. The presence of stone tools, particularly obsidian, and the strategic position of Ban Qala on a corridor that leads east to the Shahrizor plain and west to Chamchamal, could suggest that the site participated in some form of trade. Finally, the recovery of several bevelled rim bowls in situ suggests that local ceramic production was being carried out within the context of a wide-spread Mesopotamian ceramic tradition. 
The Ban Qala excavation is one of the first conducted in the valley and will contribute to our knowledge on its occupational history, providing a regional perspective from the mountainous region of Northern Mesopotamia.

In addition to the presence of decorative marine shell ornaments and greenstone effigies which have been interpreted as kingly adornments, recent discoveries of additional buried offerings such as a smashed whole vessel and an uncarved stone monument suggest that this platform was the locus of important ritual activities by at least the Late Preclassic period. These activities share linkages to nearby sites in the valley, and are likely indicative of larger regional sociopolitical processes. Furthermore, our increasing understanding of the structure’s form and construction history shows that this platform required a massive investment of labor and materials, modifying the natural landscape in a truly monumental way.

Therefore, health through time, as well as between the sexes, presence or absence of cultural bodily modifications in relation to health, and socio-economic status were all examined within the northern Three Rivers Region study. Whereas elsewhere in the Maya region studies show dietary differences between males and females and indicate strong preferential treatment of males over females in regards to diet, the skeletal population of the northern Three Rivers Region does not exhibit such discrepancies.  This may have to do with the location of the sites in the Three Rivers Region both in terms of having access to coastal and river trade, as well as being situated near the large Alacranes and Dumb-bell Bajos, which provided a rich agricultural landscape.

","Paleolithic","Zooarchaeology","Migration",FALSE,TRUE,"Work in the Nefud Desert, Saudi Arabia, has been fundamental for establishing the importance of the Arabian Peninsula for Pleistocene hominin populations and their dispersals out of Africa. Recent palaeontological and archaeological exploration in the Western Nefud Desert has uncovered numerous fossiliferous palaeolake deposits and associated archaeology. Fossil assemblages include taxa with both African and Eurasian affinities and indicate a greater diversity in large mammals than resides in the region today. Furthermore, the presence of species such as Hippopotamus and Alcelaphus strongly support an ameliorated climate with expansive grasslands and large, perennial lakes. Favourable conditions likely permitted and promoted an influx of taxa, while subsequent climatic deterioration would have resulted in faunal retreat and/or extirpation. The presence of hominins in Arabia during the Pleistocene is evidenced by fossil remains, stone tools and anthropogenically modified bone, and their dispersal into Arabia was most likely tied to the establishment of favourable conditions and concomitant influx of large herbivores. This is perhaps best exemplified by the relatively diverse large mammal assemblage at Ti’s al Gadah (TAG) and the accompanying evidence for anthropogenically modified bone from various fossiliferous deposits, suggesting repeated hominin dispersal events into the Western Nefud Desert during the Pleistocene.","asia_southwest_asia_levant","paleolithic","zooarchaeology","migration","asia_southwest_asia_levant paleolithic zooarchaeology migration",30

Taphonomic analyses show that carnivores contributed greatly to the accumulation of faunal material, while contributions by hominins were present, but uncommon. Recent excavations in the hominin-bearing layers of Block 2 at Dmanisi have revealed a complex underlying basalt formation that likely dictated much of the site formation processes, both biotic and abiotic. Combining spatial patterning with a 3D model of the excavation generated using Agisoft Photoscan, we identify several areas where the basalt, and the pseudo-karstic pipe and gully formations, have constrained the deposition of material. 3D bone orientations in many areas show strong correlations to the underlying shape of the basalt formation. In addition, spatial patterning of the lithic and faunal material differs depending on stratigraphic layer, which is also controlled largely by the basalt and pipe/gully formations. The distribution of coprolites, however, is independent of these patterns, possibly indicating spatially discrete carnivore activity.","asia_southwest_asia_levant","paleolithic","digital_archaeology_gis","taphonomy_site_formation","asia_southwest_asia_levant paleolithic digital_archaeology_gis taphonomy_site_formation",30

This paper sets out results obtained following a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis of the spatial patterning of stone tools at a study area in the Colorado Desert of southern California. Stone tools are examined based on their utility for an explanation of their use and importance in the lives of prehistoric foragers. Current efforts to understand the prehistory of the region is undertaken, mostly, by environmental consultants in the private sector of archaeology as part of a formal [legal] obligation prior to large land development in the form of green energy projects. The results of such analyses seldom make it to the public as published material. This study employs an academic lens to extrapolate qualitative information from quantitative data from previously unpublished cultural resources management (CRM) investigations in the region. The application of optimal foraging theory, to this study, allows for the examination of human and environmental factors and constraints facilitating predictions and interpretations of prehistoric forager behaviors and their occurrence and frequency in the archaeological record at the study area.

","Bronze Age","Bone Tool Analysis","Material Culture and Technology",TRUE,TRUE,"This paper investigates the production of bone artifacts during the Bronze Age (ca. 3000-1200 BCE) at the central Anatolian site of Kaman-Kalehöyük. At this time, small agrarian societies transformed into more complex polities and states, which gave way to a more centralized and specialized market economy. These transformations in sociopolitical and economic organization resulted in other changes as well. For example, animal exploitation patterns began to reflect a more regulated economy to meet food production, distribution, and consumption demands. Urbanized food management systems also had to meet the demands of craftspeople and specialist, if any, who might have preferred certain skeletal elements over others. In a rural site like Kaman-Kalehöyük, craftspeople, in particular, would use bone as raw materials readily and constantly available for production purposes. More specifically, we seek to elucidate whether preferences for specific bone elements reflect changes in the demands for consumer goods such as game pieces, jewelry, furniture inlays, archer’s thumb rings, bone shaft looms, and needles. More broadly, we aim to test whether there are correlations between changes in sociopolitical and economic organization and production of bone tools through time.

When did Neanderthals disappear? How long did anatomically modern humans (AMH) and Neanderthals overlap, and what implications did this have for interaction, acculturation or interbreeding? Without reliable time control, these questions are unanswerable and unravelling the Paleolithic remains a distant and virtually unachievable goal. 
Recent research in AMS dating has seen significant improvement in the situation, however. One of the main areas of improvement has been in chemical pretreatment and sample decontamination which has resulted in superior purification, particularly of bone proteins targeted for dating. We have been working on dating >100 sites covering the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition across Eurasia. We have used optimized techniques of AMS dating as well as OSL dating, coupled with Bayesian modeling, to produce robust site chronologies. Combining results from absolute dating with paleo-genomics results in novel insights into what happened between 70 and 30,000 BP in Eurasia, as we will summarise in our presentation.

The 16th through 19th centuries witnessed increasing cross-cultural interactions between the Inuit of the Labrador coast and Europeans explorers, traders, and missionaries. The effects of colonialism in this period have been studied with respect to Inuit identity, material culture, gender, and social organization, but the nature of Inuit-animal relationships has received comparatively less attention. In addition to occupying a prominent social role, the sled dog facilitated Inuit mobility and hunting practices, but required considerable care and provisioning. In this paper, we employ carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of bulk bone collagen and amino acids to examine sled dog feeding practices between the 16th and 19th centuries. We analyze the remains of 60 archaeological dogs from six Inuit winter house sites from Labrador’s north and central coasts. While all of the dogs included in this study consumed predominantly marine-based protein, we note a degree of inter- and intrasite variation in both the carbon and nitrogen isotope values of the dogs. This variation is further explored with reference to the settlement history of Labrador, and to other stable isotope datasets from the Eastern Arctic to better understand the changing role of the dog in Inuit society.

The medieval residents of Mewat were stereotyped in contemporary imperial chronicles as primitive rebels, living in a forested hilly backwater, beyond the pale of civilized politics. After conversion to Islam in the fourteenth century CE, one group amongst them came to be known as the Khanzada lineage. The Khanzada founded Indor, a fortified city as monumental as any other in the region, and over the next five centuries, a salient attachment to place and a distinctive material repertoire were intrinsic to the Khanzada tradition.

Gossip is cited with frequency in ethnographic accounts and anthropological analysis as containing a wealth of sociocultural meanings; is it possible in archaeology to gain perspectives from such “immaterial” interactions?  
This study identifies and interrogates the physical environments in which gossip would have occurred, entertainment and congregation spaces in domestic contexts, by modeling Roman domestic space as a performative space in which interpersonal influence was crucial.   In the Roman Empire, gossip was a notoriously influential sociopolitical practice that was enacted and documented in many public forums with great performative flair, and thus provides an excellent case for comparison of the material conditions of this practice with written accounts.

Here we present the innovative use of proteomics to investigate AAD from pig bones of different biological ages collected from an experimental forensic scenario. Furthermore, we explored the proteome variability of bones extracted from pigs that have been buried for different PMIs, to better understand the leaching phenomena associated with taphonomic events as well as the decay of proteins post-mortem.

Pre-Moche, Gallinazo phase urban sites were often located in defensible settings and some show evidence of fortification. However, until now the archaeological record of the Moche Valley has not yielded bioarchaeological evidence of Gallinazo violence. We present the case of a multiple burial recovered from the rural fishing village of Pampa La Cruz, Huanchaco (50 BC/AD100-AD 500). The remains recovered show evidence of severe trauma. These individuals provide us with insight into the practices of violence during this time and allow us to explore the role that violence may have played both in Gallinazo society and in the rise of Moche hegemony.

","Historic","Mortuary Analysis","Mortuary Archaeology",TRUE,TRUE,"One major shift in mortuary practices that happened over the Han dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE) China, from burying bronze/pottery vessels to burying miniaturized architectural models, was usually explained as a result of the contemporary ideology of “treating the dead as alive”, or as a reflection of the social-economic transformation. While these previous interpretations invariably presumed that artifacts were passive representations and projections of ideological/social conditions of their contemporary people, the current paper intends to show the active roles of artifacts by shifting the main question from “what did grave goods represent or reflect” to “how did they influence people and what were their effects”. To do this, the paper first demonstrates that the material context created by existing pottery vessel styles was crucial for the emergence of granary terracotta as the earliest type of miniaturized architectural model; then it discusses how the newly invented granary models, by evoking the cognitive concept of miniaturism through their concrete material forms, resulted in a new category of grave goods being made and popularized, and eventually transformed people’s tomb practices. Thus artifacts should be seen as actively participating in social processes, influencing how people interact with and understand their world.

Major canals, large midden-mounds, and fish-capture/storage facilities were constructed following a ninth-century hiatus during a challenging period of global cooling known as the Vandal Minimum. The succeeding Medieval Warm Period ameliorated the productivity of the shallow-water estuarine environments around Mound Key and Pineland, providing new opportunities. We think that certain leaders were able to mobilize surplus labor to construct canals, maintain and rebuild structures, procure resources from faraway mainland forests, and coordinate and oversee the engineering of “watercourt” structures that probably functioned as fish traps and/or fish storage areas.

D’Hanis originated as an Alsatian colony on the Texas frontier, one of four settled by empresario Henry Castro in the 1840s. By the 20th century, the town had not simply transformed but moved – the railroad had caused a rupture in the settlement that resulted in an “old” and “new” D’Hanis, two competing towns with the same name approximately a mile apart. Today, few structures in Old D’Hanis remain, while New D’Hanis retains the aesthetic of a western railroad town. Archaeologically, this paper examines the spatial and material strategies that residents used to create two places out of one. Narratively, it examines how the town narrates a sense of place in the past and present. This paper aims to explore how we, as archaeologists, might approach the intersections of material and narrative strategies in our studies of place. Further, it suggests that linguistic anthropological methods and theories offer opportunities for historical archaeologists to better understand how people create and maintain places in space and through time.","north_america_southwest_united_states","historic","ethnography_ethnoarchaeology","frontiers_borderlands","north_america_southwest_united_states historic ethnography_ethnoarchaeology frontiers_borderlands",36

While paleodemographic, bioarchaeological, linguistic, and DNA evidence support a thirteenth century Mesa Verde-Northern Rio Grande migration, the lack of clear material culture evidence of this migration is perplexing. Critical to this discussion is the possibility of an earlier, tenth century migration of (presumably) Proto-Tiwa speakers from the Upper San Juan region into the Northern Rio Grande. While scholars generally agree that Proto-Tiwa split from Proto-Tewa no later than AD 1000, the location of this split, and the subsequent movement of Tiwa speakers, remain unresolved. In this presentation, I evaluate the ability of two competing hypotheses to account for the paleodemographic, linguistic, and archaeological evidence underpinning this question. The first hypothesis posits that Proto-Tiwa split from Proto-Tewa in the Upper San Juan region, which would support the idea of a Mesa Verde migration. The second hypothesis suggests a split within the Tewa Basin, which would shift the argument in favor of in situ development.

Although badly robbed, the excavations of the tombs yielded rich grave good assemblages, allowing archaeologists to approach to various elements of the theocratic authority of the late Shang kings. The reconstruction of the formation process of the cemetery has been attempted in the hope that the tombs can be assigned to the kings whose reigns are recorded in Shiji and in Zhúshu Jìnián (the Bamboo annals).  Drawing upon an original novel reconstruction of the relative chronology of the tombs, we examined spatial relationships between them at each phase of the formation process of the cemetery, particularly in terms of which pre-existing tombs the mourners were ‘designed’ to see and in what way, and have analytically revealed some distinct patterns. By comparing the timings of the implementations of those strategies with the genealogical relationships between the kings that were recorded in Shi-ji, we have investigated and reconstructed the social-strategic implications of the selections of those strategies in relation to their historical-contextual backgrounds.

The distribution of artifacts within the site (revealing patterns of behavior by occupants coming and going from the camp over time), and the modeling of the physical location of the camp in proximity to the railroad, slate quarry, creek, and town center, are necessarily conjoined spatial and temporal units, which reveal a social structure dialectically entangled with the nearby town and broader regional economy.

The problem, in part, has to do with discrepancies between dates that come from the same sites. Some dates have been reported to be earlier when the samples came from human remains. These discrepancies have been attributed to the ‘reservoir effect’. In order to investigate this, we analyzed and dated both human and animal remains from three Xiongnu period 'ring' burials in northwestern Mongolia – the so-called periphery of the Xiongnu Empire. Given this region has many lakes and that isotopically “heavy” d13C-values have been detected in cases from other regions of Mongolia, it is possible that fishing played a more important role than previously thought in the subsistence economy of some Xiongnu period pastoralists. Accordingly, paleodietary reconstructions based on dental pathology and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyzes were also examined to evaluate how broad the dietary resources might have been and whether these individuals subsisted mainly on terrestrial animals or if fish made up an important enough source of food as to affect 14C dates.","asia_central_asia","iron_age","bioarchaeology_skeletal_analysis","pastoralism","asia_central_asia iron_age bioarchaeology_skeletal_analysis pastoralism",22

Along the Pacific Coast, the appearance of shell fishhooks has been interpreted as part of different contexts of growing population, economic specialization, and social complexity, among others. Along the coast of the Atacama Desert (18° to 26° Lat. South), fishhooks on Choromytilus chorus shells (mussel) appear in archaeological sites located along 1.6 thousand kilometers of coast with dates around 7500 years BP. Around 4500 BP. shell fishhooks disappeared from the Chilean archaeological record and were replaced by hooks made of cactus spines and animal bones. During the ~3000 years that hooks on mussel shells were present, archaeological deposits show evidence of increasing social complexity, specialized maritime economy and semi-sedentary settlement systems. Changes in hook´s shapes are also identified. Observed changes in fishing technology suggest deep changes within ancient fishing communities of South America, which were probably linked by long distance movements of people along thousands of kilometers. The present work will discuss the archaeological context of mussel shell fishhooks within the transitions experienced by Middle Holocene fishing communities of the Northern Coast of Chile.

These early studies tended towards overly simplistic arguments that often either overtly or inadvertently supported social Darwinism. Recent applications of ethnoarchaeology have also been accused of falling into similar pitfalls. While the critics are right to highlight the limitations of this approach, scholars can avoid making dangerous assumptions by working alongside the societies they wish to study. Working with modern communities to interpret the past is a valuable technique that can reveal different ways of doing that may not have originally occurred to the investigator. This paper shows how the assistance and guidance of carpenters living and working in Cairo’s City of the Dead has enabled a more nuanced and realistic view of ancient woodworking practices. These modern artists have inspired hypotheses that, when tested against the material evidence, have led to a new understanding of technological processes and the position of craftspeople in ancient Egyptian society.

Here we test the hypothesis that domesticated plants produce larger starch granules than their wild progenitors. We measured granules from the Four Corners potato (Solanum jamesii) that were a) grown in the wild, b) associated with archaeological sites, c) propagated in a greenhouse, and d) cultivated in a garden.

Despite this important research, few studies have focused on the actual techniques and apparatus associated with copper production, resulting from of a lack of archaeological finds traditionally associated with metallurgical processes.
Some scholars (Sljivar 2006) have proposed the use of perforated and solid truncated conical vessels as primary smelting apparatus. On this basis, a series of experimental smelts coupled with a program of soil and material analysis were initiated to explore the potential for such vessels to be associated with copper smelting. This paper reports a number of experimental smelting campaigns and evaluates the potential for these early ceramic forms to be associated with the world’s earliest pyrometallurgical tradition.

During the XVI century that population lived in an area considered the cultural borders with the Tupinambá population on the North and the Guarani on the South. This fact allows us to identify some common morphological features on the ceramic, such as vessels for preparation of a fermented drink, pots with an accurate polychromic painting for serving food, and small spherical bows for consumption, among others. We performed a deep statistical treatment employing methods such as inference, cluster and correspondence analysis. The materiality suggests that the Tupiniquim population persisted with their ceramic practices in a long-term historical period. There was a decrease in size of vessels and some technological changes, from the oldest to the most recent periods. This fact, may be related to a change of group organization, from multifamily domestic units, in pre-colonial period, to a few families group, after the establishment of the Franciscan Mission settlement in the XVII century.

In the model proboscidean remains and archaeology sites were realistically distributed on a landscape using variables from predictive modeling and the modern proboscidean ecological record to understand the frequency of coincidental spatial associations.

Comparative analysis demonstrates that the inhabitants of El Mirador conformed to certain widespread Preclassic dietary and animal use traditions. However, other animal use patterns are unique to the site, including on-site rearing of domestic turkeys, which was not conducted on a similar scale elsewhere in the Maya lowlands until the Postclassic (post-AD 1000). Inter-site comparisons of Preclassic animal use also reveal greater reliance on terrestrial fauna at El Mirador despite the presence of extensive wetland habitats near the site.

Fowling thus represented one component of a broad-based subsistence regime that was aimed primarily at decreasing vulnerability to food shortfalls, particularly those caused by failures in the agro-pastoral economy.

Second, the integration of both remote sensing and traditional ground survey technologies provide higher resolutions of analysis for local scales.

This does not hold up, however, when we add Black Virginians into the picture. From free Black potters and enslaved peoples who labored for White potters to enslaved consumers who bought local vessels for themselves, Black Virginians in the Valley regularly interacted with these ceramics.

This allows the dating of remarkably small samples, and it results in the imperceptible removal of carbon from more traditionally-sized samples, such as a charred maize kernel (the botanist will never know a dating sample has been removed). A surface-active technique, plasma oxidation preferentially samples carbon molecules from object exteriors, allowing repeated stratigraphic sampling through accumulations such as soot on fragments of cave or rockshelter ceilings and the interpretation of sequential dates. Masking techniques can focus sampling on only portions of artifacts, and other innovative applications include the dating of organic pottery pigments, residues on artifacts, and organic binders in mineral pigments.

This paper discusses how peat serves such a role, sheds light on the how these processes affect the archaeological record, an aspect of environmental change that has been overlooked. During the colonization of Iceland in the 9th century AD, early Icelanders (Vikings) began to affect and be affected by local environments. Viking colonization led to rapid deforestation of woodland resources, resulting in soil loss and increased aeolian deposition. As wood was scarce, peat and turf were commonly used as fuel sources and construction materials in Iceland. Due to the ubiquity of these materials, changes in the quality of peat and turf potentially influenced past human behavior (i.e., fuel selection, resource management, and waste production) and the archaeological record (i.e., waste disposal, farm mound development, and landscape alteration). Using micromorphology and geochemical analyses on experimentally combusted peat from a continuous bog sequence, this research will identify compositional changes and shifts in fuel quality over time. These data will provide information on resource access, wealth distribution, site formation processes, and human-environment interactions.","europe_northern_europe","arctic","geoarchaeology","environment_climate","europe_northern_europe arctic geoarchaeology environment_climate",37

Thereby, this research discusses new developments in answer to the questions on its origins, homogeneity, and organization of production and diffusion. 
To answer all these different issues, and to develop a broader understanding of Commingeoise ware, this research employed multidisciplinary methods. A typo-chronological study was carried out to standardize chronological data on Commingeoises. It was completed by technological study and experimental archaeology to identify the technologies used in the chaîne opératoire of this ceramic type.

In the Andes, tales of lithification focus on ancestors and local heroes, who, in their petrified state, continue to interact with the living by mediating between their descendants and supernatural deities. Ethnographies and ethnohistories describe large upright stones (huancas) and natural stone formations (huacas) who received the same care from their descendants as mummified ancestral remains and contextual evidence has allowed examples of modified and unmodified stone huancas to be identified in the archaeological record. The equivalency in the treatment of huancas and mummified ancestors raises interesting questions regarding the conceptual relationship between stone and the dead. One possible explanation argues Andean people were motivated to create this association by the desire to transfer qualities of stone (durability) to their ancestors.

This paper will present the findings exposed in excavations conducted in the north-east tower of the keepless castle.  Excavation has shown a complex stratigraphy and multi-phased building construction.  It will be postulated that the identified different phases in castle construction can be linked to changed hands in ownership, reconstruction in response to outside attack, and  period remodeling efforts.","europe_northern_europe","historic","","historical_archaeology","europe_northern_europe historic  historical_archaeology",26

Despite their broad spatio-temporal range, the Denisovans are only known from 4 bones, all from a single cave. This patchy knowledge of an entire human population significantly limits our ability to test hypotheses regarding routes and timing of people movements across Asia, the nature and frequency of interaction between archaic indigenous groups and migratory modern humans, and the mechanisms leading to sole dominance of our species.
In 2017, a new 5-year research project “FINDER”, funded by the European Research Council, was inaugurated, its main purpose being the discovery of new Denisovans. We apply a novel combination of analytical methods, namely collagen fingerprinting, also known as ZooMS, radiocarbon dating and ancient DNA analysis, designed to identify, date and genetically characterize human fossils amongst thousand animal fragments excavated from Denisova and elsewhere in Siberia.

Explaining variations in lithic technology during these millennia can shed light on the processes underlying the slow but steady increase in plant resources that preceded the adoption of agriculture. This study analyzes several chipped stone attributes – including cortex ratio, retouch intensity and frequency, and flaking type – of lithic assemblages from one such rockshelter known as Tzib’te Yux. By examining these traits in a subsample of artifacts, the authors will establish the ability of these methods to detect technological changes over time, and create a timeline of lithic technology using absolute dating methods. This study thus serves as a pilot study for a future project that will compare changes in mobility, subsistence economy, and lithic technology at all three rockshelters using the full assemblages available at each.

This study seeks to test this hypothesis by identifying evidence of changes/continuities in ritual practice at a complex of monument sites along the Wadi Buleh in eastern Djibouti.

As the site grew in size during the fourteenth century, the settlement shifted from a circular to clustered arrangement of structures, to accommodate a larger population. This was accompanied by the development of a distinctive ceramic decorative tradition (deeply incised lines and punctations), coarsely serrated triangular points, chipped limestone discs, and decorated sandstone discoidals. By the late fourteenth century house size had increased, shifting from single- to multi-family dwellings. Fox Farm’s growth and its establishment as a central place within the Fort Ancient region represents a local response to the volatile cultural landscape of the late fourteenth/early fifteenth century.

Through modelling clustering and dispersion of village sites across the landscape, the evaluation of central places and authority in Palau suggests the presence of meaningful settlement patterns at both local and regional scales.

","Bronze Age","Other","Social and Political Organization",TRUE,FALSE,"During the Late Chalcolithic (c. 4500-3100 BCE), the lowlands and highlands of southwest Asia became increasingly entangled both economically and culturally. Interaction during this time was organized through a network of colonial enclaves and diasporas. Following the collapse of this exchange network, the region underwent dramatic changes leading to increased regionalization and ruralization. Scholarly discourse posits that only after centuries of isolation and impoverishment there came a phase of renewed social complexity and interregional interaction during the second half of the third millennium BCE. However, while distinct cultural zones following the Late Chalcolithic display only very little contact in material culture, limited evidence suggests continued interregional exchange structured along very differently principles.
Based on new evidence from work at Kani Shaie in Iraqi Kurdistan, this paper argues that the distinct cultural zones between the Tigris River and the highest reaches of the Zagros chains maintained periodic interaction. This Zagros Interaction Sphere facilitated social and economic ties across dispersed communities inhabiting different ecological zones. These highland-lowland interactions characterize an alternative development of social complexity resulting in the formation of indigenous polities and ethnic identities that are often characterized as peripheral and small-scale to wider developments in Bronze Age southwest Asia.

Coupled with this, epidemiological studies suggest that population numbers were too low for an epidemic to take hold. Reconciling the epidemiological theory with the limited bioarchaeological evidence for the disease requires a closer examination of how behavior would influence transmission. I examine this possibility and report on several agent-based models I created in R to ascertain how tuberculosis may have arisen and dispersed. I incorporate archaeological, ethnographic, and biological data in order to understand how different human cultural behaviors, such as communal hunting, and other factors may have affected the spread of tuberculosis among hunters, gatherers, and foragers.

Households are fundamental units of economic organization in both past and present societies. The examination of ancient household remains enables archaeologists to better understand micro-scale economic activities, and to situate those activities within larger societal contexts. Investigations at San Lorenzo focus on the areas associated with four structure groups. In accord with previous research at this site, analyses of collected data from these groups show similarities in terms of basic domestic activities. Ongoing analysis of lithic macroartifacts indicates differences among households in terms of reliance on local raw materials. The ancient residents of SL-21 and SL-22 produced informal tools with locally available chert. Conversely, lithic debitage collected from structure group SL-25 indicates importation of raw materials from outside the San Lorenzo settlement cluster.

The Late Bronze Age in Israel was a time of social change as Egyptian influence—political, cultural, and religious—steadily increased in intensity, and became more and more entangled with the local Canaanite culture. At Ifshar, we have evidence for the phenomenon of feasting in the archaeological record through ceramics and faunal remains, and suggest viewing this activity as part of vertical patrimonial relationship in which the client gained capital and the patron reinforced the bond over the client. It has been argued, that ritualized feasting and conspicuous consumption played a significant role in maintaining the patrimonial system that is currently theorized to have been employed in Canaan. However, this role has mainly been discussed in relation to large sites and focused on the relationships between peers.

Pipes are not common at Moundville, but they have been found in nearly all areas of the site – from household contexts in its crowded low-status neighborhoods, to its more sequestered precincts on and around mounds on the north side of the site. Their distribution, the varied contexts of their recovery, and their array of forms add detail to our understanding of tobacco’s important role in the social, political, and religious lives of the Moundville people.","north_america_southeast_united_states","mississippian","archaeometry__materials_analysis_residue_analysis","ritual_symbolism","north_america_southeast_united_states mississippian archaeometry__materials_analysis_residue_analysis ritual_symbolism",21

Holly Bend, a prolific and successful early 19th century plantation owned by Robert Davidson in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina has seen multiple excavations and research over the past several years. In particular, a collection of ceramic tobacco pipe fragments that have been excavated are analyzed to better understand the local smoking culture. Several methods are used, including X-ray fluorescence spectrometer analysis to determine local sourcing of the ceramic elements, residue analysis providing plant and material content of the pipe fragments, and a pipe typology identification. Residue analysis yields late 18th and early 19th century plant and material species associated with smoking and planation life. Pipe typology identification provides the stylistic and economic elements attributed to smoking cultures.

Archaeological and historical records indicate these birds were ideologically and economically significant to SW/NW populations, one reason being their association with the rainy, agriculturally fertile lands of central and southern Mexico.

The geological constitution of Sicily is enough complex as the characteristics of the geological units are consequences of the tectonic compression that happened between the beginning of Miocene and the beginning of the Pliocene. Three structural units are basically distinguished :
1. To the north, in the western side (towards Palermo) there is prevalence of carbonatic reliefs  while in the oriental side (Nebrodi Mounts and Peloritani Mounts)  there are metamorphic and terrigenous deposits
2. the central part and western center, is mainly occupied from a graben terrigenous sediment
3. the Hyblean plateau, constituted by carbonate cliffs. Three distinguishable ecological and orographic units characterize the south eastern Sicily: The Aetna volcano, the plain of Catania and the Hyblean Mounts.  During Prehistoric time,  thanks to this geological diversity,  the sourcing of  efficient  lithic raw material was flourishing.  Volcanic glass is virtually absent.

However, new technical developments are bringing another dimension to these old sources of information. Many historic aerial photos were taken in a series of densely overlapping photos to minimize the effects of lens distortion for use in surveillance, cartography, or other purposes where accuracy in measurement was important. While useful, the resulting photos also create stereoscopic sets that are ideal for analysis using photogrammetric methods. These techniques allow researchers to generate three-dimensional reconstructions of the landscape as it existed when the photos were taken. The resulting models can then be compared to models generated from modern imagery to examine landscape dynamics on a regional or local scale at extraordinarily high resolutions. Very small changes to the landscape, and to individual archaeological sites can be mapped, measured and analyzed. In some cases, it is even possible to explore sites that have ceased to exist today.
This article presents selected case studies from North and South America demonstrating some of the unique capabilities of this innovative approach to quickly and efficiently address archaeological questions.

This paper builds on this progress by attempting to quantify the relative influence of certain factors on the Maya region's long-term trajectory. It presents an abstract spatial simulation model of Maya demography, subsistence, and trade over a 3000 year period. It implements relatively generic manifestations of what processes were relevant to the growth, collapse, and regeneration of the Maya system. This abstraction permits quicker model execution times, which then facilitates using data mining and sensitivity analysis methodology to quantify how certain stressor categories contribute to the presence or absence of long term societal collapse. The relative importance of these stressors according to the simulation is then compared to the amount of research attention they tend to receive.

This paper aims to examine the BMAC presence in NE Iran, using Tepe Hissar as a case study, to understand how BMAC interacted with local cultures in this region. The evidence for existence of BMAC in NE Iran and the nature and extent of BMAC’s dispersion out of Central Asia is revisited from the perspective of frontier and borderland studies. The goal of this paper is to identify different types of borderland processes that occured in NE Iran, where these two cultures came into contact.

Diagenesis occurs during burial and results from a combination of two distinct processes: (1) reactions involving indigenous organic carbon, (2) the complexation of collagen with soil humic substances. The radiocarbon measurement of altered bone, then, affects the age of the bone and reflects the presence of the exogenous humic carbon. Because the influence of contamination on radiocarbon measurements is dependent on the age of the sample, removal of humic carbon, particularly for older samples, is a necessity for accurate measurement. Pretreatment methods, such as XAD treatment and single-amino acid radiocarbon dating, have been applied to eliminate contaminant carbon and provide a purified sample for dating.

Early Bronze Age-I at Arslantepe represents a time period when the paleoclimatic dynamics changed towards more arid conditions while the economy of the site shifted from intensive irrigation farming to site-tethered pastoralism. Concurrently, the social organization moved from hierarchic to heterarchic structure. Extensive geoarchaeological research around the site suggests low rate of sediment deposition for this phase. Under more arid climatic conditions, it is expected that various modes of land use would have different impacts on the surface processes. The results of numerous scenarios tested in agent-based models at Arslantepe during the Early Bronze Age-I show that the rates of erosion and deposition change as patterns of precipitation and the mode of land use change. The results of simulations prove that the shift in economic and social organization alleviated the environmental disturbance that the residents of Arslantepe were faced with at the onset of the Middle Holocene.
