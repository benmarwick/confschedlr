As a growing number of papers that explicitly reference the Anthropocene are published, a theme that ties them together is the general lack of continuity on how we should define an Anthropocene. While the AWG strives to reach a consensus definition, we argue that the Anthropocene is best viewed as a ‘boundary object,’ where it can be adaptable enough to incorporate multiple viewpoints but robust enough to be meaningful within different disciplines. In doing so, we can maintain the original intent of an Anthropocene epoch, as a call-to-arms for future sustainable management of local, regional, and global environments, and fundamentally reconfigure established boundaries between nature and culture and the social and natural sciences.",Symposium,Presenter,Todd_Braje,2.5,9,2.5,Fr-morning

There is no serious scientific debate on whether humans have impacted the global ecology, but regardless of the ICS decision to anchor the so-called “Golden Spike” to the advent of the nuclear age, humans are known to have profoundly altered landscapes at deep timescales. Three examples are presented from the African continent: the Middle Stone Age (Pleistocene) of northern Malawi, the Neolithic (early Holocene) of the Sahara and Iron Age (late Holocene) of northern Cameroon in which the concepts of boundaries and potential impacts of human activity are challenged. Human impacts on ecological systems are qualitatively analogous to other keystone species, but quantifiably larger based on our control of fire and other forms of coppicing as landscape management tools.

Using archaeological and environmental data from China between the late Neolithic (ca. 5000 years ago) and the Song Dynasty (ca. 1000 years ago) we explore how the Anthropocene can be conceived as a process that developed slowly over time and that was conditioned by changing human interactions with the environment that were an outgrowth of shifting social, political and even religious practices and behaviors.

",Other,Digital Archaeology,Cultural Heritage and Preservation,"Recent current events have dramatically highlighted the vulnerability of the world's material cultural heritage. Funded by a University of California (UC) Office of the President’s Research Catalyst grant beginning in 2016, the At-Risk Cultural Heritage and the Digital Humanities project catalyzes a collaborative research effort by four UC campuses (San Diego, Berkeley, Los Angeles and Merced) to use cyber-archaeology and computer graphics to document and safeguard virtually some of the most at-risk heritage objects and places. Faculty and students involved in this project are conducting path-breaking archaeological research covering more than 10,000 years of culture and architecture in Cyprus, Greece, Egypt, Ethiopia, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, and Turkey. Our aim is to link UC labs, libraries and museums to form a highly-networked collaborative platform for curation, analysis, and visualization of 3D archaeological heritage data. This paper presents a summary of the objectives of the project and digital field data acquisition and technical achievements since the inception of the project.

Digital Data and Threatened Cultural Heritage,Worldwide,Other,Digital Archaeology,Cultural Heritage and Preservation,"In his influential book “To Save Everything, Click Here” (2014), Evgeny Morozov coined the term “solutionism” to describe a utopian vision that innovation in digital technologies can solve complex social problems. Fueled by Silicon Valley wealth, digital technologies have an obvious glamor. The high-profile reconstruction of the Palmyra Arch by the Institute for Digital Archaeology exemplifies how governments, universities, corporate sponsors, and granting foundations use media attention on threatened world heritage to showcase technological prowess. Do such efforts meaningfully preserve threatened heritage? Do they overshadow often tragic social realities that fuel war and other causes of heritage destruction? How likely are the data to be available, discoverable, and of any future use?

To move beyond solutionism, this paper highlights how digital data need better contextualization. Context is multi-dimensional-- simultaneously physical, social, and intellectual. Contextualization requires developing “human capital” through community archaeology and public education, and sustained institutional commitments for digital curation. Such efforts cannot be siloed institutionally, intellectually, or technologically. Open Context (http://opencontext.org) illustrates approaches to link and integrate heritage data across institutional and community boundaries in ways that can encourage continued development of the human capital needed to make digital cultural heritage a meaningful aspect of preservation.

Tools and methods for this initiative include blending site monitoring data and digital documentation data from environmental data loggers, terrestrial laser scanning, micro unmanned aerial vehicles, ground photography, structure from motion, and thermal infrared imaging. Our workflow produced a comprehensive set of information that quantitatively describes the rate of decay of Çatalhöyük’s buildings overtime and underpins potential causes. This paper discusses our recent effort to integrate our extensive corpus of digital information into a GIS for analyzing the state of preservation of the site. In particular, this paper proposes new methods in predictive modeling for conservation enabled by spatial analysis in 3D GIS.

This session represents an important milestone in the dissemination of the results of the University of California Office of the President’s At-Risk Cultural Heritage and the Digital Humanities project that is a collaborative research effort by four University of California campuses (San Diego, Berkeley, Los Angeles and Merced). This session is non-site and non-era specific and aims to bring together members of the archaeological community with technologists and heritage preservationists to discuss best practices and sustainability for the following main areas of interest: (i) digital documentation and analysis; (ii) online data curation; (iii) dissemination through hybrid print-digital publications and 3D scientific visualization (personal and large-scale Virtual Reality (VR), and (iv) outreach in libraries and archaeological museums using visualization and computer graphics.",Symposium,Chair (Primary),Nicola_Lercari,3.75,13,3.75,Fr-morning

Maya archaeologists have been and continue to evaluate other artifacts classes, but often simply offer NISP values for skeletal elements recovered from these deposits. To further understand their archaeological significance, we analyzed faunal materials from deposits at the sites of Baking Pot and Xunantunich in the Upper Belize River Valley. We identified the species, bone elements, bone artifacts, taphonomic signatures, and quantitative ratios recovered to test whether a deposit can be identified as a midden, part of a feasting ritual, terminal ritual, or other rituals significant to the Maya.

These classifications may accurately reflect a deposit’s stratigraphic placement, but ultimately mask or even misrepresent the diverse social behaviors which led to the creation of such deposits.  Excavations in the courtyard in front of Structure B-6 at Xunantunich, Belize, exposed a dense deposit of artifacts. Through detailed analysis and recovery of the artifacts and ecofacts and an emphasis on both recording and analyzing the microstratigraphy, we argue that this deposit was de facto refuse left by people who occupied the group after a period of abandonment.

We advocate the use of a behavioral-contextual method for studying on-floor assemblages for ascribing them to one of several categories of abandonment. This behavioral-contextual approach examines the vertical and horizontal architectural contexts of artifacts, the relative completeness of vessels, and the represented vessel forms in order to better understand on-floor assemblages. This method accounts for mundane and ceremonial abandonments of gradual and catastrophic nature, along with abandonment with anticipated return. The proposed method is framed in a visual model built on archaeological case-studies from across the Maya world. Most of the featured examples correspond to residential architecture, but this model should be applicable to other types of buildings. While it is far from exact, the interpretational framework that we propose allows to explain the variability of documented abandonment contexts and promises the avoidance of such equivocal terms as “problematical deposits”.",Electronic Symposium,Presenter,Andrew_Snetsinger,3.75,14,3.75,Fr-morning

Remains of a large deposit of Terminal Classic materials were recovered from a corner of the palace’s primary courtyard. Based on its location on the courtyard surface and below collapse, the deposit was assumed to date to the period of the palace’s abandonment. The placement of this deposit was contemporary with Actuncan’s 9th-century renaissance as a post-royal capital after centuries of incorporation into polities ruled by kings located at nearby Classic period centers. Mixter and colleagues have argued that Actuncan’s palace served as a noble’s residence during the Classic period and was terminated during the Terminal Classic because of its symbolic association with external forces that had previously dominated the site. Drawing on new ceramic analysis, this paper looks in detail at the contents and context of the deposit to reassess the significance of the abandoned palace to Actuncan’s thriving Terminal Classic community.

We propose a contextual analysis of terminal deposits to facilitate the development of archaeological interpretations that move beyond the static category of “problematical deposits.” The terminal deposits at Chan are located in its community center, primarily in two locations: in the eastern temple and southern range structure of Chan’s central group. The deposits date to the period of the depopulation and abandonment of the community and are interpreted as terminal deconsecratory acts by the community’s final residents. Most terminal deposits were placed on final structure floors and covered by collapse debris that accumulated through time. One unique terminal deposit, on the final structure floors of a diviner’s room, was carefully buried in a lens of fine sascab suggesting that special care and attention was taken to “bury” the terminal deposits in this room. Examined in context, Chan’s terminal deposits shed light on the uses of key buildings in a community center and illustrate how a dwindling population deconsecrated their buildings at the end of the occupation of a community.",Electronic Symposium,Presenter,Cynthia_Robin,3.75,14,3.75,Fr-morning

This paper presents new, integrated research on anthropogenic fire and landscape change during the Neolithic period (7,700–4,500 cal. BP) in Eastern Spain. Using an analysis of charcoal morphology from sedimentary records, the spatial distribution of prehistoric land-use and fire across the landscape, and an ethnographic review of burning practices of small-scale agriculturalists, this project aims to better understand the socio-ecological processes that drove the pace and scale of agricultural landscape development during the Neolithic.

Studies examining the effect(s) of heating tool-stone at different temperatures and durations may provide insights on the question of human-controlled fire.

Results indicate that consistent effects in lithics heated in high-energy, discrete, long-duration events (i.e., campfire) may corroborate other lines of evidence suggesting human-controlled fire.

",Iron Age,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis: Metallurgical Analysis,Material Culture and Technology,"In the study of technological transformations, there is often much discussion of how innovations are conditioned by earlier systems of technical knowledge. Identification of transitional features is often challenging, however, particularly for questions about the origins of iron smelting and its relationship with copper-base metallurgy. This paper discusses some unusual technological features in iron metallurgical debris (circa 8th-6th c. BC) from a fortified hilltop site in the Caucasus, shedding light on the early development of iron technology. Macroscopically and microscopically, the slags are in most respects classic iron smithing slags. Larger fragments show the classic planoconvex shape of smithing hearth bottoms, and the slag microsctructures are dominated by wüstite (FeO) and small particles of metallic iron. However, analysis of metal inclusions trapped within these slags shows that they contain small amounts of copper and arsenic. These results suggest that the iron forged in this workshop was smelted from the oxidized upper zone (gossan) of a copper-bearing polymetallic deposit. If so, this would provide the first direct evidence of a much-discussed theory that iron smelting emerged from experimentation with copper ore deposits, linking the invention of iron with earlier copper-base metallurgical traditions.",Symposium,Presenter,Nathaniel_Erb-Satullo,4,16,4,Fr-morning

",Iron Age,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis: XRF/pXRF,Network Analysis,"With over 5000 years of production history, Oman was a major ancient source of copper, participating in a trade network that supplied a large part of the ancient world, the extent of which has yet to be fully mapped. As part of the Archaeological Water Histories of Oman (ArWHO) Project, we have been working since 2012 in the Ad-Dhahirah Governorate of Oman to clarify the structure of ancient copper production networks. Methodologically, our investigations employ satellite imagery analysis to map copper resources, ground-truthing of resulting prospectivity maps, systematic and targeted archaeological survey, and x-ray fluorescence of slags and ores. While we are broadly concerned with understanding raw material exploitation, production, and circulation, this paper focuses on modelling Iron Age and Islamic Period networks of production. Sites which demonstrate shared production technologies are used as proxies for social network connectivity. We combine pXRF-derived geochemical analyses of copper slag with formal social network analytical methods (SNA). We use pXRF data to determine technological strategies employed by metal producing communities. We then compare geochemical data between sites to elucidate dynamics of inter-site relations. Combining site-centered data with regional survey data enables multi-scalar analysis that provides a novel view of ancient metal producing societies.",Symposium,Presenter,Ioana_Dumitru,4,16,4,Fr-morning

We propose a new organic molecular proxy for identification of anthropogenic fire in archaeological sediments, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These molecules are a byproduct of the incomplete combustion of organic biomass, and are preserved well on deep time scales. We applied this proxy to Lusakert Cave, a Middle Paleolithic site in the Hrazdan Gorge, Armenia. From these same samples, we also extracted n-alkanes, the molecular remains of the epicuticular waxes of terrestrial plants. We analyzed the dD and d13C values of the n-alkanes to measure vegetation and hydrological changes at the site during its occupation.

Toolmaking, though, has since been observed in not only other primates but also birds, otters, and octopi, among others. Making fire, however, remains an exclusively human skill. Much of our technology can be conceptualized in terms of the control of fire: pyrotechnology. Until recently in human history, the development of new technologies and materials depended on people attaining and controlling greater and greater temperatures. This process began more than one million years ago as the emergence and spread of our species depended on fire for warmth, cooking, and protection. Later we used fire to treat stone and wood implements and to create adhesives to join them together as compound tools. Baked clay eventually followed, as did ceramics, metals, faience, glass, and other substances upon which civilization was built. Additionally, fire is cross-culturally used ceremonially, and it is ascribed a variety of symbolic meanings.

Thus there can be no states or rulers without monuments, elite regalia, official iconographies and the like—although traditionally it is only the human component that has been seen as the active element in this equation. More recently, archaeologists have sought to reconsider humans not as the users of things, but as their partners and co-participants in the social. In this paper I draw on such approaches to rethink anarchism as a particular mode of human-thing relations, rather than as an ideological stance or political philosophy. As a case study, I will examine a set of village communities of the Andean Late Intermediate Period (c.1000-1450) who resided on the heavily forested eastern piedmont to the northwest of Cuzco. Drawing on two seasons of excavation data, I will show how these settlements were founded by people who were attempting to flee the Inka Empire and all it represented. The rise of the Inka Empire entailed complex new forms of human-thing relations, and for the ancient anarchists presented in this paper, not becoming Inka was a process of actively rejecting those relationships.",Symposium,Presenter,Darryl_Wilkinson,4,16,4,Fr-morning

We can do more than simply read these material remains as physical symbols of Roman political power. The intimate collaboration between imperial agents and the material world allows us to interpret the making and unmaking of Roman imperial power on the local level. This paper explores fluctuations in imperial power at Trimithis (Roman Amheida) through the changes inscribed in domestic, urban, and extra-urban material residues. This explicitly multi-scalar approach demonstrates how the entanglements between power, agents, and things reverberated throughout Romano-Egyptian society. Ultimately, I suggest that the same material worlds that collaborated in imperial power are also implicated in its collapse.

",Historic,Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology,Materiality,"To borrow Yuri Slezkine’s formulation, “the Soviet Union was an empire—in the sense of being very big, bad, asymmetrical, hierarchical, heterogeneous, and doomed”. In this it differed little from the early empires that have long held archaeology’s attention. But unlike its precursors, the U.S.S.R. was guided by a political ideology premised vigorously on the relationship between humans and things—between labor, the non-human inputs of production, and property. Imperial sovereignty rested on profound material dependencies that stitched the multiethnic “federation” together, while the individual Soviet subject was forged out of the proverbial hammer and sickle. As with all empires, the promised utopia never arrived, and the Marxist-Leninist “mattering” of politics came at a terrible human and environmental cost. The doom of this bold endeavor is palpable today in the physical ruins of Soviet socialism, which haunt the archaeological record of the contemporary past across Eurasia. Based on preliminary survey, ethnography, and archival research, this paper represents a foray into Soviet materiality and its afterlife, taking as its touchstone the former Soviet republic of Armenia and the industrial ruins that litter its urban and rural landscapes. What is to be done with imperial debris?

",Historic,Ethnohistory/History,Colonialism,"This paper examines the travails of colonial government in Senegal, looking specifically at material histories in the rural region of Siin. One tenet of French colonial policy was to govern through the operation of commerce, specifically through the infrastructure of cash-cropping. If peanut agriculture would, in principle, create both wealth for the colony and ‘African subjects,’ on the ground, peanuts combined with a web of material entities that bent, diverted, or interrupted the flow of imperial power: traditions of community-making; collective attachments to land, self-sufficiency, and ancestral influence; and cultural economies of objects, all of which had long shapeshifted to the beat of broader historical forces.

Tracing shifts in consumption practices during that period, I reflect on the fraught, ambiguous process of colonial rule, whose effects were chronically interrupted, twisted, or evaded by Siin villagers; at the same time, colonial commerce also gradually wove peasants into a web of dependencies – on markets and the state, primarily – whose strains are still felt in rural Senegal today.",Symposium,Presenter,Francois_Richard,4,16,4,Fr-morning

Two answers to this question have received much attention: that empires promote ideologies that support cohesion among colonizers, and that coercion and violence can promote the expansion of empires. I propose a third answer, in which colonizers create varied material forms that may challenge the goals of empire, but later appeal to the king for regulation and control over the material world. To study this proposition, I use the example of coins among Spanish colonizers in Mexico City. Colonizers invented and used a variety of coins, in part by diluting gold into different alloys to make up for the scarcity of gold that they found in the colonies. Thus, they challenged imperial authority by creating new ways of measuring value and wealth (in this case, by creating more wealth with diluted gold). But when they found that their new coins created problems of conversion and exchange, they appealed to the crown requesting regulations over the minting, value, and use of different coins, thereby strengthening imperial authority.",Symposium,Presenter,Enrique_Rodriguez,4,16,4,Fr-morning

Most of the complete objects associated with these burials belong to classic Tiahuanaco style of decorated pottery, but there is also another peculiar pattern of unfired clay miniatures and large pieces of broken utilitarian pottery in the same burials. I propose that this dichotomy helped to reaffirm the participation of people who buried their dead at Cundisa in the broader Tiahuanaco cultural influence sphere, while at the same time cementing and/or underlying a separate local cultural identity (Copacabana lies within the Tiahuanaco hinterland, but relatively far away from the capital). Fancy Tiahuanaco-style pottery, used in life, during the burial ceremony, and accompanying the deceased in their tombs, helped to underline or maybe even create ties with the larger Tiahuanaco polity.

",Other,Ethnohistory/History,Colonialism,"Water plays an undeniable role in the constitution of politics and society, presenting an elemental force to be controlled for the expansion of agrarian economies. The political life line linked with water is perhaps nowhere better illustrated than with the Han Empire whose massive canalization and irrigation works were necessary to facilitate state expansion into deserts and tropics. The archaeological focus on water and agrarian infrastructure has however overlooked other capacities of water, for instance, as a potable substance in the production of life. Because an anthropocentric viewpoint begins with water as a matter of control, water appears as an object existing independently of the wider physical phenomenon. However, if archaeologists are to approach imperial projects as involving new ways of perceiving difference, this paper argues that water presents a contentious form at the intersection of frontier ecologies. Shifting away from infrastructures of water, this paper explores how water forms distinctive assemblages in colonial households beginning with the building of drinking wells in a newly established frontier. Where and how deep and wide to the shape of a well confronted Han settlers with water’s tangibility, an encounter which enmeshed people with water’s less controllable presence in soils and plants.",Symposium,Presenter,Alice_Yao,4,16,4,Fr-morning

Yet many of the objects in consideration were not so much passive material declarations as they were tools for active demonstrations. Authority, regional and local, derived from membership in exclusive imperial echelons; membership that required more than mere badges of identity but performances of imperially-derived authority. This paper addresses the ways in which locals enacted empire as well as what they sought to gain from doing so. It analyses particular accoutrements of feasting and drinking wielded by steppe peoples of Inner Asia in formalized social interactions aimed at legitimizing authority via participation in the Xiongnu imperial regime. Even though they were often heavily imbued with imperial aesthetics, it was not the cups and bowls alone but rather the practices of drinking ceremonies and eating rituals, afforded by the imperially-imbued objects and the people that wielded them, which bestowed power and authority.

Recent research, however, reveals significant environmental and cultural diversity and calls into question whether “Chachapoyas” can meaningfully be understood as a single region.  There is little evidence for any practices that both unified it internally while distinguishing it from others, and ongoing research at the site complex of Tambillo in comparison with other areas of Chachapoyas indicates that the most productive approach at this stage is to focus on characterizing social and cultural patterns at the local level.  Determining how, or whether, higher-order sociocultural units were constituted at the regional level requires greater bodies of data than those currently available.  In this situation, it is both analytically productive and potentially more accurate to understand all interactions as inter-regional, even among groups that were once considered to belong to the same “region.”  Similar geographical and environmental conditions found in many parts of the Eastern Andes suggest that it is important to more broadly evaluate the importance of scale and landscape in characterizing inter-group interactions, and to reconsider models developed from coastal and highland contexts.",Symposium,Presenter,Anna_Guengerich,4,15,4,Fr-morning

The forests collectively represent a global biodiversity hotspot, with many unique species. Environmental gradients are abrupt, with dramatic changes in temperature regimes with altitude, but also with switches in humidity from dry to pluvial depending on exposure to prevailing winds. The steep environmental gradients create dispersal barriers to plants and animals, resulting in highly restricted distributions. Along the >3000 m altitudinal gradient, there are zones where cooling air can form persistent fogs, leading to cloud forests that have moisture-dependent species and low stature trees, which nevertheless provide important ecosystem services. The relatively cool temperatures and steep slopes at higher elevations often discourage human colonization, but some sites include archaeological sites, suggesting that current land use may not be prescriptive of the past. Nonexclusive factors may include past climate change, enclaves with drier microenvironments, transhumance, and use of multiple ecological zones.

Specifically, how do we best recreate meaningful “archaeological regions” within a mosaic of ecological zones and groups with poorly known culture histories? Presenting results from the Proyecto Arqueológico Wimba – 2016, this paper analyzes the chronological development of the Wimba site within the Ceja de Selva of eastern Amazonas, Peru. Based on stratigraphy, radiocarbon dates, material culture, and architecture, Wimba went through both periods of local development and periods of involvement in regional interaction networks in the Late Intermediate Period (1000-1450 CE). The site is located along strategic pathways between the highland Chacha and eastern lowlands, and it includes diverse structures and open spaces that hosted communal gatherings. Excavation results show a long-term occupation that includes at least three phases of architectural construction. Recovered materials indicate that intra-regional exchange networks were most prevalent until the final occupation, when the impact of highland groups was felt. This paper argues that communal gatherings functioned as centrifugal forces in interaction networks, and most importantly helped “emplace” a regional network that incorporated multiple nearby ecological regions.",Symposium,Presenter,Brian_McCray,4,15,4,Fr-morning

Located beside a pre-Hispanic paved road, the rock shelter accommodated mobile foragers, cultivators, travelers, and llama caravans moving through networks connecting societies north, south, east, and west. Despite several chronological gaps, Manachaqui’s sequence extends from the Terminal Pleistocene through the Late Horizon. Diachronic analysis of Manachaqui’s assemblages revealed two major patterns of movement and cultural connections. Early interregional interaction connected societies in regions north and south. By ca. AD 200-400, interaction involving llama caravans pivoted west toward highland societies. This new east-west network overlay, but did not replace north-south interaction that persisted throughout the latter centuries of the sequence. To evaluate subsistence self-sufficiency, it is more useful to examine data from the settlement complexes clustered to the east around 2,800 m in the forested Montecristo valley.

 During the Pomahuaca phase (BC. 1200-800); ceremonial centers with platform architecture appear suddenly throughout the valley alongside the expansion of roads and long distant interaction networks. By the subsequent Ingatambo phase (800 - 550 B.C.), the number of ceremonial centers in the valley decreased despite the florescence of monumentality at the site of Ingatambo and the increase presence of foreign pottery and other exotic materials. This data suggests that the long term development of sociopolitical complexity within the Huancabamba Valley was strongly linked to its interregional relationships and that Ingatambo, as a result of its strategic location, would eventually grow into a major node for both inter-regional and intra-regional interaction.",Symposium,Presenter,Atsushi_Yamamoto,4,15,4,Fr-morning

The centuries following the decline of the Chavín and Chorrera cultures are thought to represent a period of balkanization and (eventual) regionalization throughout much of the Central and Northern Andean coastal and highland valleys as previously established interregional interaction networks were discarded in favor of localized self-sufficiency. However, recent archaeological data from the site of Huayurco in the Jaén Region of the northeastern Peruvian Andes suggests that ceja de selva (and some highland) populations from Ecuador and northern Peru continued to engage in both interregional and intraregional long distance exchange through the end of the Early Intermediate Period. Based on the broad patterning of material culture, these networks were seemingly oriented around the Marañón River and its major tributaries. Through a diachronic comparison of the Huayurco data to artifact assemblages from the ceja de selva and Ecuadorian highlands, I will examine the nature of these intra and interregional exchange networks, the mechanisms that held them together, and their impact on long term cultural change within the Andes.",Symposium,Presenter,Ryan_Clasby,4,15,4,Fr-morning

Largely understudied, scholars have typically regarded the region as either a barrier or conduit for highland-lowland interaction. However, recent investigations show that the ceja was not simply a transitional zone but rather a locus of complex cultural developments that occurred “in relation to” and “independent from” contemporary phenomena in adjacent coastal, highland, and tropical lowland environments. Similarities in material patterning from Ecuador to Bolivia suggest that autonomous ceja de selva societies were integrated within long distance intraregional interaction networks which potentially impacted local cultural change. These networks were oriented around rivers such as the Marañón and Huallaga which facilitated the movement of people, resources, and ideas. Unfortunately, understanding these relationships has often been hindered by models that emphasize highland or lowland developments, and either ignore the ceja, or treat it as a transitional environment exploited for resources.  By analyzing ceja de selva societies as autochthonous and linked by intraregional and interregional interaction, this symposium aims to better understand ceja de selva cultural developments and their participating roles in the rise of Andean Civilization.",Symposium,Chair (Primary),Ryan_Clasby,4,15,4,Fr-morning

My research up North began where the ancestral Sheyenne River entered GLA from the west. After patient mentoring from Doc, results of that work suggested that such geomorphologically complex places are, in turn, ecological complex, exhibiting a tight mosaic of ecotones and microhabitats that provided a rich resource base attractive to prehistoric peoples. Later, the interdisciplinary SCAPE project (Study of Cultural Adaptations in the Prairie Ecozone project), was organized to apply that Holliday-inspired model. Doc’s model was fruitfully applied in many localities along the prairie-forest border, from Alberta to Manitoba.

The Late Glacial and early Holocene landscapes of this region were dynamic with considerable ecological restructuring. Aeolian deposits accumulated in lowland areas and adjacent foothills at relatively high rates, soils were relatively underdeveloped, river down-cutting prevailed across the valley, and wild fires were common. These disturbance regimes and periods of landscape instability fostered a wide expanse of early- to mid-successional mixed vegetation communities that included herbaceous tundra, shrubs and deciduous trees, key habitats for large grazers and browsers that were significant resources for early hunter-gatherer populations.

Major environmental transitions occurred in the region as the Holocene climate warmed and effective moisture increased, including the spread of boreal forests and peat lands, an expansion of lake development, and intensified landscape stability. These transitions introduced changes to the extent of habitat and seasonal availability of mammal and aquatic food resources. We discuss broad human responses to these environmental shifts in this region from the late Pleistocene through the later Holocene.

Prior alluvial stratigraphy studies concluded that arroyo formation near these settlements occurred two centuries after this exodus and therefore was not a contributing factor. The present study used a larger sample of radiocarbon dates, including short-lived, charred plant material from alluvial contexts and tree-rings from several deeply buried juniper trees preserved at the base of paleoarroyo fills, to refine the dating of late prehistoric channel entrenchment in the Zuni Salt Lake area. Bayesian age modeling that included juniper germination dates determined by radiocarbon wiggle matching facilitated construction of a high-resolution alluvial chronology. The revised chronology includes an arroyo-cutting episode constrained to the 60-year interval between AD 1106 and 1166. This finding suggests that terminal Pueblo II depopulation of the Zuni Salt Lake area ~AD1130 probably did in fact coincide with extensive arroyo formation.

Holliday is the 2018 recipient of the Fryxell Award for Interdisciplinary Research in archaeology. The Fryxell Award is presented in recognition for interdisciplinary excellence of a scientist who need not be an archaeologist, but whose research has contributed significantly to American archaeology. The award is made possible through the generosity of the family of the late Roald Fryxell, a geologist whose career exemplified the crucial role of multidisciplinary cooperation in archaeology. The 2018 Fryxell Award recognizes a scholar who has made significant contributions in the application of earth sciences to archaeology. It is fitting that Vance T. Holliday is the recipient, for few figures have in the last four decades been as prominent or prolific in contributing to North American geoarchaeology. Although best known for his meticulous stratigraphic and soil geomorphic work at Paleoindian sites on the High Plains, Holliday’s substantive and methodological contributions span continents, and a range of Quaternary geological, geochronological, and archaeological settings, questions, and even a few controversies. In this SAA Fryxell Award symposium, we explore a range of topics that reflect and were inspired by his outstanding interdisciplinary research in support of archaeological questions.",Symposium,Chair (Primary),Christopher_Roos,4,15,4,Fr-morning

One was the highlighting of a unique kind of urban organization upon lava flows ; as in all four tarascan cities of the Malpaís. Yet, unlike its counterparts, Las Milpillas specificity resides in the fact that a site portion lies upon older volcanics, providing arable lands at hand for the city dwellers to use. Today, newly acquired LiDAR imagery covering the entire city and its environment brought the research to a new scale and raises several important questions regarding the management of agrarian resources and their appeal for human settlers through time.
In this work, we revisit Las Milpillas integration in its volcanic environment in light of the LiDAR imagery. We first present the methods implemented to extract data from the LiDAR derived DEM, and compare the results with the 1980's alidade field mapping. We then assess the human effort undertaken to take advantage of the environment in view of the numerous agrarian features brought to light.

The political, religious and economic systems have been the focus of most archaeological and ethno-historical research, leaving the household systems understudied. It is yet critical to understand the fundamental role of household in the community organization, specifically in the context of the growing social and political complexity that led to the emergence of the Tarascan State. In this paper we synthesize the data collected at different domestic units (commoner and elite houses) excavated at one of the earliest Tarascan city: Malpaís Prieto, located in Northern Michoacán, Mexico. We examine the spatial organization (e.g. architecture, activities), the production and consumption of goods (e.g. ceramics, lithics and faunal remains), in order to reconstruct the daily life at this early urban site, discussing the social, economical and spatial systems of households, and their role in the urban community structure.",Symposium,Presenter,Marion_Forest,3.75,14,3.75,Fr-morning

Such information can provide insight into the production and consumption of artifacts, but may also inform discussions about local political economies. Our study uses qualitative optical petrography and geochemical analysis (NAA) to evaluate the tempers and paste recipes in ceramic fragments and raw clays from Angamuco, located in the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin, Michoacán. Angamuco was occupied before and throughout the development of the Purépecha Empire (1350-1530 CE) and is thus an important case study for understanding the impacts of political change on urban landscapes. Angamuco appears to have been relatively self-sufficient in pottery production, beginning in the Classic and through the Postclassic, including during imperial incorporation. While we did identify some temporal and spatial variation in ceramic production and consumption, pottery technologies and techniques of manufacture appear to have remained relatively stable over long periods of time. Our data point to multiple small-scale producers, who focused on local clays and tempers, generating numerous, complex paste recipes. The results of this analysis contribute to our understanding of ceramic production processes at Angamuco and may be compared to provenance studies in Western Mexico and elsewhere.

Here I explore the use and division of space within the ancient city of Angamuco to document the development of social complexity, complex societies, and urbanism in the Michoacán region. I rely heavily on airborne LiDAR data to document the ‘urban plan’ to show that 1) Angamuco is hierarchically organized in space 2) These spatial arrangements are associated with commoner and elite residential sections, ceremonial zones, and large public spaces; 4) Angamucu is multi-noded and vertically organized on a distinctive malpaís landform.",Symposium,Presenter,Christopher T._Fisher,3.75,14,3.75,Fr-morning

Though the Tarascans have long been overlooked in favor of other better-known Postclassic kingdoms, today scholars are examining diverse topics that include political change, urbanism, environment, and economic trade and exchange. Ethnohistory does play a role in Tarascan studies, but new research increasingly focuses on archaeologically-driven questions, models, and interpretations. For 35 years, Dr. Michelet has worked to facilitate this proliferation of research into Postclassic western Mesoamerica. This session honors Dr. Michelet’s career by bringing together papers that highlight current work in Tarascan archaeology.

The settlement of the island two centuries earlier set off cascading environmental and landscape changes whose agricultural consequences were now evident, including deforestation, erosion, and wetland alteration. Meanwhile, the rise of a wealthy landowning class altered the economic basis of society from primarily household production towards more centralized structures of rent extraction and tenancy. On Hegranes, a region in Skagafjörður, North Iceland, numerous small settlements on the margins of modern farm properties were abandoned during the 11th century. These sites are in localized areas of deep, dry soils between eroded bedrock and wetland, and while some may represent independent households, others likely served specialized functions in the service of larger farmsteads. After the sites ceased to be inhabited, they were used sporadically for livestock management over the next eight centuries. This rapid reorganization of settlement patterns and landscape use reflects simultaneous and interconnected transformations in ecological and social practice. This paper explores how the changing practices of marginal households both contributed and responded to this moment of transformation, as environmental and political factors came together to alter the material ways in which social inequality was organized and maintained.",Symposium,Presenter,Kathryn_Catlin,3.5,12,3.5,Fr-morning

Recent research stresses the role of environmental and ecological fluctuations in the Classic Maya collapse (AD 700-1000). Scholars have linked drought cycles and changing climate to increased warfare and culture change at the end of the Classic Period (AD 200-900). However, numerous studies highlight that not all places in the Maya area collapsed, some communities grew and continued to be places of human settlement for many centuries. More local high-resolution environmental data are necessary to understand the interplay of environment, ecology and Maya culture change. This paper examines data from the Selva Lacandona region to understand how climate and ecology may be linked to social transformation within the vicinity of Lake Mensabak. After the collapse, the Maya lowlands were massively de-populated, but during the Late Postclassic (AD 1200-1600) Lake Mensabak became a place of renewed settlement. As Maya migrated to the lake for its aquatic resources and defensible landscape, elites chose islands with elevated terrain to instantiate a cosmological/ideological scheme.

While marginal highland areas were most seriously affected, resulting in farmstead abandonment, the nature of changes in lowland areas and their impact on the productivity of individual farms is poorly understood. Local patterns of landscape change in Iceland could be highly varied as erosion in one area often resulted in soil accumulation in another.

This newly untethered and mobile lower class searched for avenues for wealth creation previously unavailable. One avenue, in the century following Iceland’s Black Death, was through fishing and fish exports. During this period, previously tightly restricted fish exports flourished in trade between European merchants and numerous fishing and trading sites around Iceland’s coast. The 15th century fishing station of Gufuskálar on the northern coast of Iceland’s Snæfellsnes peninsula demonstrates large and anomalous concentrations of wealth and European trade goods. The site also has evidence of increasingly specialized marine resource utilization. Whether Gufuskálar’s resident fishermen were Icelandic or European, it is likely that this concentration of wealth was only possible through the temporary breakdown in Icelandic social hierarchy.

The movement away from the Catholic church altered the relationship that people had to the physical manifestation of church authority. During the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Church landholdings were sold off to private owners, and the architectural core was repurposed for secular use. Most of the research on the Dissolution focuses on how the new landowners reused the land, or converted churches into manor houses. However, people who lacked the means and resources to make large-scale changes to the former monasteries still found a way to express their new relationship through removing and reusing the stone in the farms and villages near the monastery. At Thornton Abbey, multiple agricultural and village properties were surveyed for monastic stone. The stone was reused as building material, garden decorations, and, more recently, as gifts. How the stone is used appears dependent on the variety and the age of the property, indicating that the stone was interpreted in different ways based on the individuals and their social context. People continue to reuse the stone, marking the enduring presence of the Church on the landscape.",Symposium,Presenter,Sarah_Breiter,3.5,12,3.5,Fr-morning

In Iceland’s changing environment the production of iron, an essential material, became limited not by access to iron ore but by availability of wood to make charcoal fuel. The large-scale production of iron may be one of the primary processes that led to deforestation in Iceland due to the large need for charcoal. Investigations at Stekkjarborg on the farm of Keldudalur in Hegranes, Northern Iceland discovered the remnants of a small-scale iron smelting site dating to post-1104, well after deforestation. The smelting site represents a specific small-scale production activity being conducted in a marginal area for domestic use.

While there are anecdotal stories of earlier settlers, the beginning of large-scale migration to Iceland seems to happen in about AD 870, at the start of Harald Fairhair’s reign, and the time of a distinct volcanic ash layer. The landnám, or land-grab is an important template for our understanding of movements into new landscapes, from the Neolithic Revolution, to the English Pilgrims, and the California Gold Rush. Does the migrant origin of a society define its later nature? Specifically, is the end of the landnám in Iceland reflected in one or more inflection points or is the change from migrant society to settled society imperceptible?

The new tradition was implemented by discrete households that built private churches and cemeteries on their farms. These cemeteries were in use until the beginning of the 12th century and interred were all individuals of the household, men and women, the old and the young, householders and servants. The establishment, management, and abandonment sequences of these cemeteries reflect the religious, social, and political transformations that took place at both societal and household levels during the 11th century. A number of these cemeteries have been excavated in Skagafjörður, North Iceland in recent years. This paper examines the resulting funerary and osteological data for evidence of social hierarchies and changes in household structure during the time of their use. The osteological data points to a population subjected to marginal environmental constraints, but the funerary data indicates a people well versed in contemporary European traditions.

The island's role in trade involved the production of low-cost bulk goods destined for markets mostly via Denmark into the 19th century. The focal area of this paper, the rural and upland Mývatn region, was in some ways socially and ecologically marginal even within Iceland. The growing environment was affected by unpredictable cold weather while volatile erosion zones hemmed local grazing land and hayfields. Although the community was home to two small rural municipal centers, it was distant from coastal trading points. Through interdisciplinary archaeology, environmental investigation, and documentary evidence, this paper investigates and describes how people in Mývatn managed ecological productivity and economic engagement at a periphery. We find that their significant efforts to secure abundance from marginal places was inseparable from social transformations through which the community ultimately assumed an influential role in changing the conditions of regional and national trade.

The initial coastal-focused settlement of the region was followed by the founding of new farms in the deep interior.  Most were not sustained and some farm sites on the coast were also reduced. Initially, the magnate’s farm of Svalbarð had a herding economy supplemented by fishing while Hjálmarsvík, its coastal neighbor, exploited a diversity of marine resources. Around AD 1300 Svalbarð became the chief consumer of the region’s marine resources and Hjálmarsvík become a more specialized sheep-herding farm resembling other small farms. While this switch occurred during a period in which wool production was on the increase in Iceland, it also corresponds to a phase of climatic cooling. New geoarchaeological and remote sensing data provide a means of resolving the roles of these trends on the Svalbarð estate. These local-scale data enable us to assess inter-site variation in growing season and other landscape productivities and hence to model past landscape productivities, in reference to paleoclimate records and satellite data.

However, the reorganization of social and ecological landscapes tends to occur simultaneously, and it is through the interplay between such factors that archaeologically observable disjunctures materialize, including changes in settlement patterns, subsistence activities, or religious practice, among others. Widespread restructuring of labor or social organization can be brought to light by focusing on the moments in which such change takes place, along with accompanying transformations in the way social inequality manifests. Those on the margins--whether environmentally, socially, politically, spiritually, or otherwise--are often at the crux of these moments. Not only are people on the margins directly affected by the outcomes of rapid social and ecological change, their actions and day-to-day activities can also affect the process of transformation.

Prioritizing the Investigation of Sites Endangered by Natural Hazards,North America,Other,Cultural Resources and Heritage Management,Resilience and Sustainability,"Maryland has 8,000 miles of tidal shoreline associated with the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and more than 12-percent of its surface area in floodplains. These are high risk areas for flooding and coastal erosion contain about 40-percent of Maryland’s archeological sites and presumably many more that have yet to be discovered. It is not feasible or prudent to excavate every endangered site, thus choices about which sites to investigate must be made strategically. This paper lays out a reasoned approach to the identification and excavation of endangered sites based on: developing and refining historic/prehistoric contexts; identifying gaps in those contexts, and prioritizing which sites to survey and excavate based on context, archaeological sensitivity, and vulnerability. Other natural hazards and the effects of climate change that will impact archeological sites will also be identified, as the approach to prioritization is applicable to all hazards, and as sites are at risk to more than erosion and rising waters. Finally, ideas will be presented on how to work with non-traditional partners, like emergency managers, to communicate the risk natural hazards and climate change pose to archeological sites and why it is important to “mitigate” those risks to sites.",Symposium,Presenter,Jennifer_Sparenberg,2.25,8,2.25,Fr-morning

Previous archaeological surveys of Block Island concluded that a high frequency, density, and complexity of Woodland (2700 – 400 years before present (B.P.) and Contact Period (400 – 350 B.P.) archaeological sites located on landforms immediately adjacent to the interior salt ponds with far fewer, and much less complex sites located on the bluffs along the seaward coastline.  Larger and more complex permanent and semi-permanent village sites were believed to be located almost exclusively along the salt ponds with smaller temporary and task specific sites associated with freshwater swamps and ponds throughout the interior and near coastal areas of the island. The identification of several large seaward Woodland and Contact Period coastal sites suggest a much more complex settlement pattern than previously believed. These sites are believed to represent spring fishing camps, indicating that earlier reconstructions of Native settlement patterns on Block Island need to be revised.

In the wake of this event, surveys to identify and characterize damaged coastal archaeological sites were conducted in several states.  This work seized a window of opportunity to access and observe sites along highly informative exposures, many of which have since progressively degraded and, in some instances, eroded completely. These surveys prompted the innovation, adaptation, and application of large-scale survey methodologies while collectively advancing understandings of the region's coastal archaeological record, addressing millennia of Native American occupation and centuries of post-Contact Period use. Hurricane Sandy compelled cultural resource management in this part of the world to begin a new chapter, one where archaeological sites threatened by rising sea levels and storms of increasing intensity and frequency present a fundamental priority. This symposium features presentations by several of the archaeologists and administrators involved with this work, who will discuss operational challenges, new perspectives of the past, and the future of coastal archaeology.

An interdisciplinary research program at Xcoch and vicinity from 2006 to 2013 revealed Preclassic Maya community patterns, megalithic architecture, and material culture for a developing complex society. Massive high building platforms, numerous stone pyramids and plazas, heavy stone habitation structures, and an internal site causeway connecting the large Gondola Aguada to the Xcoch grotto are among the many Preclassic settlement features extending across nearly 3 sq km. This paper examines Preclassic settlement patterns at Xcoch and its role as a regional center for the central Santa Elena plain and the greater Puuc region. Other Preclassic sites show mounting evidence for early megalithic architecture and formative ceramics  supporting the presence of a multi-tiered hierarchy within Xcoch's immediate settlement orbit.

This type, classified as Yotholin Pattern-Burnished, has a medium-fine paste and unslipped surfaces that had been smoothed or burnished in decorative patterns. 
Since then, similar wares have been recovered from Preclassic contexts at a number of other sites. Although Brainerd originally described Yotholin as an Early Preclassic type, other archaeologists have attributed it to the late Middle Preclassic. In this paper, we will revisit the contextual evidence surrounding Yotholin and discuss it in light of our work in the Puuc and recent reevaluation of Middle Preclassic ceramics in general. This reanalysis suggests that Brainerd’s initial interpretation of Yotholin was correct and that it is contemporaneous with and/or slightly predates early Middle Preclassic Ek phase ceramics (900-700 BC). It is possible that Yotholin represents the earliest pottery yet identified in the Northern Lowlands. We examine the implications this would have for understanding the origins of the Maya in this region.

How can this power be release or lost? There are many ways in which a building can be imbued with certain attributes that allow expressing and regulating unequal power relations. Along with the form and style of buildings, ritual is perhaps one of the most important means. Through ritual performance, actors imbue the building with the ch'ulel, ensouling and animating it; obliged the ch'ulel to leave the building, killing the animate construction, and make it possible for the ch'ulel to reborn, favoring it to become more powerful. In the  lowlands, the performance of rituals that had as purpose to animate, kill or make reborn buildings is a long-standing tradition that dates back to the Middle Preclassic period. This paper focuses on Structure 1714-Asub of Xaman Susula, a public building interpreted as architecture of power, precursor of the Classic palaces that had administrative and ritual functions but lacked domestic functions of palaces.

On the one hand, this data provides an outlet to better explore the large scale social processes impacting the early macro-region of the Maya area. However, material analysis of recovered shell, lithic, and ceramic artifacts assisted by stratigraphic context has revealed that many of the regional characteristics of later periods, such as shared religious practices, systems of material value, and networks of exchange were much more distinct at the local level than anticipated in the earliest investigated contexts. As a result, the data make it clear that as time progressed from 900 to 350 BC, while Yaxuná underwent urbanizing processes, the presence of material objects increased while the selection of those materials gradually became focused on more fixed sources. In the same way, the previously recognized diversity of material objects became increasingly limited.

For that reason it is an important area when trying to understand the unique characteristics of the Preclassic period in the Northern Lowlands. The Yalahau region is defined physiographically by freshwater wetlands (sabanas), which stand in stark contrast the rest of the Northern Lowlands. These wetlands were utilized by Preclassic inhabitants of the region for agricultural purposes and helped support a dense Preclassic population. The wetlands are framed to the north by the Yalahau Lagoon and Holbox Island. Research by Proyecto Costa Escondida members have revealed the dynamic nature of the coastline during the Preclassic period and there seems to be a correlation between the changing nature of the coastline with the utility of the inland freshwater wetlands for the region’s inhabitants.

Excavations along the center axes in the plaza of the Middle Preclassic village of Paso del Macho in the Puuc region of Yucatan have yielded a series of offerings spanning from the early Middle Preclassic to the cusp of the Late Preclassic. Three different floor sequences were each associated with several offerings. The forms of the nine pottery vessels recovered from the cache are quite unique compared to types normally encountered in Middle Preclassic contexts from the Puuc region. These include a bucket, miniature bowls and dishes, and cacao serving vessels. Several of these vessels contained large greenstone axes and basalt, while another contained a perforated greenstone plaque. Upon reaching sterile soil, a massive pile of basalt fragments was found, under which three large east-oriented greenstone axes were recovered. This greenstone cache bears strong resemblance to other Middle Preclassic place-making deposits from the Maya lowlands, including Ceibal, Cahal Pech, and Cival.

demonstrated that the Valle de Yaxhom, in the Puuc region of Yucatan, was a
significant locus of monumental construction during the latter Middle Formative
and early Late Formative. Two large acropoli, the Acropolis Yaxhom and the
Acropolis Lakin, were previously mapped and tested, but the nature of accompanying
residential construction remained unknown. Two other sites with megalithic
architecture, Nucuchtunich and Nohoch Cep, suggested a transitional occupation
from the Late Formative to the Early Classic period based upon limited
reconnaissance.
LiDAR coverage of the region in May of 2017 facilitated the identification of
a great many more structures as well as contextualizing them in their
physiographic settings. As a result, we identified two large platforms that were
anomalous in form and located close to the Acropolis Lakin as candidates for test
excavations. Five other sites were intensively surface collected. Given our
uncertainty as to the date of the megalithic sites and our lack of an Early Classic
ceramic sample, we also targeted the main civic structure from Nucuchtunich for
testing. This paper reviews the results of this work together with comments on the
ceramics collected.

Yet archaeologists studying the Preclassic Maya of the Northern Lowlands have not only unearthed heretofore unknown sequences of cultural history, but have redefined the nature of social and political complexity for the Maya more broadly. Traditional archaeological methods such as survey and excavation have led to the identification of monumental acropoli, rural villages, and the construction of proto-urban spaces. These methods are increasingly being buttressed if not outright superseded by pioneering archaeological methods, including airborne LiDAR, chemical composition analyses, and sophisticated environmental studies. By exploring the adoption of new expressions of inequality, the effects of sedentary life, the construction of monumental spaces, and interaction with other Mesoamerican peoples, we seek to extend our knowledge of the Preclassic in this region beyond merely being a stepping-stone to the Classic period, and instead focus on its standing as a period of distinctive social and environmental adaptation.",Symposium,Chair (Primary),Evan_Parker,2.5,9,2.5,Fr-morning

The means of finance—whether by surplus production, saving, assuming debt, sharing costs, or other mechanisms—depends on the particulars of the economy in question and can have systemic and long-term consequences for adopters. To show why finance matters in explanations of technological change and how archaeologists can study it, this paper presents a case of household saltmaking in the Basin of Mexico during the Aztec and Spanish empires. Saltmakers adopted several innovations in the manufacture of vessels they used to evaporate brine, but differences in how they financed these changes had divergent effects on the social relations of production. One set of innovations that reduced ceramic vessel production costs during the Late Postclassic correlates with a period of independence and stability among saltmaking households. However, Colonial-era saltmakers became dependent on wealthier investors for access to the means of production, most likely because they lacked the financial means to adopt an innovation involving metal cauldrons.

While commonly referred to as ‘money’, these disks were not currency in the strict sense, though their value is not dissimilar to other traditional and modern objects where worth is arbitrary based on both real and perceived attributes (e.g., size, shape, quality, pedigree, or other factors). These characteristics have corollaries in today’s society for material culture and electronic cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology—essentially, digital ledgers that track financial transactions in real time across a computer network to ensure that they are seamless and incorruptible. Here I argue that transactions involving traditional forms of ‘money’ or exchange valuables are the precursor to Bitcoin and other technologies that demand a unified and continuous chain of information to ensure that the value is known and ownership indisputable.

 In urbanization and demographic scale the two areas are comparable. Mesoamerican and Greek agricultural production was not simply for subsistence, but was market-oriented and market-dependent. Local and long-distance trade often functioned by market mechanisms. The economies had the capacity for real growth beyond Malthusian pace-keeping.
 Greece and Mesoamerica contrast in their current states of method and theory. Mesoamerica has better samples of city and hinterland settlement patterns. Ancient Greece has fuller textual sources. Research on the Greek economy is more in touch with economic theory.
  I focus on two differences. The Old World used silver and state-issued coinage as money; Mesoamerica had goods monies.

The creation and use of a local coinage—silver from the 8th-10th centuries, and copper from the 11th century onward—is often viewed as a way that town leaders emulated features in the Islamic heartland thus linking towns to it. Although the copper coins of the Kilwa region clearly referenced and emulated coin systems in the Indian Ocean world, they were not, we argue, meant to connect Swahili towns to that broader world. This coinage, minted at Kilwa Kisiwani, was used only in a small region of the coast, and found at three towns (where they are plentiful in the archaeological record). We argue that the leaders of these towns created their local coinage as a medium of everyday exchange among the general populace, cognizant of the usage of coins more broadly within the Indian Ocean world, but as an effort to materialize power and authority locally.",Symposium,Presenter,Jeffrey_Fleisher,3.75,13,3.75,Fr-morning

Owned and worked by generations of Maya speakers, narratives of indebtedness to the Rancho’s owners are woven throughout the oral history of the community.

The hidden archaeology of household debt and instability in medieval Iceland,Europe: Northern Europe,Historic,Survey,Political Economy,"Archaeologists generally assume that the absence of market exchange implies an absence of financial debt as a mechanism of exchange and social control found in more ""advanced"" economies. This implicit logic is reproduced in contexts where identifying market exchange largely relies on tracking the circulation of specialized and imported goods, as is the case in medieval Iceland: a society largely made up of subsistence tenant farmers where archaeological indicators of market exchange virtually disappear after the Viking Age settlement of the island. But David Graeber urges us to look deeper for sophisticated systems of value and material exchange in societies that have been traditionally considered to have primitive economies. His work also calls attention to the ways that debt, as a social and economic phenomenon, structures relationships and the juridical status of individuals. Reevaluating medieval Iceland with this lens, we see the disappearance of imported goods following the Viking Age not as evidence of a primitive subsistence economy but rather the development of an entrenched system of financial debt that had profound implications for the juridical and personal status of individuals as a failure to pay debts frequently resulted in the fracture of the family and household.",Symposium,Presenter,Douglas_Bolender,3.75,13,3.75,Fr-morning

Although coins, mainly from the Greek colony of Massalia (modern Marseille) were already present before the conquest, their use appears to have been limited.  After the Roman conquest, the (at least partial) monetization of the local economy at Celtic settlements in Roman Mediterranean Gaul like Lattara significantly transformed notions of wealth and value, with a new interchangeability of wealth emerging.  Combined with the colonial trauma of land confiscations and enslavement, this interchangeability of wealth allowed for the increasing concentration of wealth in an increasingly smaller number of individuals, holding ever more social power of others.",Symposium,Presenter,Benjamin_Luley,3.75,13,3.75,Fr-morning

This paper draws on such data to evaluate the ways that houses and institutions accrued wealth and enhanced inequalities.   Evidence for the production, circulation and storage of food and craft goods in early Mesopotamia informs about the kinds of resources used for wealth building, the processes through which goods took on value, and the role of risk in resource accumulation.  Findings provide the basis for assessing the value and limitations of anthropological approaches to monetary economies in understanding resource accumulation and exchange networks in early urban Mesopotamian societies.

In this symposium, presenters use archaeological data to examine the material traces and social consequences of indebtedness; the processes by which objects become money; and the strategies used to manipulate money, finance, and debt to meet the needs of actors from the scale of the household to the state. An archaeological perspective expands the framework for studying the long histories of money, debt, and finance beyond written records or ethnographies of recent non-capitalist societies. By showcasing research from different parts of the world, the papers in this session also help to counterbalance a traditional emphasis on Eurasian economies in the study of money, debt, and finance.

The roads provided a physical connection between portions of Ichmul, San Felipe, and Yo’okop, running between important structures, out to outlying groups, and even to what had likely been separate settlements. Although they would have been used for processions between termini and may have been had numerous symbolic meanings, the impact of some the roadways on the lives of commoners may have instead been that of impeding the flow of transit. An examination of the contexts, features, and physical forms of these roadways shows how, rather than necessarily easing transit in the manner of most modern roads, some sacbeob were set apart as sacred space no longer available for quotidian functions. In contrast, other causeways seemed to be designed to welcome public access, providing for the ready flow of foot traffic along and across their spans.

Some of these shared planning ideas reflect top-down design concepts related to specialized political and ritual functions for various buildings and features. Although plazas, buildings, and causeways may have had multiple functions, we use excavation data, comparisons to other sites, and depictions in Maya art to argue that the Late Classic rulers of Chan Chich designed some of their monumental architecture to function in part as the theater for public rituals and spectacles, including processions. The processional architecture at Chan Chich included the radial causeways, two possible terminus shrines, a massive range building, the ball court, and the main plaza.

The exceptions to this pattern were known in “urban” cities such as Coba and Chunchucmil in the northern Yucatan and some coastal locations such as Playa del Carmen and Cozumel. However, the latter instances are commonly thought to date to the Postclassic period and were believed to be a departure from the Classic period pattern.

A LiDAR survey in 2016 of northwestern Belize revealed large blocks or groups of residences with boundary walls at the sites of Xnoha, Grey Fox and Blue Creek.  Several hundred residential houselots are with boundary walls enclosing areas of 1000-1500 square meters. The potential implication of this discovery is that Maya “commoners” had very different principles of land tenure than we understood and that they were more akin to our private ownership than we previously understood.

Socioeconomic functions are also evident in the form of other specializations, one household producing specialty crops, another with spindle whorls for fine threads and groundstones, and another for painted gourds.The interpretation of evidence from Cerén documents the division of household groups into social units responsible for different economic needs within the community, which wove a deep fabric of social interaction. Physical markers of the Cerén landscape formed boundaries, agricultural fields separated by crop type, a sacbe and drainage canals dividing fields and providing transition from the border of the site center into the manioc field south of the community, and notably a large adobe block demarcating a division of space between fields, likely related to ownership.

Active manipulation of social systems by intermediate elites and the commoner population seems to have had a great influence on the general process of integration. During the complex negotiations between the various sectors involved it seems likely that the activities carried out through the sacbeob (e.g., processions, exchange of products) would have greatly mitigated the frictions which would have been created. Studies at the communities connected by the Ucí-Cansahcab sacbeob, in the NW plains of the Yucatan, are geared towards exploring these negotiations by considering multiple social sectors. Looking more closely at Ucí as the proposed center for the micro-region during the Late Preclassic, we can assess the benefits and hindrances of regional integration.

As Ek Balam faded in power, smaller communities in the vicinity became tethered to Chichen Itza in a variety of ways.

This town was located at the epicenter of the Maya Social War or Caste War of Yucatan (1847-1901). Preliminary archival exploration suggests that it was occupied as a stronghold for at least the first five years of the conflict. The transformation of everyday enclosure walls into blockades, both of roads and house lots, provide one line of evidence for thinking through the impact of this conflict on the daily lives of Tela’s inhabitants.

In this paper, we discuss the ways in which a formally constructed sacbe at Xunantunich functioned as an axis connecting economic and ritual activities. The architectural arrangement of Classic Xunantunich emphasizes a north/south directionality. The site’s sacbe, however, was constructed on an east/west alignment. This site plan emphasizes a cruciform pattern, which we argue was intentional, and may symbolically represent the axis mundi. In the west, the sacbe is associated with a marketplace and ballcourt. The openness of this area reflects public participation in economic and ritual activities. As the sacbe narrows towards the east, access becomes more restricted. The sacbe terminates at a hilltop group (Group D) where excavations revealed evidence for repetitive ritual activities. We argue that the Xunantunich sacbe may have served as a processional route for periodic rituals that would have reinforced the connection between economic and religious activities, while at the same time legitimized hierarchical relationships within the society.",Symposium,Presenter,Bernadette_Cap,3.75,14,3.75,Fr-morning

",Maya: Classic,Lithic Analysis,Political Economy,"Analysis of the production of imported lithic artifacts, especially obsidian and jade, has been important to recent research on the economic organization of the lowland Maya. However, the data for lithic production has come from a few key sites with clear evidence of workshops devoted to the working of such materials. Less attention has been dedicated to the diversity of obsidian and jade working within individual sites, much less across a given kingdom. This paper presents preliminary evidence for heterogeneity in obsidian and jade working in the kingdom of Piedras Negras, notable for being at the tail end in the exchange of obsidian, jade, and other imported lithic goods. The focus is especially on the diversity of production in household versus non-household areas, drawing comparisons with known market and production areas in Mexico and Guatemala, highlighting the connection with the subordinate center of Budsilha that yielded the best evidence to date for lithic production activities, to better understand regional economic dynamics. Macroscopic analyses are complemented by the results of XRF analysis.

This course uses applied anthropological techniques that allows graduate and undergraduate anthropology students to learn through experience while serving the community. Doctoral students serve as course instructors while guiding master’s and undergraduate students as they instruct and engage with elementary pupils. Through team-teaching and interactive lesson planning, lectures and activities are developed specifically for young children, which are then made available to the public through an open access database. Assessments conducted throughout the semester gauge lesson effectiveness and indicate what concepts need to be revisited. As anthropology is rooted in the sciences and humanities, these classes convey cross-cutting concepts and encourage critical thinking at an early age.

Her summary raised a number of key issues needing resolution.  Among these was the nature of aggregation in the Plateau area of the Virgin Anasazi.  She noted, despite evidence from other places in the Southwest of increasing residential aggregation in PII, there seemed to be little evidence of this from the Mt Trumbull area. In this paper, we present evidence from two sites (Zip Code and Zip Code 2) suggesting a pre-aggregation phase in BMIII or PI times.   These sites are  interesting because, although they are quite large,  extensive sites, they appear to be early in age because pottery is almost entirely unpainted and non corrugated, projectile point styles also seem to pre-date PII, and radiocarbon and OSL dates suggest a BMIII or PI  age.    Other large sites at Mt Trumbull  appear much more aggregated than the Zip Code sites, and  have been identified as PII based on pottery styles, radiocarbon and OSL dates. It is likely  populations were  increasing and more densely clustering together in PII.

This ceramic compositional study using LA-ICP-MS suggests that the sources of the olivine-tempered ceramics found in the Mt. Trumbull and the lowland Virgin areas are not only in Mt. Trumbull but also in the lowland Virgin area, with the latter production centers having used olivine from Mt. Trumbull. The study also suggests that some of the olivine-tempered ceramics made in the lowland Virgin area were moved back to Mt. Trumbull.

Rethinking Pre-Hispanic Communications across the Pacific Coast of Guatemala,Mesoamerica: Pacific Coast,Other,Other,Trade and Exchange,"The Pacific coast of Guatemala has long been regarded as a natural corridor that facilitated travel and trade, and served as a route of migration and invasion, connecting eastern Mexico, the Guatemalan highlands, and El Salvador, with further regions of Mexico and Central America. At first glance, the natural configuration of the coast seems to provide unobstructed passage, especially when compared with the rugged terrain of the adjacent highlands. The maps in many publications feature vague arrows marking trade or migration routes, giving the false impression that the coast was a broad unimpeded passageway. They generally omit details of topography and hydrography, and make no distinction among different parts of the coast. A closer look reveals important distinctions in the feasibility and comparative advantage of communication routes along the coastal piedmont, the coastal plain, and the Pacific littoral. The torrential rivers that cut across the coast posed important restrictions for east-west traffic, and in some cases, for north-south access from highland and piedmont sites to the coastal plain and littoral. In this talk, I will use ethnohistorical and geographic data to argue for finer assessment of coastal communication routes.

The author discusses the ways in which public art, architecture, and elite funerary contexts evolved at Kaminaljuyu during this time, evaluating how these changing styles may have tied into evolving relationships with distant sites and regions such as Teotihuacan, Veracruz, and the Maya lowlands. The Early Classic relationship between Kaminaljuyu and Teotihuacan has, in many ways, eclipsed the myriad other relationships evidenced by Kaminaljuyu’s material record during this time. The singular scholarly focus on the interaction between these two sites has created the impression that Early Classic Kaminaljuyu had a single, monolithic approach to foreign style and a single, primary foreign relationship. Stepping back to consider this time period more holistically, however, a pattern emerges instead of diachronic change and synchronic variation, with Kaminaljuyu laying claim to evolving sets of relationships with numerous foreign powers through time.

While insufficient to produce significant wealth, I argue that the diversity of products available in the lake area enabled its communities to weather broad scale political and economic fluctuations and to retain strong collective identities even during times of political integration.

Given that some archaeologists have interpreted the appearance of the nixtamal/tortilla/comal complex in Guatemala as evidence of the “Mexicanization” of the Maya region, the Pacific coastal region of Guatemala -and its Central Mexican diasporic populations- is seen as the likely source of comales. As a result, comales are useful for tracking the degree/nature of entanglements between coastal and highland populations. Whatever the origin of comales, by the Colonial period, their presence is ubiquitous, despite the fact that documentary sources speak to strained interactions and severed social and economic networks between coastal Pipil and highland Kaqchikel communities. This paper explores coastal and highland interactions prior to and after colonization through the comparative Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) of comales at the Pacific piedmont Kaqchikel Maya site of San Pedro Aguacatepeque and Guatemalan coastal sites. We also draw on Colonial censuses, other archival sources and ethnoarchaeological research as additional lines of evidence that help reconstruct the dynamic, varied and overlapping social and material networks between and within coast and highlands in Postclassic and Colonial Guatemala.",Symposium,Presenter,Guido_Pezzarossi,4,14,4,Fr-morning

In this symposium, case studies drawn from coastal and highland regions, will serve to highlight interregional exchanges while also focusing attention on key themes such as: economic systems, ideological and political evolution, migration, cultural stability and change, and identity. Researchers will discuss the theoretical, methodological, and technical approaches they are using to address these topics and present new data derived from recent analyses of material culture, sculpture, architecture, and settlement patterns. The symposium will serve to update scholars from neighboring areas of Mesoamerica on recent research, and will also stimulate increased communication, collaboration, and data-sharing among regional specialists.

Formed in the Salton Basin by western-trending Colorado River runoff, in-fillings and outflows from the Colorado to the Lake and thence into the Gulf of California were episodic yet constrained by the vast Colorado River Delta. Because modern agricultural development has buried many of the ancient shorelines, the Lake’s Holocene oscillation history is difficult to identify and interpret. Recent improvements in satellite-based photographic quality have made it possible to use the desktop to hunt for prehistoric resources located on the margins of Lake Cahuilla. In this paper, we describe the discovery of a prehistoric cultural landscape made up of thousands of distinctive stone features known to local archaeologists as “fish-traps” using a systematic desk-top analysis and ground-truth process.

An in-situ pXRF study of red motifs was conducted at site CA-TUL-2871, Springville, CA, in the hopes of analytically distinguishing painting episodes, based on the assumption that chemically dissimilar pigments may have been used that are otherwise visually indistinguishable. Six hypothesized painting episodes were identified based on motif type and panel position. pXRF measurements were taken on 8 motifs and 3 rock surfaces. Multivariate statistical analyses showed no significant differences in the hypothesized groupings and, in 2 cases, between motifs and unpainted rock, suggesting that variations in paint thickness, weathering and rock coatings affected the elemental measurements. An experimental study was then conducted to evaluate the effect of paint thickness, confirming its significance in measured results.

",Other,Digital Archaeology,Iconography and Art: Rock Art,"Petroglyphs and inscriptions have been investigated in the Arabian Peninsula at least since 1879, when Lady Anne and Wilfrid Blunt crossed the An Nafud desert and stopped at the now famous site of Jubbah in northern Saudi Arabia. Since that time explorers from England, Belgium, Germany, the US, and the Saudi Department of Antiquities, have recorded images from north to south. Archival materials, including field notes, photographs and letters are available at various institutions, but there is no central repository or website that provides information on access to these sources. Since 2013, the Arabian Rock Art Heritage website (Saudi-Archaeology.org) has presented photographs and documentation based on recent exploration. Now, an effort is being made to expand it with a complete catalogue of photographs from this project and a resource guide to archives at other institutions. The goal is to greatly expand access to archival records for archaeologists and epigraphers around the world to enhance and advance research.

In control experiments, negligible levels of humic acid contamination were shown to be present in the unpainted rock; therefore, no chemical pretreatment was conducted on paint or background samples. To obtain direct dates on the paintings, we oxidized organic material in paint samples using plasma oxidation followed by accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating. Radiocarbon results were averaged using the R_Combine function of the OxCal computer program with ShCal13 curve data to produce calibrated age ranges. We also conducted a mineral analysis on samples using X-ray diffraction to identify mineral pigments used in the production of motifs.

Combining a landscape archaeology approach with theoretical positions emerging from the ‘ontological turn’ in archaeology, my research seeks to investigate the petroglyphs at various interrelated scales - from motif, to panel, to site, to landscape setting - in order to better understand the different functional and ideological levels at which these phenomena operated. Formal approaches using computational photography, principally Highlight Reflectance Transformation Imaging and photogrammetry, are employed to revisit known sites, test earlier interpretations, and to document new sites. Additionally, ethnohistories and ethnographies sought through collaboration with Mi’kmaq and Wolastoqiyik First Nations are used to articulate indigenous narratives alongside archaeological understandings of the petroglyphs.

This style is characterized by finely executed anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures arranged in highly-ordered, complex compositions. Pecos River style anthropomorphs are frequently portrayed with a series of dots emanating upwards from an open mouth. Zoomorphic figures of felines and deer are also represented with this pictographic element. ""Soul Expression"" explores the significance of this recurring motif in Pecos River style rock art and proposes that it is a graphic representation of breath, soul, and speech. In ancient Mexico, breath was believed to be a manifestation of one’s soul. Breath soul, when expressed in ritualized speech or song, was a powerful force engaged in both creation and maintenance of the cosmos. Graphic representations of breath soul and speech first appear in Mesoamerica during the Middle and Late Formative periods (900 to 100 BC) as volutes or scrolls issuing from the mouth of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures.

Since people tend to clean activity areas, especially those that are used repeatedly, visible artifacts are rarely discovered in the context where they were originally used. Microartifact analysis focuses on the tiny fragments (<1 cm) of ceramics, bone, lithics, shell and other microartifacts that are produced as a result of human action. These tiny fragments are much more likely to remain in or near the context where they were originally produced because they are too small to be easily gathered and are often trampled into the soil matrixes of ancient surfaces. This study applies microartifactual sampling, processing and analytical techniques to characterize and compare the activities that took place on ancient surfaces at the site of Pampa la Cruz in Huanchaco, Peru. By examining the ubiquity of various microartifact categories per liter of excavated surface matrix, we isolate loci of food production, suggest which types of local and non-local foods were consumed, theorize about cooking practice and waste disposal, and examine traffic patterns in and around two Gallinazo structures.

Since 2010, I have been excavating multiple sites around Huanchaco bay, located in the littoral of the Moche Valley, North Coast of Peru. One particularity of this coastline is that there is still an active group of fishermen exploiting the sea resources using traditional technology. The continuity between the earliest occupation identified in this area (B.C. 1500-1200) and the present day fishermen is giving us a new perspective for exploring the social, economic and ideological trajectories of the Huanchaco community. In short, instead of framing archaeological occupations as Salinar or Moche, I propose a “Huanchaco identity” created over time by their economic and ideological relationship with the ocean.  To explore this possibility, I present the case of Pampa la Cruz, first occupied around B.C. 350/300 and abandoned roughly at 650/700 A.D. This occupation lasted for more than one thousand years in which this domestic settlement experienced several changes but also continuities in spatial organization and material culture. This paper presents the history of a fishing community and their co-existence with major social, political and ideological movements through time.

The flow of most daily activity likely occurred between enclosed, roofed kitchens with heavily used hearths and enclosed but sunlit patios for food processing, spinning, weaving, and tool-making. However, some residences at Cerro León stood apart, not only because of their spaciousness and greater number of rooms but also their large dedicated ancestor worship areas and supra-household gathering spaces. Are these houses truly atypical? How do Cerro León’s largest residential compounds compare to other residences at the site or to earlier and later patterns of residence in the Moche valley?

Few examples of “Andean Households” are as enigmatic and iconic as SIAR, which were closely associated with the florescence of the Chimú Empire. Large barrios consisting of SIAR architecture are found at the Chan Chan (the Chimu capital) and at all Chimu provincial centers throughout the empire.  Cerro la Virgen once lay in the rural hinterland of Chan Chan at the distal end of a vast system of state fields, which are believed to have supported royal activities at Chan Chan. At the site, well-preserved residential architecture covers 14 ha. We created a 3-D rendering of all the SAIR architecture at the site by processing aerial drone photography.  Recent SAIR excavations at the site were used to identify room types, which were then employed in a quantitative analysis of household and community spatial patterning.  As a result, we were able to identify household units, household clusters, and neighborhoods. Based on this study, we propose new quantitative methods for analyzing households, communities, and neighborhoods in the Andes and other regions.

A molar tooth and skull fragment were sampled from each individual and were prepared for isotope analysis. Stable isotope data from bone suggest that these individuals may have had a common origin (possibly the San Francisco Bay Area). In contrast, data from teeth are more heterogeneous and suggest a variety of different places of childhood origin.

The comparative age distributions consist of the 1870 California mortality census, 1870 California living census (as a proxy for a catastrophic population), mortality data from California military regulars, a hospital distribution, and a prehistoric distribution. The PSJ age distribution shows significant differences from all those groups except the hospital distribution. The PSJ sex ratio (approximately 3 females: 4 males) demonstrates similarities with the 1870 California mortality census. Ancestries present in the PSJ skeletal series indicate that Asian or Asian-related individuals equaled the number of European-derived ones, contrasting with the 1870 California mortality census.

In living groups, stature is employed to evaluate differences associated with time (secular trend), geographic distribution, sexual dimorphism, socioeconomic differences, and from other living conditions. Poor living situations hinder growth and yield shortened statures; advantageous conditions enhance growth and result in greater heights. Similar influences are inferred for past populations and the skeletal samples that represent them, including human remains from a pit at Point San Jose (PSJ), San Francisco. Employing all possible PSJ adult stature estimations in this analysis, they average 64.3 inches. The PSJ statures display a bimodal distribution, with peaks at 62 inches and 66 inches. That bimodality may result from a number of causes: small sample size, over-representation of a few individuals, ancestral differences, or sexual dimorphism. When compared with worldwide adult statures, the PSJ material display average stature.

Skeletal remains from a late 19th century military hospital at Point San Jose (PSJ), San Francisco, represent a commingled assemblage, complicating paleopathological observations on the bones. Unlike bony changes, dental pathologies are often studied by individual teeth. Consequently, observations of the PSJ dental remains are best interpreted using tooth counts. Dental disease and oral stress at PSJ include dental caries, dental wear, dental calculus, and LEH. Frequency data show that 32/165 teeth (19.4%) exhibit LEH. Most teeth display multiple defects, suggesting repeated early childhood stresses. Additionally, 19/160 teeth (11.9%) show carious lesions. Comparisons of PSJ with other historic samples indicate a similar caries prevalence as the Snake Hill Site (1812-1814) and Indian Wars sample (1870-1899), but a much lower rate than historic British, St. Peter’s, Fort Laurens, and Civil War samples.

Although most such studies focus on changes observed at an individual level, the Point San Jose assemblage provides a challenging perspective on paleopathology because it consists of separate skeletal elements lacking association with whole individuals. Consequently, our focus is on the types of bony changes seen rather than specific diagnoses of the etiology of those changes. A total of 240 (12%) bones of approximately 2,000 observable elements show changes in bone shape, bone loss, bone formation, trauma, non-specific infection, or joint disease. Among the elements displaying pathology, the highest prevalence involves bone formation (68%, 163/240) associated primarily with traumatic and degenerative processes. Although bone formation is also associated with shape changes and trauma, joint disease accounts for the majority of bone formation (60%, 97/163).

For most of this time, the use of cadavers was neither ethical, nor legal. In U.S. medical study today, most cadavers come from body donation programs largely resulting from the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA), first proposed in 1968. The UAGA followed a change in social context of cadavers. It introduced the body as property and provided individuals the right to donate their body following death. Before the mid-1900s, the lack of legal avenues for the acquisition of cadavers led to the 18th century practice of grave robbing. In the U.S., “Resurrectionists” exhumed and sold recently buried bodies to anatomists. To stop grave robbing, anatomy acts were introduced in the late 18th/early 19th century. Governed at the state level, these laws outlined which bodies could be obtained legally for use as cadavers. Most laws allowed the bodies of criminals, suicides, indigent, or unclaimed individuals to be used as cadavers. The Point San Jose collection offers an opportunity to understand the social context of anatomy laws during the 19th century and identify those people used in anatomical studies.

Within this context, this paper presents a model for the initiation, establishment, and maintenance of permanent high altitude settlements, especially in middle latitudes. This model takes into account the limiting factors found in such settings, the costs and benefits of different ways of coping with these limitations, and the contexts under which different behavioral strategies and physiological changes might be expected to be selected either for or against. The model is evaluated with archaeological data from the Rockies, Intermountain West and the Argentine Andes. This evaluation suggests that in most scenarios demographic packing triggers increasingly intensive high altitude use, that establishing semi-permanent or permanent settlements requires economic subsidization with lower-altitude resources and increasingly costly high altitude ones, and that maintenance of high altitude lifeways is tenuous and contingent upon both biological adaptation and/or articulation with larger regional economies.",Symposium,Presenter,Christopher_Morgan,3.75,13,3.75,Fr-morning

The wooden shafts used in the extractive technologies of the earliest hunter-gatherers originated outside the Puna, in the eastern lowlands. However, the sources of obsidian used for manufacturing projectile points were located at high altitudes in the Puna, between 4000m and 4500m, revealing the existence of adaptations to very high elevations a few millennia after the initial peopling of South America. The implications of these data are broad, as they suggest that early hunter-gatherer groups inhabiting these very high elevations were using resources from far afield and had a good knowledge of the local and regional landscape that extended into adjacent ecological zones located several hundred kilometers away —a familiarity that would have taken several hundred to a few thousand years to develop and possibly enabled them to associate with and rely on neighbors in times of need.",Symposium,Presenter,Elizabeth_Pintar,3.75,13,3.75,Fr-morning

Prominent mountain ranges separate these clusters of sites, and the question remains, when were these mountains first crossed and/or utilized? These high altitude settings (elevations routinely topping 3000-4400 m) would have presented both challenges and opportunities for the earliest inhabitants of the region. This paper examines the occurrence and frequency of Paleoindian components within the montane, subalpine, and alpine ecosystems of the Front Range and the Medicine Bow Range of the Southern Rocky Mountains. Over 750 sites of all periods (276 prehistoric components) are recorded over an area encompassing seven 1:24,000 scale maps. While limited numbers of late Pleistocene materials are present (faunal remains, Folsom materials), these ranges are dominated by late Paleoindian occupations, found at Early Holocene Allen complex sites such as Carey Lake, Caribou Lake, Fourth of July Valley, and Rollins Pass.

The known sites and find-spots attesting the Late Paleolithic and Mesolithic occupation of this area amount to several hundred. This evidence shows that foraging groups settled in the Southern Alpine region following the melting of glaciers and the re-colonization of mountain slopes by vegetation and fauna during the Lateglacial starting around 17.000 years cal. BC. As environmental conditions became more favorable human occupation intensified. At the same time seasonal displacements towards alpine pastures reached progressively higher altitudes.

Located in western Eurasia, at the crossroads of human migrations out of Africa during the Pleistocene, the Iranian Plateau stands at the centre of models of anatomically modern human dispersals out of Africa. This paper aims to understand the cultural diversity among the first modern human populations in the area, and the implications of this diversity to evolutionary and ecological models of human dispersal through the Iranian Plateau, by re-examining four key UP lithic assemblages from the sites Warwasi, Yafteh and Pasangar of the west central and Ghar-e Boof Cave of the southern Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The results demonstrate that there is a significant degree of cultural diversity rather than homogeneity among the UP throughout the different Zagros habitat areas as a result of the relative geo-topographical isolation of the different areas occupied favouring different ecological adaptations. Based on the chronological and geographical patterns of Zagros UP variability, we propose a model of an initial phase of localised and patchy development of the early UP in the region, with limited subsequent contact among these first UP groups. This has important implications for the origins of biological diversity in the early phases of modern human colonisation of Eurasia.",Symposium,Presenter,Elham_Ghasidian,3.75,13,3.75,Fr-morning

To date, the empirical evidence indicates an initial appearance of humans in the high Andes (up to 4500 m above sea level) in the Terminal Pleistocene, about 12,500 years ago. Early forager sites of the Andes exhibit a spectrum of settlement and mobility configurations, which constitute responses to the structure of resources in their specific habitats. Intriguingly, some of the earliest and highest sites indicate thorough familiarity with highland resources, implying either considerable pre-existing cultural knowledge about mountains or very rapid landscape learning. Current debates center on the identification of explorations vs more permanent settlements, functional configurations of early highland sites with those in lower ecological zones, and the role of physiologic and genetic adaptations in the settlement process. Approaches relying solely on assemblages of artifacts and subsistence remains may be inadequate to resolve these issues. Bioarchaeological study of early Andean skeletons, situated within a well-established context of site- and region-scale archaeological settlement data, can provide key information on diet, provenance, mobility patterns, inter-zonal social connections, and the appearance of novel morphologic and genetic features.",Symposium,Presenter,Kurt_Rademaker,3.75,13,3.75,Fr-morning

",Paleolithic,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis,Trade and Exchange,"Humans have frequented southern Africa’s highest reaches – Lesotho’s Maloti-Drakensberg Mountains – for =90,000 years. As with many high mountain systems worldwide, the Maloti-Drakensberg cast a rainshadow over closely neighboring arid lowlands (the eastern Karoo Desert). Based on previous archaeological and paleoenvironmental work in highland Lesotho, researchers have posited that source populations for human dispersals into the mountain zone often originated in the Karoo, particularly during phases of enhanced regional aridity or climatic instability. Lesotho’s mid/high-altitude temperate grasslands may have been attractive to lowland desert foragers because they offer topographical resource diversity and stable supplies of key resources. Such dynamics would have necessitated the existence and maintenance of strong cultural linkages between these ecologically contrasting macro-regions. To begin testing these hypotheses, we are conducting strontium isotope analyses of ostrich eggshell beads recovered from Sehonghong, a highland Lesotho rock shelter with a record of human occupation stretching from the late Holocene to early Marine Isotope Stage 3, and constructing terrestrial strontium isoscapes in both regions. This paper presents our preliminary results, which demonstrate the existence and persistence of highland-dryland exchange networks and hold implications for tracing the development of social strategies for long-term survival in the southern African interior.

The archaeological case study, Angkor, Cambodia, was the center of the Khmer Empire for over 600 years (9th-15th centuries CE). During this time, the Khmers developed one of the largest and most complex water management systems in the pre-industrial world. In this paper, I use geographic information system analyses to quantitatively and qualitatively assess six elements of adaptive capacity (the amount of water harnessed by the system, investments in infrastructure, human capital, redundancy, equal distribution of resources, and innovation) for six time periods. The relationships and trade-offs among the six elements shed light on agricultural production at Angkor as well as general theory on what elements contribute to the resilience of water management systems.

",Other,Other,Urbanism,"Greater Angkor (9-15th centuries CE) was mainland Southeast Asia’s largest low-density urban area. Some of the most visible aspects of this landscape are the large stone temples constructed by Angkorian kings and elites. While many scholars have hypothesized that these temple enclosures were loci of habitation, few have documented this archaeologically. In this paper, we present the results of two field seasons of excavation at the temple site of Ta Prohm, part of a broader research program that was the first to intensively study temple enclosures for occupation. We used lidar data to focus our excavations and sample various locations within the enclosure. This work demonstrates evidence for residential occupation within the temple enclosure from the pre-11th century CE to the 14th century. A comparison with previous work exploring habitation areas within the Angkor Wat temple enclosure highlight similarities and differences in mound construction, organization of the internal grid system, intensity of habitation, and dates of occupation. We argue that temple habitation was a key component of the Angkorian low-density urban system and that investigating this unique form of urbanism deepens current comparative research on the diversity of ancient cities.",Symposium,Presenter,Alison K._Carter,3.75,14,3.75,Fr-morning

",Other,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis,Social and Political Organization: States and Empires,"Anthropological research suggests that early states and empires frequently relied on state-sponsored building projects to produce networks of state control and identity on the landscape. The production and use of monumental architecture, however, can also be influenced by local agency, resilience and/or resistance, and degrees of socio-political autonomy. Rather than a homogenous blanket of state/imperial power, the result is a mosaic of core state control and local choices across the landscape. Focusing on the Angkorian Khmer Empire (9th to 15th c. CE), this paper employs a landscape network approach to investigate degrees of state control and evidence of intermediate elite power, thus providing a more dynamic perspective of the imperial landscape. These investigations are informed through an analysis of the assemblage of provincial sandstone temples, which were key loci for the negotiation of state and intermediate elite power within the Khmer Empire. Emphasis is placed on understanding the geographic distribution of temples, the acquisition of sandstone for temple production, and temple form and organization, as variations in these variables may reflect different intermediate elite strategies and levels of agentive decision making.",Symposium,Presenter,Kendall_Hills,3.75,14,3.75,Fr-morning

",Historic,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis: INAA,Political Economy,"Angkor’s agro-urban capital covered more than 60 square miles, and its landscape housed farmers and artisans. Constraints of the archaeological record limit our ability to document production scale of most activities; the genealogical skew of Angkor’s epigraphic record in another reason. Yet Greater Angkor’s gardens and fields must have fed residents in the Angkorian state’s epicenter. Artisans built its temples, sculpted temple images, and cast metal goods; specialists and communities tended temples; and voracious elites broadcast political and religious affairs in stone and through pageantry. Some archaeologists studying the multiscalar, multicentric nature of Angkorian production focus on ceramics as proxies for tracking state economy within and beyond Angkor’s urban epicenter. Stoneware ceramics were neither wealth nor staple finance; their functions complemented earthenware and metal objects; and they were ubiquitous in Angkorian households across the kingdom. Kiln excavations in three discrete Angkorian subregions have produced in-situ ceramics; field projects across Cambodia offer samples from consumption sites.

Disease responds to social and biological environments (for instance, settlement distributions affecting contagion, and poverty and malnutrition compromising the immune system), and it has complex effects on society.

Sub-Saharan Africa, like many other parts of the Old World where past mass mortalities were not documented, has been omitted from the debate about the impact of pandemics on deep historical trajectories. This paper suggests that the second pandemic of plague—the infamous fourteenth century Black Death—was responsible for demographic crises south of the Sahara, which in turn created opportunities for new elite groups to emerge. I will discuss possible short- and long-term impacts of and responses to the plague crisis in the 14th century by different communities living in the forest environment of West Africa, as manifested in the archaeological and oral historical records of southern Ghana and south-western Nigeria.

Animals are important resources of food, labor, and secondary products in many societies, as well as symbolically important features of the ritual landscape. As relationships with animals intensify, processes such as domestication ensure that humans are potentially able to control the behavior and deployment of large numbers of animals, altering ecosystems and creating an anthropogenic landscape. However, these types of relationships are heavily structured by the innate attributes of the animals involved. Pre-evolved characteristics create the set of possibilities on which human agents can act, and actions undertaken by animals without the influence of humans can have major impacts on human behavior.

While much attention has been paid to the political context of agricultural production, as well as environmental changes brought about by certain techniques, less has been paid to the active manipulation of productive environments by non-human animals. Within the context of some recent theoretical advances in archaeology and ecology, it has become apparent that animals - intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans - modify the context under which agricultural production occurs. These modified landscapes are inherited by subsequent generations of producers who are challenged to make minor, and sometimes major, adjustments based on changing landscapes. In this paper, we highlight these processes using case studies from historic North America (e.g., earthworms) and the pre-European Pacific (e.g., rats and birds).

We aim to investigate the place-making of agricultural landscapes through an analysis of both helpful and destructive ‘weed’ agencies in traditional planting, weeding, and medicinal practices. Using new LiDAR data from Cobá, we examine the liminal spaces around houselots, sometimes called ‘toft zones,’ to look at time management and place-making at different temporal scales. This shifting social practice and place-making factor into the performativity of weeds, and vice versa. A result of this exercise is the problematization of what it means for a plant to be ‘out of place’ in the ancient Maya agricultural landscape (Head et al 2014) as well as a new appreciation of how certain plants impacted daily time management schemas.",Symposium,Presenter,Harper_Dine,3.75,13,3.75,Fr-morning

A Society Island case study outlines varied human responses to expected events, such as soil creep onto agricultural terraces, and cataclysmic ones, such as major landslides, tropical cyclones, and flooding. Some cataclysmic events had remarkably deleterious short-term effects, but in the long-term created more advantageous residential and agricultural conditions for the indigenous Ma'ohi.

From mineral exploration and mining to primary metal production, manufacturing, and consumption across a range of social contexts, metallurgy influenced a wide range of distinctly human conditions. However, while metals are particularly transmutable, they also rapidly corrode back into increasingly stable mineral compounds in processes that people tried to mitigate and often unsuccessfully overcame. This paper discusses how metal production and consumption leads to this poorly studied phenomenon of material fatigue, where metals embrittled, corrode and ultimately fail, giving way to potentially systematic societal and environmental upheaval with oftentimes unpredictable and disastrous effects. Using ancient and modern case studies, this paper will then examine the human response to overcome the problems of material fatigue. In particular, we examine the case of the 1200 BC Cape Gelidonya Shipwreck found off the coast of southwestern Turkey, and whose cargo of copper ingot and alloy scrap metal demonstrates how some sectors of society worked alongside consumers to recycle fatigued metal. Examination of this metallurgical cycle – from minerals to metals and back again – affords a new perspective on the role of metal technology in human societies.",Symposium,Presenter,Joseph_Lehner,3.75,13,3.75,Fr-morning

This paper analyzes prehistoric and historical responses to monsoons in South Asia in terms of their unpredictable nature, and examines how the monsoons both facilitate and constrict people’s actions. In doing so, the paper compares societal responses to monsoons in the different contexts of rurality and urbanity, which each exert specific exigencies over individual and collective actions. In both situations, conserving seasonal rainwater is crucial to the sustenance of societies but an excess of that water can cause significant destruction. Poets of the past and the present allude to the vagaries of the monsoons, reflecting a society conscious of monsoons’ deceits, but even today, it is nearly impossible to predict how much it might rain, when, and where.

This information, in conjunction with archaeological data from coastal locations, may provide a means for helping us better understand mechanisms for human adaptation and resilience in the face of abrupt, high-magnitude climatic events. The purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) to summarize the current state of knowledge of Holocene hurricane variability in a key region—the Caribbean—where recent findings have identified a number of centennial-scale periods of hurricane “hyperactivity”; and 2), to identify and evaluate the ways that human responses to hurricane activity can be identified in the archaeological record at different spatial and temporal scales, including house and dwelling architecture, to the planning of settlements in protected areas, to regional-scale migration and demographic change.",Symposium,Presenter,Matthew_Peros,3.75,13,3.75,Fr-morning
