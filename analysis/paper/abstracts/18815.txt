heritage interpretation is one of the best methods for preserving cultural heritage since it assists a neighborhood in having a better understanding of the importance of its museums and historic sites. lately, the world has witnessed the loss of many such sites in the middle east. therefore, the adaptation of the american models of interpretation would be ideal for addressing this problem.  this paper provides an example of the use of these methods of interpretation for the preservation of sites in egypt. the current research took place in the mallawi museum in minya, egypt. this museum was looted in 2013 when people broke into the museum and stole and destroyed its objects. after the reopening of the museum in 2016, it was important to establish a community engagement project to assist the stakeholders in understanding the value of its cultural heritage sites. intensive workshops were held in the museum to inform people about the significance of historical and archaeological sites in minya by using several interpretative methods such as storytelling and living history. an assessment survey shows that this kind of project can make a significant impact in the effort to protect cultural heritage sites in the middle east.
