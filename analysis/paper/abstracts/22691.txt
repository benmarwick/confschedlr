the geological constitution of sicily is enough complex as the characteristics of the geological units are consequences of the tectonic compression that happened between the beginning of miocene and the beginning of the pliocene. three structural units are basically distinguished :
1. to the north, in the western side (towards palermo) there is prevalence of carbonatic reliefs  while in the oriental side (nebrodi mounts and peloritani mounts)  there are metamorphic and terrigenous deposits
2. the central part and western center, is mainly occupied from a graben terrigenous sediment
3. the hyblean plateau, constituted by carbonate cliffs. three distinguishable ecological and orographic units characterize the south eastern sicily: the aetna volcano, the plain of catania and the hyblean mounts.  during prehistoric time,  thanks to this geological diversity,  the sourcing of  efficient  lithic raw material was flourishing.  volcanic glass is virtually absent.
this  paper focus on the peculiar contexts of early neolithic  sicilian sites from eastern sicily to discuss their strategy for lithic  raw material procurement, local and exotic, and their potential involvement into the  development of new mobility systems.
