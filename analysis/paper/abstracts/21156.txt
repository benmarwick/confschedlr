the medieval italian settlement pattern was transformed from the 8th - 12th centuries as people moved to inhabit defensible hilltops. the precise timing and reasons for this historical process, known as incastellamento, are not well understood. we initiated the san giuliano archaeological research project to provide high-resolution archaeological data for understanding this phenomenon. two seasons of survey and excavation atop the san giuliano plateau have identified walls and structures comprising a fortified castle dating to the incastellamento period. in this paper, we present preliminary analyses of the food consumption practices evidenced in and around a large hall in use approximately ad 900-1200 in the center of the castle zone. ceramic and glassware analyses provide insight into the medieval inhabitants’ food consumption activities. the vessel analyses are complemented by an investigation of the faunal remains obtained from two specific contexts: 1) refuse from wall support trenches excavated into bedrock; and 2) a large subterranean feature used as a granary before serving as a place of refuse disposal. these data shed light on the economy and feasting practices of the medieval people within a typical small italian castle in an area of lazio where the process of incastellamento has been understudied.
