during the early bronze age, the site of seyitömer höyük in western anatolia, served as both a center for ceramic production and trade. through the innovative use of a mold-making technique, as well as a clay coil and wheel combination method, potters were able to produce a standardized diverse ceramic repertoire at a fast rate. within the site assemblage, a variety of ceramic types are represented, including the depas amphikypellon, a two handled drinking vessel. depas vessels originating from both local mounds, such as küllüoba, and foreign locals, like syros-kastri, poliochni, and kültepe are also present. in addition to these cups, used for both libation and everyday use, zoomorphic rhyta have been uncovered that depict two animals holding a depas cup. this paper reconsiders the daily and ritual uses of the depas cup in light of the seyitömer mound excavations and discusses the movement of this vessel type throughout the aegean islands, balkan peninsula, and anatolian and syro-mesopotamian mainlands.
