this presentation will examine the health indicators of the northern three rivers region belize and compare the results to the larger context of health of the ancient lowland maya. the research was completed through the analysis of the skeletal populations of three separate maya sites, and by comparing results within and among the three sites for a total sample size of 222 individuals. the northern trr had an occupation spanning from the middle preclassic through the terminal classic periods. therefore, health through time, as well as between the sexes, presence or absence of cultural bodily modifications in relation to health, and socio-economic status were all examined within the northern three rivers region study. whereas elsewhere in the maya region studies show dietary differences between males and females and indicate strong preferential treatment of males over females in regards to diet, the skeletal population of the northern three rivers region does not exhibit such discrepancies.  this may have to do with the location of the sites in the three rivers region both in terms of having access to coastal and river trade, as well as being situated near the large alacranes and dumb-bell bajos, which provided a rich agricultural landscape.
