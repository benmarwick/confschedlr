in the twenty years since the o’steen and ledbetter et. al chapters in the paleoindian and early archaic southeast, a great deal of work on the earliest occupations of georgia has occurred. in this paper, we review recent fieldwork and collections research that have contributed to our understanding of georgia’s early record, update distributional data of paleoindian and early archaic diagnostics across the state, and compare this diagnostic distributional data with raw material distributions across the state. we then use this data to consider models for the pleistocene and early holocene occupations of georgia, paying close attention to raw material distributions and possible implications for shifting group interaction patterns over time.
