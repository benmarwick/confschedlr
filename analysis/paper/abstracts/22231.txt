cara blanca, in central belize, consists of 25 pools that run east to west along the base of a limestone cliff. the pre-colombian significance of the pools has been studied by the valley of peace archaeology project, yet little attention has been paid to their post-contact influence on the local and regional landscape. this paper explores the role that pool 6, a shallow lake centrally located in the line of lakes and cenotes, played in colonial logging operations around cara blanca. the 2014 exploration of pool 6 revealed equipment used in logging, as well as historic alterations to the landscape that facilitated the movement of hardwoods from inland towards the coast. while this presentation focuses on post-contact logging, its theoretical emphasis is on the resilient yet malleable nature of evolving landscapes. through a relational perspective, archaeological sites lose the label of “in the past” and, rather, reveal their ever-developing life histories. cara blanca pool 6 and surrounding features exemplify how a space—a landscape—can transform while retaining the core of its essence, tying together past and present.
