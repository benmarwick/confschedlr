holtun, located in the central lakes region of the maya lowlands, was occupied from the preclassic through the postclassic. to date the holtun archaeological project has mapped approximately 13 groups in the site core and over 30 residential groups in the periphery to the north. the majority of these surface residential structures date to the terminal classic and postclassic. the residential groups excavated to date vary in their proximity to the site core, number of structures, construction investment, structure and plaza size, and patio space elements. together these features can be used to discern possible socio-economic status of the inhabitants (ashmore et al. 2004; chase 1992; gonlin 2004; hirth 1993; marcus 2004; masson and lope 2004:197; robin 2013; schwarz 2013). this paper presents an overview of the terminal classic residential groups excavated to date at holtun from within the site core and the immediate periphery. excavations focused on sampling residential groups across the site and cataloging the structures and plaza groups based on the above-mentioned criteria in order to better understand socio-economic status, access to resources, and local production patterns for a wide variety of inhabitants of a single site during the terminal classic period.
