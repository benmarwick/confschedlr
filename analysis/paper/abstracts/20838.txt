the ancient maya site, hun tun is a late-terminal classic commoner settlement located in northwestern belize. research at hun tun operates under the programme for belize archaeological project (pfbap). social complexity at the household level serves as a research theme for hun tun investigations. this paper addresses the ancient maya commoners who lived in household contexts at hun tun while discussing how their role as a hinterland community contributed to ideas of household identity, social formation, and production within the larger la milpa political capital. ancient maya commoners are great adapters to their environment responding to external cultural and natural pressures. analysis of everyday material culture, monuments, and major architecture features from domestic contexts contribute to understanding the role of hun tun within the la milpa hinterland. interpreting the function and use of household spaces are crucial to understand the activities, which took place. knowledge about commoner rituals also serves to incorporate and legitimize hun tun within ancient maya society. specifically, ceramics, various lithic material assemblages, and small find material culture, are among the artifacts recovered from prominent features that will be discussed.
