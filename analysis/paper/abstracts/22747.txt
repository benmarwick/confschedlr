the location of blacksmith workshops is often noted on historic maps, yet the archaeological attributes of the workshops are often not well understood within the context of the 18th century. most knowledge of blacksmithing derives from the 19th and early 20th centuries. the various tools and techniques used to produce and repair metal objects are well documented from these later time periods, as is the spatial layout of the blacksmith shops. these depictions of blacksmiths and blacksmithing are often idealized and not an accurate depiction of the archaeological attributes found on 18th century sites. this presentation explores the applicability of a general model for better understanding the ways in which 18th century blacksmithing spaces were used and how these areas become visible in the archaeological record.
