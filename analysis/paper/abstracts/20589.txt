a decade ago, we suggested that the low frequency of archaeological sites dated from the mid-holocene in several portions of lowland south america (what we have called the “archaic gap”) was due to an increase in the magnitude of dry periods. since then, data regarding paleoenvironmental reconstructions for lowland south america, coupled with an increase of the archaeological knowledge, allows us to reassess the idea of the “archaic gap” and redefine both the areal extent of the phenomenon and its possible causes. however, as expected when larger datasets are available, it is possible to perceive oscilations in the archaeological signal that suggest reoccupation of some areas. although we maintain that the main reasons underlying these patterns are still related to climate, they are most probably related to an increase in climatic variability, and not necessarily an increase in dryness.
