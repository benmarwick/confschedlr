data and spatial visualization programs afford archaeologists various ways of showcasing their research.  programs, such as the knight foundation’s free storymap js, and esri storymaps, are of particular use when sharing our research results with the public and, i argue, are useful for conducting collaborative research with communities.  in this paper, i detail the experience of using online storymap programs in the creation of local history maps created by undergraduate students in collaboration with the anti-eviction mapping project (aemp) of san francisco.  by combining information gathered from archaeological reports, oral histories, and historical documents, storymaps created through these collaborations showcase diverse histories such as the history of social movements on the uc berkeley campus landscape, and the “life history” of city blocks in the soma neighborhood of san francisco.  these projects are situated in the rich tradition of counter-mapping, which juxtaposes maps created by or to showcase the perspectives of non-hegemonic actors with authorized ‘official’ maps.  in creating these maps, students gain experience in conducting primary and secondary research, writing for public dissemination, and gain mastery of the histories beneath their feet.
