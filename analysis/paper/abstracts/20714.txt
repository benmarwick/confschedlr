recent research in the maya lowlands has shown that “e-group” architectural complexes were intricately tied to the development of complex society during the middle preclassic period (900 bc – 300 bc). first identified at the site of uaxactun, guatemala, e-group complexes consist of a western radial platform and eastern range structure. for many years maya archaeologists believed e-groups functioned primarily as celestial observatories.  however, recent data have shown e-groups were the locus of many activities, most importantly early ritual and religion. in this presentation we share the results of excavations in group f at holtun, or the “e-group” ceremonial complex, from the 2015-2017 field seasons. archaeological data suggest group f served as a focus of ritual from the middle preclassic through terminal preclassic periods (800 bc – ad 300). in this presentation we discuss how finds from group f, including monumental stucco masks, caches, burials, and the most extensive collection of preclassic-period maya graffiti, inform our knowledge of the development of complex society at holtun, and offer insights into the basis of preclassic maya political power.
