the typology is one of the archaeologist's oldest analytical tools and it pervades nearly every facet of archaeological research, whether explicitly or implicitly. using theories of practice, ethnographic evidence of native american classification systems, and an interdisciplinary understanding of human perception and pattern recognition, this work attempts to deconstruct and reconstruct the typology as a tool of archaeological analysis, with an eye toward creating a newly theorized typology to be used in native north american contexts.
