the go-ja-01 and go-ja-02 archaeological sites, located in sand stone shelters excavated from the 1970s to 1990s and earliest at 10.400 years b. p., were occupied by hunter-gatherer and agricultural-ceramist groups. recent studies have raised hypotheses regarding the appropriation and construction of the landscape by hunter-gatherer groups, based on evidences related to the rio verde river alluvial plain, the paleoenvironment and the archeological site formation process. the purpose of this study is to present some of the variables used in approaching the geoarchaeological context, broadening discussions regarding the occupation of the area.
