this paper presents a new perspective on the study of the emergence of shuteibo (a type of communal cemetery enclosed by a circular embankment constructed during the late jomon) by employing a macroregional approach combining several analytical dimensions: 1) settlement pattern, 2) site scale, 3) household, 4) burials, and 4) interaction. this approach is crucial to understanding the sociopolitical evolution of community organization and status variability involved in the emergence of the communal cemetery. all of the evidence from the analyses suggests that the emergence of the communal cemetery appears to be tied to the dramatic changes in mortuary practices, economic systems, household organizations and settlement patterns during the latter half of the late jomon of central hokkaido. these factors were also intimately related rather than being isolated factors represented by static models.
