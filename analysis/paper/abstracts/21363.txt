in the last decade, much has been learned about the network of interactions in bronze age eurasia, and the importance of the steppe pastoralists in the creation of this network. however, the mechanisms that enabled societies in ancient china (both those bordering on and distant from the steppe) to participate in the bronze age eurasian arena are still poorly understood. based on the latest archaeological discoveries in china, this article focuses on the participation of four regions of ancient china: the ejin river transfer zone (ertz); the western hexi corridor; central inner mongolia; and the middle yellow river valley. the article analyzes all significant innovations, materials, and technologies transmitted via the eurasian network and adopted in ancient china, with an emphasis on metallurgy and the variations in the mechanism of its adoption across different societies during the bronze age.  through analysis and comparison, this paper argues that the participation of different societies of ancient china in the bronze age eurasian network can best be understood in the local and regional contexts, which were deeply embedded in their natural and cultural landscapes, rather than as the result of the pull from the steppe pastoralists alone.
