this paper discusses the spatial, typological, and stylistic analyses of obsidian and ceramic artifacts recovered from el chichicaste and dos quebradas, two prehistoric sites in the department of olancho, eastern honduras. using geographic information systems and 3d laser scanning technology, analyses revealed the extent of trade relationships that these two ancient communities maintained with sites in mesoamerica and their southern neighbors in central america. we argue that integration of foreign trade goods and ceramic stylistic decoration into local lifeways at these two eastern honduran sites shaped subsequent hybrid cultures that included ideologically perceived status symbols from nearby communities and at the same time infused them with local interpretation and uniqueness.
