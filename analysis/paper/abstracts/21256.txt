saa has an ambition to investigate the demographics of the archaeological profession in the americas, looking to bring together knowledge and advice on how the profession of archaeology (in cultural resource management, academic, government, museum, self-employed, and other contexts) is structured throughout north, south, central america, and the caribbean. saa has now carried out the first step toward this goal, which has been to carry out a targeted pilot project, gathering data on archaeological employment in two test areas – chile and new mexico. doing this has allowed us to test the proposed methods and to obtain feedback on processes in order to learn about how the full study could ultimately best be conducted.
