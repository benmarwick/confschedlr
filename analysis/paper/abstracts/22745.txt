the lapita colonisation was the greatest seafaring migration in human history, occupying all the major island groups in their eastward migration across the pacific, where they became the ancestors of the polynesians. the orthodox model for their origin is as an austronesian movement out of asia, from where they moved into island south east asia, and then into the islands of the bismarck archipelago of papua new guinea, where the culture that we recognise as lapita was born. yet major questions still remain as to the nature and origins of lapita, particularly how much of their culture was a neolithic package brought out of asia, and how much has been influenced by contact with non-austronesians. this is an important question as it cuts to the core of identifying the development of pacific cultures.
the triple-i model proposes that the lapita cultural complex evolved from intrusion into new territories, innovation of new technologies, and integration with established communities. yet most lapita sites are found on previously uninhabited pacific islands, therefore what actual evidence is there for interaction with other communities? this paper will examine this fundamental assumption by investigating potential links between lapita and non-lapita communities on mainland papua new guinea.
