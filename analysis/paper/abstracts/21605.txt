the pre-hispanic city of el tajin (mexico) was inscribed on the unesco world heritage list in 1992. late on in the same decade unesco encouraged state parties to foster “informed awareness on the part of the population… whose active participation [in conservation]…is essential”. using the rapid ethnographic assessment procedures method (reap) on fieldwork in mexico, this paper aims to contrast global and local policies to improve participation of local communities generally and in particular of indigenous peoples in el tajin. the inscription as intangible heritage in 2009 and 2012 of two cultural expressions of nearby tajín village has added complexities to social participation that will also be discussed.
