site-specific archaeological survey of forested environments can be challenging, particularly when ground disturbance is prohibited. site-specific archaeological survey serves as an essential component of archaeological exploration, delineating areas of past human activities on complex multi-component sites. this paper presents the preliminary results of the first season of the alcamo archaeological project, a site-specific survey of the forested summit of monte bonifato in western sicily. this area poses a challenge to archaeologists as iron age, roman, and medieval occupants have used and modified this landscape intensively. field methods employed during the survey are presented as well as how these methods were adapted to local conditions and regulations, demonstrating the necessity for flexible survey strategies in conjunction with intensive data collection. furthermore, this paper addresses the need for balance between collecting high-quality data and survey coverage during short field seasons.
