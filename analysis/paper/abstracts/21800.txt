isotopic studies of faunal remains provide an ecological framework from which to interpret human behavior, including diet, subsistence, settlement, and mobility. in this study, we present isotopic analysis of four well-dated sites that span a 3500-year record along the feather river, the biggest tributary of the sacramento river located in northern central california. through carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur stable isotopes we explore the effects of human population growth on the type(s) of browse that was available for game, as a reflection of landscape modification and maintenance. as well, we hypothesize that as populations grew regionally, game came from a smaller territorial range, and use changes in intra-species isotope variation to evaluate this hypothesis.
