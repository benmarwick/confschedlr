the preservation and interpretation of a historical cemetery within fort vancouver national historic site, vancouver, washington, is challenging due to its multifaceted, multiethnic history tied to a hudson’s bay company fur trade fort (1825-1860) and the establishment of a u.s. army post (1849-2012).  there are many intertwined social connections that address the lengthy and contested history of this pacific northwest place. historical archaeology is a key practice to exploring the nature sacred places and the materiality of the indigenous and settler peoples of the fur trade.  historical archaeology bridges the history, memories, and materiality of fur trade and indigenous peoples with sacred spaces tied to the american colonial old city cemetery and the military landscape of the vancouver barracks. this work aims to build a framework for greater dialog with the diverse publics interested in the site, including indigenous, fur trade, and military groups, and attempts to expose and reconcile fractured and biased narratives to better address the colonial significance of the site.
