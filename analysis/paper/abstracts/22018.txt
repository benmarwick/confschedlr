all of us were taught that hernando de soto “discovered” the mississippi river in 1541.however, few of us are aware that the spanish conquistadors were more concerned about the armada of large war canoes patrolling the river in front of them blocking their passage than their place in history. all of the four surviving accounts of the de soto expedition report that the use of dugout canoes was highly developed at the time of initial european contact in the mississippi river valley and its tributaries -- a wet physiographic region described by one of the chroniclers as the “…land where we never leave the water” and where phillips, ford and griffin (1951:9) declared “...might have fostered an amphibious type of culture.” it is therefore very odd that the archaeological literature on mississippian settlement patterns, mississippi culture and landscape archaeology appears to have almost completely “missed the boat” about mississippian dugout canoe transportation and its influence on settlement-subsistence systems. to help address this omission, this paper provides archaeologists with a contextual guide to understanding the ethnological value of the four de soto accounts and the significance of dugout canoes in mississippian culture as recorded in these chronicles.
