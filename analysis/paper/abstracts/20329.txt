the area south of choapa basin in chile has long been subjected to archaeological research through scientific as well as cultural research management projects. surveys, excavations, and sampling over these roughly 5000 km2 area has yielded over 370 radiocarbon dates plus over 120 thermoluminiscence dates (almost 0,1 dates/km2). dates range from 30000 cal bp to modern, but the human occupation is constrained in the last 13,000 years. such chronometric resolution allows discussing the intensity of occupation of the different environments and landscapes over time. also, it provides means to compare the human chronological signature with the available local paleoclimatic data to discuss if aridity, and therefore shortages in resources, exerted pressure over the human groups inhabiting this area. the distribution of dates in not constant, but rather fluctuating and even showing certain periods devoid of chronological signature. it also exhibits a significant increase in the last millennia coupled with a higher intensity of occupations as suggested by the abundance of late age archaeological sites. the high resolution of the chronology of the southern choapa basin contrasts with that of neighbor areas that may have alternative time distributions as suggested by preliminary data gathered over the last years. fondecyt #1170408, #1140837.
