in this paper, we present an analysis of all recorded paleoindian sites in indiana and place them in a diachronic framework. our findings are part of a long-term project to construct a geographic information systems database of paleoindian sites that can be queried for data relevant to a better understanding of the paleoindian presence in indiana. preliminary data indicate that time-transgressive differences exist for where paleoindians placed themselves on the landscape, and for how paleoindians exploited lithic raw materials. due to different reporting standards through time, state-level data are inherently difficult to compare, however, our team evaluated each site in terms of landform location, artifact typologies, and when available, raw material types. we also describe our experience with various issues related to state-level data and the use of gray literature to help provide additional data and site context.
