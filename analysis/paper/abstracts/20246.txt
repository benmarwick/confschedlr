in the 1980s, archaeological investigations by the point placencia archaeological project (ppap) noted the rapid, single-phase development of monumental construction at the maya site of alabama in the stann creek district. though never fully investigated by ppap, this rapid, ‘boom-like’ development during the late facet of the late classic to terminal classic periods is being pursued in current investigations by the stann creek regional archaeology project (scrap). this presentation, by directors of the scrap project, discusses ongoing research at alabama, particularly the spatial, rank order, and planning analyses being considered as part of epicentre investigations, which we hope will shed additional light on the interesting development processes we believe are occurring in this understudied material culture sub-region of the eastern maya lowlands known as east-central belize.
