specialized production of pottery for exchange was an important component of socio-economic patterns in prehistory in the southwestern united states, having been documented among low-energy as well as more complex societies situated in diverse settings. important questions include when did specialized production become important in local and regional economies and what processes were associated. production of pottery for exchange occurs early in multiple regions of the southwest in both the north and the south. specialized production was well established in the sonoran desert of southern arizona by a.d. 600-700. at the mustang site in the lower verde river valley, located on the eastern edge of the phoenix basin, 70 percent of the pottery (n=10,021 sherds, about 160 vessels) associated with the early formative component was not locally produced, and multiple production sources were represented; much of the pottery was produced along the middle gila river 60 mi (97 km) distant. social mechanisms are suggested to account for this distribution. the early development of specialized pottery production, and likely other materials for exchange and/or markets, established some initial conditions for subsequent cultural elaboration that included the better-known regional ball court and market system.
