this paper suggests that egyptology has reached a critical juncture in which the opening of the field to other areas, such as anthropology and sociology, is critical in revitalising and safeguarding the future of the discipline. discourse beyond disciplinary boundaries is becoming increasingly important in academia, due to wider changes in university structures, employment, and funding opportunities. given the current importance of these issues, the authors wanted to determine how these aspects have impacted the identities, research, and careers of those who are currently entering the discipline. the authors designed and implemented an international survey to gauge the current state of egyptology from the point of view of phd students and early career researchers. the aim of this survey was to determine how these individuals perceived the scope and role of egyptology, its prospects as a discipline, its integration in the humanities and social sciences, and the role of their own research and experience. the survey results are discussed alongside the authors proposal that a more reflexive egyptology, one that engages critically with other disciplines, is needed to help reinvigorate the field and open new lines of enquiry for future research.
