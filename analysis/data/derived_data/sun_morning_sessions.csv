Our lightning round is your opportunity to bring questions directly to a panel of experienced NAGPRA practitioners who understand the reality and complexity of NAGPRA implementation.  Each panelist will offer insights on specific aspects of the law based on their expertise.  Topics will include the National NAGPRA Program, NAGPRA Review Committee, NAGPRA grants, Federal Register Notices, regulations on culturally unidentifiable human remains, international repatriation and the nexus between state laws and NAGPRA.  Panelists will speak on tribal challenges, best practices for consultation, and the role of non-federally recognized tribes.  Additional topics will include NAGPRA compliance in different museum settings (large natural history museums, tribal museums, and university museums), inadvertent discoveries and planned excavations, human remains documentation, and resources for research.

We examine technological trends and present new information on the dating of archaeological sites. We examine the role that climate change plays in the demographic history of Acheulean hominins and whether there is temporal overlap of archaic species and advancing groups of Homo sapiens populations.

Using the approach of museum archaeologies, a multidisciplinary team including archaeologists, anthropologist and biologists has worked together with members of the Ecuadorian Shuar community to address these questions. During this talk some of the initial finds of the project will be presented, including medical digital images, and the viability of ancient DNA testing on this remains.",3170,"Symposium","Presenter","Maria_Ordoñez",2.5,9,2.5,"Su-morning",19

These four decades have seen advances in techniques, applications, theories, and infrastructure surrounding the archaeological sciences.

These narratives suggest that prior to this “revolution,” communities lived in harmony with their environment and any impact was local and trivial. Archaeology has recognised the recurrent issues that diverse human communities have faced in managing energy and how this translates into food production, material acquisition, and social coherence, but, has failed to demonstrate the value of this research to wider Global Change and Sustainability Research Communities. Energy and sustainability are enduring problems for humanity and analyses of current conditions would benefit from a long term historical analysis addressing the relationships among innovation, materiality, subsistence and ideology. Although archaeology has produced extensive data sets relating to long-term human-environmental relations, it is not strongly featured within the Sustainability and Energy Research Community. This session therefore creates an opportunity for Archaeology to pronounce its unique perspective and rehearse its position in providing meaningful contributions to better understanding, modelling, and responding to the energetics of environmental, social, and political systems.",3178,"Forum","Moderator (Primary)","Theresa_Nelson",1,3,1,"Su-morning",2

Cultural heritage potentiates to build community identity and, at a time of increasing cultural diversity in European societies and nationalistic conflicts everywhere, it is prone to be involved in political constructions of the past into the present. Actually, when the European project itself becomes criticized and European common project is weakened, the capacity of cultural heritage to foster issues about common interests and values, calls to bolster a reflexive understanding of heritage, to which related disciplines as mainly Archaeology could contribute. The role of international professional associations and NGOs active in the field of cultural heritage is to ensure impartial and yet politically informed interpretation of cultural heritage, facilitating its preservation by making it of public concern. The forum will discuss how to relate past with the present and make archaeological heritage relevant for the public.",3186,"Forum","Moderator (Primary)","Felipe_Criado-Boado",1,3,1,"Su-morning",6
