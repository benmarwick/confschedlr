expanding on a previous report, we present results of stable carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isotope analyses from collagen of three early and two late-middle holocene adult human burials with coeval faunal remains of cuncaicha rockshelter in the peruvian puna. we also reconstruct important aspects of the ecology of the pucuncho basin, in which cuncaicha is located, using new and published isotopic values of archaeological and modern fauna and plants. sulfur isotope values indicate a distinct local geochemical signal, and contribute to the development of models for the interpretation of paleo-diet. nitrogen and carbon isotope values show a human consumption of protein from local highland animals and plant, adding to our understanding of human behavior in extremely challenging environments. we address issues of aridity and altitude in isotope signals, and chronological variation in productivity and foraging. as one of the oldest archaeological sites in south america for which stable isotope data are available, the apparent prolonged occupation of the pucuncho basin is important for understanding early forager settlement strategies and resource exploitation in puna ecosystems, and thus for the onset of adaptations to high altitude.
