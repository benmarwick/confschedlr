revitalization movements have been a topic of particular interest to anthropologists concerned with culture contact and colonialism. as a cultural practice that is present in many historical periods, it stands to reason that revitalization was undertaken in the deep past as well. archaeology has proven useful in exploring the aftermath of the pueblo revolt of 1680 from a native american perspective in the american southwest, and recently, scholars have begun to look for potential revitalization movements in the american southeast. in this paper, i develop a model for assessing revitalization movements on the archaeological record, drawing on scholarship on the pueblo revolt and emerging scholarship about a protohistoric revitalization movement in the mississippian southeast. i use this model to analyze responses to spanish colonialism in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries at the berry site, the site of the native american town of joara and the spanish fort san juan in modern western north carolina, and at mission san luis de apalachee, a mission settlement in modern-day tallahassee, florida. i then offer tentative conclusions about the nature of response to spanish colonialism in both case studies.
