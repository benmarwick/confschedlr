this paper presents a new methodology for the sequencing of behavioural activities in blurred sub-surface stone artefact assemblages. while methods have previously been presented for the identification of behavioural activities, these studies have been conducted in temporally bounded living floors, usually in cave environments. this study develops a method, here termed event-based analysis (eba), for the temporal sequencing of discrete activities in blurred, undifferentiated and temporally-deep deposits. this shifts the unit of analysis in buried palimpsests from the assemblage to the event, and allows inferences regarding behavioural shifts to be built over time and space. an example is provided from the buried palimpsests of lake george, in south-eastern australia.
