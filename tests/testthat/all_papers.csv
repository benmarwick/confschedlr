Although the permafrost helps to maintain these features in excellent condition, the giant puzzle resulting from the collapse of the frame makes it hard to understand their original architecture. During the ArcticCHAR project, we excavated a house at Kuukpak (Northwest Territories, Canada) in 2014 and 2016. Facing the complexity of this feature, we created a new strategy to help us interpret this tangle of wooden remains. Combining both computer techniques (i.e. G.I.S, photogrammetry) with traditional field recording methods required a robust database to connect all of these data.
In this paper, we explain the design of the database and the technical choices we faced during its creation and implementation, with one of our main goals being to use open-source software. Without a doubt, this methodology will help us to understand the building techniques of these impressive Western Arctic houses. Additionally, the use of open-source products will ensure the reproducibility of our method.",1,Symposium,NA,1,Remi,Mereuze

Given the untenability of the core area model and that populations fluctuated over time and space, a reevaluation of lithic technologies and their change through time can help distinguish how the transfer of cultural information took place, and in turn how social life responded to drastic demographic change. Paleo-Inuit use of stone tools was a varied and highly skilled discipline involving intimate knowledge of the land, the properties of stone, and the appropriate ways of crafting tools.

The 16th through 19th centuries witnessed increasing cross-cultural interactions between the Inuit of the Labrador coast and Europeans explorers, traders, and missionaries. The effects of colonialism in this period have been studied with respect to Inuit identity, material culture, gender, and social organization, but the nature of Inuit-animal relationships has received comparatively less attention. In addition to occupying a prominent social role, the sled dog facilitated Inuit mobility and hunting practices, but required considerable care and provisioning. In this paper, we employ carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of bulk bone collagen and amino acids to examine sled dog feeding practices between the 16th and 19th centuries. We analyze the remains of 60 archaeological dogs from six Inuit winter house sites from Labrador’s north and central coasts. While all of the dogs included in this study consumed predominantly marine-based protein, we note a degree of inter- and intrasite variation in both the carbon and nitrogen isotope values of the dogs. This variation is further explored with reference to the settlement history of Labrador, and to other stable isotope datasets from the Eastern Arctic to better understand the changing role of the dog in Inuit society.

Archaeofaunal assemblages often yield a wealth of complete bones, however, species-level identification is not possible for heavily fragmented specimens. Therefore, specific details about marine mammal utilization are often unquantified and marine species identification largely remains unverified. This paper reveals utility of ZooMS (zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry) and genetic analysis of ancient mtDNA to examine Norse uses of whales at an array of sites in Iceland and Greenland over the course of the Middle Ages (~800-1500 CE). The analysis of mtDNA and collagen collected from these sites yields new information on the importance of cetaceans and pinnipeds during this period. Comparison of samples and their suitability for mtDNA analysis also underscores the loss and degradation of genetic material in rapidly degrading Arctic contexts. With this loss, it is challenging to detect changes in marine mammal utilization and species composition through periods of climate change. Additionally, these data provide critical insight into premodern economies, and a snapshot of mammal community ecology and levels of genetic diversity prior to the advent of industrial-scale exploitation beginning in the 16th century.",1,Symposium,NA,1,Brenna,Frasier

Utilizing conceptual metaphor theory, I compare ceramic designs pre-migration in the Sand Canyon and Goodman Point Pueblo communities with designs post-migration in the Northern Rio Grande particularly at Cuyamungue and Tsama Pueblos. My research will investigate whether Tewa moieties emerged pre-migration or not.

Drawing on ideas of social landscape and the materiality of mud and masonry construction, this paper explores the cultural and sociopolitical meaning of these architectural choices. Building with both adobe and stone implies a different organization of labor than a masonry structure, and perhaps participation by a wider subset of the community. Moreover, the adobe and its extravagant use of water differentiate this building from other Chaco-era structures.

Ethnographic and ethnohistoric literature indicates that pipe-smoking was part of rituals that cemented inter-tribal trade relationships. The data from this project support the idea that pipes were used in trade negotiations and ceremonial interactions and can be proxies for examining social interaction and regional mediation aspects of trade and decision making. The blending of Plains and Pueblo pipe forms and materials suggests that there may have been a certain level of integration, alliance, or partnership in these interactions.

While paleodemographic, bioarchaeological, linguistic, and DNA evidence support a thirteenth century Mesa Verde-Northern Rio Grande migration, the lack of clear material culture evidence of this migration is perplexing. Critical to this discussion is the possibility of an earlier, tenth century migration of (presumably) Proto-Tiwa speakers from the Upper San Juan region into the Northern Rio Grande. While scholars generally agree that Proto-Tiwa split from Proto-Tewa no later than AD 1000, the location of this split, and the subsequent movement of Tiwa speakers, remain unresolved. In this presentation, I evaluate the ability of two competing hypotheses to account for the paleodemographic, linguistic, and archaeological evidence underpinning this question. The first hypothesis posits that Proto-Tiwa split from Proto-Tewa in the Upper San Juan region, which would support the idea of a Mesa Verde migration. The second hypothesis suggests a split within the Tewa Basin, which would shift the argument in favor of in situ development.

Long-term architectural and technological stability gave way to rapid change coinciding with the appearance of agricultural domesticates after AD 500. Multi-dwelling  sites and architectural investments indicate decreased residential mobility. Simultaneously, distinctions in functionally specific domestic spaces appear with the separation of cooking areas from sleeping spaces. Sweeping changes occur in subsistence technology: groundstone reflects the shift from a seed-based diet to a corn-based diet. Cooking features changed from rock-lined pits to formalized hearths. Domesticated corn required ceramics for cooking; size, shape, and location of storage features also changed rapidly. Implications for cultural continuity and in-place population growth are discussed in light of these long-term trends.

In the archaeological record, evidence of bone grease extraction is interpreted from fractured faunal remains recovered from midden deposits and thermal features. However, most archaeological studies of bone grease extraction tend to focus on subsistence to the exclusion of other uses. This preoccupation with subsistence has often led to formulations of indigenous lifeways as pure response to environmental conditions. Most notably, the idea that prehistoric bone grease processing was a response to resource stress is a topic of vigorous discussion. 
Archaeological studies of bone grease processing have mostly overlooked its other uses. For instance, bone grease was commonly mixed with ocher, charcoal, and other minerals to make grease paint for decorative, ritual and medicinal uses. Our review of ethnohistoric literature coupled with archaeological data from sites in Texas shows a strong correlation between pigment minerals and bone grease processing. This has important implications for how bone grease processing locales are understood, indicating that the rendering of grease had a function in social life that went well beyond subsistence.

However, recent evidence for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis raises the possibility of a Pleistocene era dispersal. Poor bone preservation and small populations make finding Pleistocene-era bioarchaeological evidence of the disease difficult. Coupled with this, epidemiological studies suggest that population numbers were too low for an epidemic to take hold. Reconciling the epidemiological theory with the limited bioarchaeological evidence for the disease requires a closer examination of how behavior would influence transmission. I examine this possibility and report on several agent-based models I created in R to ascertain how tuberculosis may have arisen and dispersed. I incorporate archaeological, ethnographic, and biological data in order to understand how different human cultural behaviors, such as communal hunting, and other factors may have affected the spread of tuberculosis among hunters, gatherers, and foragers.

This paper details the results of archaeological survey in the Wind River Range, Wyoming between elevations of 9,000 and 11,000 ft. The purpose of this survey was to test a predictive model of a specific site type (sites referred to as villages) created by Stirn (2014) and tested by Stirn in a different region of the same mountain range. Although the methods of creating the predictive model were not altered, the survey methods were significantly altered. Random survey blocks were created within the project area to better sample the landscape for archaeological sites. The use of GPS track logs allowed for quantification of survey intensity and highlighted areas that were not intensely surveyed. The distribution of sites and the quantified surveyed area were compared in order to rule out survey bias as a factor influencing the discovered distribution of sites. The model was not successful in discovering alpine village sites and the distribution of the newly discovered sites can be explained by survey bias. Comparison of lithic assemblages including tools and debitage indicate that the newly discovered sites and previously discovered village locations have differences in tool diversity and debitage:tool ratios, but contain similar attributes of debitage assemblages.

However, it is difficult to distinguish lithic material acquired through exchange from material acquired directly from the source. Economic models of lithic reduction suggest that material procured for the purpose of exchange may be treated differently than material procured for personal consumption. I compare obsidian source profiles and lithic reduction strategies from several dozen sites in central California that span the entire Holocene record of occupation. I find that residential mobility was likely high during the early Holocene, when it appears that obsidian procurement was embedded into the foraging round. Obsidian was probably procured logistically during the middle Holocene when residential mobility decreased. While opportunistic obsidian trade likely occurred throughout the sequence, it appears that regularized exchange via far-flung trade networks did not begin until after 1,100 cal B.P., when residential mobility reaches its lowest point.

This paper sets out results obtained following a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis of the spatial patterning of stone tools at a study area in the Colorado Desert of southern California. Stone tools are examined based on their utility for an explanation of their use and importance in the lives of prehistoric foragers. Current efforts to understand the prehistory of the region is undertaken, mostly, by environmental consultants in the private sector of archaeology as part of a formal [legal] obligation prior to large land development in the form of green energy projects. The results of such analyses seldom make it to the public as published material. This study employs an academic lens to extrapolate qualitative information from quantitative data from previously unpublished cultural resources management (CRM) investigations in the region. The application of optimal foraging theory, to this study, allows for the examination of human and environmental factors and constraints facilitating predictions and interpretations of prehistoric forager behaviors and their occurrence and frequency in the archaeological record at the study area.

One form of evidence supporting this argument is the increased use of local lithic raw materials in the Early and Middle Archaic. The utilization and retouch of unifaces and bifaces is a second form of evidence of mobility. The production of tools designed for long-term use and maintenance is associated with highly mobile groups where maximizing tool use-life reduces transport cost and reduces risk when moving into areas with little or only poor quality lithic raw material. This study  reports on the examination of changes in biface and uniface resharpening using Andrefsky’s Hafted Biface Retouch Index (2006), Kuhn’s geometric index for the reduction of unifaces (1990) and a new index for the utilization of unretouched flakes in an effort to examine the relationship between changing levels of use and mobility over time.

This view is supported by lithic analysis, including in-depth debitage analysis which identifies idiosyncratic patterns for cache blade production between sites, Minimum Analytical Nodule Analysis (MANA) for raw material use, as well as correlations of landscape utilization between wetland/upland setting between time periods.

Holly Bend, a prolific and successful early 19th century plantation owned by Robert Davidson in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina has seen multiple excavations and research over the past several years. In particular, a collection of ceramic tobacco pipe fragments that have been excavated are analyzed to better understand the local smoking culture. Several methods are used, including X-ray fluorescence spectrometer analysis to determine local sourcing of the ceramic elements, residue analysis providing plant and material content of the pipe fragments, and a pipe typology identification. Residue analysis yields late 18th and early 19th century plant and material species associated with smoking and planation life. Pipe typology identification provides the stylistic and economic elements attributed to smoking cultures.

The objects are believed to have been produced by the Apalachee Indians living in the region. However, little is known about the techniques used to manufacture them or what purpose they served. These artifacts are generally referred to as Lamar clay balls owing to some having stamped patterns similar to Lamar-like stamped pottery associated with the Apalachee missions culture. The objects are unique in the sense that they do not resemble other types of baked clay objects found in the Southeast. A recent analysis of over 300 Lamar-like objects recovered from eight different sites, combined with archival and ethnographic data, has provided information regarding their manufacturing and possible function. The results of analyses are presented in this paper.

The study focuses on ritual phenomena exhibited at two Late Mississippian Period (ca. late 1200s A.D. to A.D. 1500) settlements in southern Illinois, the Millstone Bluff site in Pope County (11Pp3) and the Dillow’s Ridge site in Union County (11U635). Millstone Bluff has been interpreted as a site of public ritual and unusual symbolic importance evidenced by its general location and topography, spatial organization, and distinctive rock art. Though Dillow’s Ridge was the locale for an inordinate level of chert tool production, in other ways the site is understood to be typical of Mississippian villages for this region and time. The sites serve, respectively, as proxies for high and low levels of public ritual phenomena. As a case study of the Late Mississippian cultures of the Ohio River Valley, this comparison of the Millstone Bluff and Dillow’s Ridge sites provides an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of current ceramic analysis methods for identifying ritual and understanding the social motivators that underlie ritualized activity.

This widespread movement of people and pots across the landscape provides a valuable context for exploring the spread of specialized technological knowledge. To better understand the production of these wares, we focused on the applied red surface on Weeden Island Red vessels, which previous analyses identified as among the most likely Weeden Island ceramics to have been locally made. In particular, we sought to define the recipe for this surface treatment, whether iron-rich ore or clay, and to identify the degree of recipe standardization across the ware type as reflection of shared production knowledge.

One such feature, a large, silo-shaped pit yielded a proportionately large number of skeletal elements identified to several species of waterbirds, a trait unique among contemporaneous sites reported within the area. The archaeological record of pre-Columbian cultures of the North American Southeast demonstrates the ritual importance of birds in the form of effigy pipes, copper and mica cutouts, and mortuary vessels that extend well into and beyond the first millennium A.D. Given the spatial and temporal relationship of Shell Mound with a large mortuary facility (Palmetto Mound), and the relationship of the faunal contents with recurring iconographic characters of this time period, the avian assemblage from Feature 25 should be expected to represent practices outside of everyday subsistence. Based upon the presence of juvenile white ibis elements, which offer a proxy for the timing of capture for this apparently ritually charged class of animal, this paper proposes the presence of waterbird elements recovered in this context represents ritualized deposition coinciding with events surrounding the summer solstice.",7,Symposium,NA,7,Joshua,Goodwin

This paper addresses these historical processes during the terminal occupation of Moundville, a multiple mound Mississippian civic-ceremonial complex occupied from A.D. 1200-1550 and located in west-central Alabama. The collapse of ancient complex societies has been proposed as a process of rapid disintegration of established practices and the loss of vital resources or sociopolitical institutions that maintained social complexity. Sudden shifts in materiality and monumentality during the fifteenth century at Moundville have been proposed as evidence for the collapse of the political order. This paper reevaluates the timing of these changes through Bayesian modeling of radiocarbon dates from stratigraphic mound midden deposits and revisits changes the production and consumption of symbolic art and monumental architecture. This paper demonstrates that while some ritual practices at Moundville changed, others were emphasized, supporting a reorganization of the social and political order around highly visible symbols and ritual objects.

AD950. As a fisher-gatherer-hunter society, they heavily exploited the shellfish and finfish resources of the estuary. During this time, Estero Bay’s estuarine ecology and coastal geomorphology developed in response to variable rates of sea-level rise (SLR) and climate change. Our work integrates archaeological and geological perspectives on this intertwined history of the Calusa and their environment. Specifically, we found correlations between shifts in estuarine salinity of the bay, as it closed, and the types of shellfish exploited by its inhabitants. As salinity lowered in the bay, favoring oyster reef productivity, the Calusa shifted away from more marine-based shellfish and to more heavily exploit oyster resources for surplus production. Concomitant with these shifts were changes in site organization and layout, which included construction and alteration of new landforms and features (e.g., canals and mounds). Estuarine conditions today are comparable to those in Calusa’s later history, but SLR acceleration threatens a shift back to the earlier estuarine ecology and geomorphology. Consequently, Calusa’s historical ecology provides insights for future environmental management of the bay.",8,Symposium,NA,8,Michael,Savarese

Drawing inspiration from the work of Ingold, I seek to find the middle ground of phenomenology, ecology, and materiality in describing how humans dwell and make their worlds among the various other communities around them. In the Lower Suwannee River Valley, Florida human and oyster communities have interacted and intersected with another for millennia. Like people, oysters dwell and build creating their Umwelt, a concept introduced by Von Uexküll. This resulted in communities numbering in the millions. When the Umwelten of oysters and people are juxtaposed, it is argued that oysters ‘anchored’ people differentially throughout the history of the region. These oyster communities are argued to represent Heideggarian Buildings, as they are locations which make sites for several coastal Umwelten, people included. Prior to 1500 BC, human communities relocated their dead to keep pace with the rising sea, emplacing oyster shell midden during the process. After an occupational hiatus, changes in human building and dwelling post 750 BC were a direct result of inhabiting an area already full of history, including past interactions with oyster beds. Florida Gulf Coast peoples in the Lower Suwannee in many ways defined themselves through relationships with the oyster communities they interacted with.

A.D. 1300, the three hundred year continuous occupation of Fox Farm, located in northern Kentucky, spans the Fort Ancient transformation (A.D. 1375-1425).  As the site grew in size during the fourteenth century, the settlement shifted from a circular to clustered arrangement of structures, to accommodate a larger population. This was accompanied by the development of a distinctive ceramic decorative tradition (deeply incised lines and punctations), coarsely serrated triangular points, chipped limestone discs, and decorated sandstone discoidals. By the late fourteenth century house size had increased, shifting from single- to multi-family dwellings. Fox Farm’s growth and its establishment as a central place within the Fort Ancient region represents a local response to the volatile cultural landscape of the late fourteenth/early fifteenth century.

Network models are analyzed to better understand how a circa 1300 A.D. in-migration of an Oneota tribal group restructured social relationships in a Mississippian chiefly environment and how communities of agents negotiated multicultural cohabitation in a region fraught with violence. A database of stylistic decorations elucidates categorical identification networks. Technological characterization data related to vessel form reveals interaction network models.

One driver may be what is known in ecology as an Allee effect, a positive relationship between population density and per capita utility. Allee effects may emerge with economies of scale such as those created by some forms of intensified food acquisition and production. Thus, in an Allee-like setting, individuals belonging to larger groups enjoy the benefits of greater efficiency and productivity of subsistence, as well as group defense, mating opportunities, cooperative parenting, etc. Here we evaluate this hypothesis by examining the process of initial plant domestication in Eastern North America, where we expect the process of intensification should co-occur with a shift from more dispersed to more clustered settlement patterns as individuals begin to benefit from aggregation. Application of the Clark-Evans Nearest Neighbor Index to dated site locations available from the Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database support our predictions, revealing a shift from dispersed to clustered settlements that coincides with the initial domestication of plants in the region.

The results establish the importance of local (Fundy) copper to pre-contact period Indigenous peoples of Nova Scotia and the Maritimes, negating the Lake Superior model.

The method usually works through the measurements of the sizes of collagen peptides following enzymatic digestion, which yield a fingerprint that can be genus or even species-specific. However, even these peptide biomarkers have been determined with a level of subjectivity, largely influenced by those most peaks that are commonly observed. In some taxa, particularly the domesticates, sequence data can be used to confirm this variation but ZooMS is being increasingly applied to a greater range of wild taxa. In the absence of sequence information, peptide biomarkers are proposed through observations from reference material, but often with less confidence. Here we apply machine learning to our assemblage of >10,000 Pin Hole Cave (Creswell Crags, UK) fragmentary Late Pleistocene microfaunal remains, demonstrating that an objective manner of biomarker determination can be achieved which builds upon those already determined manually. Most importantly, machine learning approaches appear able to rapidly identify not only known species but can reveal taxa beyond the expected, widening our knowledge of a faunal assemblage.",12,Symposium,NA,12,Michael,Buckley

Commonly called “turtlers”, 25% of the population was involved in the capture and sale of sea turtles by the late eighteenth century. Offshore reconnaissance on St. George’s Caye has led to the recovery of sea turtle remains associated with turtle corrals that were documented on a 1764 map. Per results of faunal analysis from the island, the majority of animal remains recovered belong to at least two different species of sea turtle. Turtle species varied in their preference by people as a food item, the method of capture, and their role in the economy.

ZooMS harnesses the potential of preserved collagen, the most dominant and time-stable protein in bone, to generate peptide mass spectra that are diagnostic of faunal identity. Here, ZooMS is applied to 116 fish bone samples from a ~5000 year old assemblage from the Šventoji region of Lithuania to deduce species identity and construct assemblage compositions. Identifications from ZooMS analysis uncovered incorrect morphological identifications in 14% of the fish samples analysed. Furthermore, through the analysis of over twenty different species, we demonstrate the ability to distinguish between closely diverged members of the Salmo spp. (salmon) and Scophthalmus spp. (turbot) genera; some of the taxa most frequently misidentified in this assemblage.

Using a computer model, the likelihood of accidental cultural association with animal remains (in this case proboscidean) can be estimated. In the model proboscidean remains and archaeology sites were realistically distributed on a landscape using variables from predictive modeling and the modern proboscidean ecological record to understand the frequency of coincidental spatial associations.

Rather, we view transient worker movement and labor patterns as an essential aspect of early 20th century capitalism from which a unique form of resistance emerged. The distribution of artifacts within the site (revealing patterns of behavior by occupants coming and going from the camp over time), and the modeling of the physical location of the camp in proximity to the railroad, slate quarry, creek, and town center, are necessarily conjoined spatial and temporal units, which reveal a social structure dialectically entangled with the nearby town and broader regional economy.

The composition of elements in these landscapes shows how their designers manipulated geometric forms, architectural conventions, and standardized measurements to impose order in the garden. By the end of the 18th century fashionable American gardens tended towards irregular picturesque compositions, however the arrangement of individual garden elements to achieve that effect was rooted in the established traditions of geometric regularity. The interplay between these two styles can be seen explicitly at Poplar Forest, Thomas Jefferson’s retreat and plantation in Bedford County, Virginia. Not only does the overarching structure of the designed landscape exhibit this quality but archaeological evidence also shows how geometric forms structured individual garden elements. Archaeological remains of “tree clumps”, a staple of picturesque English landscapes, reveal Jefferson’s use of various geometric forms to create a naturalistic composition. This paper will contextualize this archaeological evidence through a synthesis of period gardening treatises in Jefferson’s possession and an examination of his other designed landscapes.

Currently, immigrant workers occupy this precarious position in the United States and elsewhere. Before the great depression Hobo’s crisscrossed the road and rail ways of the U.S., taking up temporary jobs before moving on to a new location.

Previously we used a computational model to show that in principle this latter worry is unfounded, as long as we assume that the network’s topology could be transformed via community rituals and was not strongly subdivided (Froese, Gershenson, and Manzanilla 2014). Here we extend this model to investigate whether centralized hierarchy could mitigate the negative effects of strong divisions.

Scholars have advanced a wide range of theories explaining the underlying motivations and purposes of these abundant and regulated ritual massacres. As an extension of recent efforts that examine ancient Aztec sacrifice as a multi-faceted and complex system, this paper utilizes a phenomenological approach to examine the “experience” of sacrificial rituals. Using modern bio-social-psychological theory, this paper reveals that the brutal treatment of captive enemy bodies in human sacrificial rituals provided physiological, psychological, and social rewards that turned these spectacular events into a form of enthralling entertainment. Several other recompenses for officiants and other spectator-participants included a sense of security, management of anxiety, and social bonding. In addition, this paper reveals that these ceremonies incorporated different shamanic elements that fostered communally experienced “altered states of consciousness” which further contributed to physiological rewards, the reduction of social anxieties, and an increase in social solidarity. The significance of this investigation is that it offers additional explanations for the massive scale and longevity of the practice of human sacrifice amongst the ancient Aztec.

In this paper we compare access to formal lithic tools (projectile points) at two Late Postclassic sites with differing governing structures: Tlaxcallan (located in Central Mexico), and Santa Rita Corozal (located in coastal Belize). Specifically, we investigate the degree to which political-economic factors affected production and access to projectile points, including the accessibility of non-local raw materials used in their production, and their distribution among various households. We test whether households with differing social statuses monopolized or controlled finished points, and if the raw materials used to produce them varied among households on the basis of status.

Izamal was the largest of these sites by far, and connected itself to other important sites with stone causeways that stretched up to 30 km long. Ucí, located approximately 35km to the northwest of Izamal, had its own long distance causeway which linked it to three smaller sites with monumental architecture. This paper combines data from two separate, long-running archaeology projects, one focused on Izamal, the other focused on Ucí, in order to investigate political, economic, and chronological relations between the two sites. The paper compares Late Preclassic, Protoclassic, and Classic period ceramic assemblages from the two projects in order to document the degree of variation in pottery consumption. Such variation may help determine the extent of economic and political integration between Uci and Izamal, but could also be accounted for by differential access to resources, participation in divergent trade connections, or differences in chronologies of occupation.

Therefore, health through time, as well as between the sexes, presence or absence of cultural bodily modifications in relation to health, and socio-economic status were all examined within the northern Three Rivers Region study. Whereas elsewhere in the Maya region studies show dietary differences between males and females and indicate strong preferential treatment of males over females in regards to diet, the skeletal population of the northern Three Rivers Region does not exhibit such discrepancies.

Past studies have treated the murals of Teotihuacan as either literal representation of supernatural deities or as a set of signs to be translated like a language. This study concludes that there is an intermediate interpretation wherein the feathered serpent is both a god and a symbol of identity. This is found in the representations of Teotihuacanos outside of Teotihuacan and outsiders within the barrios of Teotihuacan. Thus, Mesoamerican states not only foregrounded concepts of community identity, but also actively recognized those of other polities they came into contact with.",16,Symposium,NA,16,Kathryn,Math

Outbursts determined by computer model were then compared to specific events in the Maya record to see if any correlation existed between the date of the event and the date of the outburst. The model was validated by successfully explaining several outbursts around the same epoch in the Chinese record. Some outbursts likely observed by the Maya were due to recent revolutions of Comet Halley, within a few centuries, and some to resonant behavior in older Halley trails, of the order of a thousand years.

Incised animal, architecture, hieroglyph, and human forms adorn the brick slabs of principal buildings of Comalcalco’s ceremonial core. However, their inward-facing, or concealed, orientation rendered these markings invisible. Because monumental architecture benefited from the labor of non-elites, the purposeful placement of the incised designs strongly suggests a system of messaging in their invisibility. While Comalcalco occupied a strategic location near the Grijalva River, on the edge of Maya territory, its architectural vaulting resembles that of Palenque, indicating a close relationship between the two sites. In ancient Mesoamerica the invisible or concealed wields great power and consequence; at Comalcalco this lack of visibility may be inextricably tied to its peripheral placement within Palenque’s socio-political orbit as well as the greater Maya region.

This contextual analysis identifies the anatomical and cultural attributes of the dwarf motif and interprets its meaning within the ancient Maya conception of time and their ideological integration of the natural and supernatural.

A spatial analysis of 45 depictions of short-statured individuals on archaeologically provenienced monuments reveals that the dwarf motif follows the trajectory of political power in the Maya lowlands, beginning within the Caracol-Calakmul polity and expanding with its reach. The dwarf motif appears at Tikal, in new stylistic configurations, upon its defeat of the Caracol-Calakmul alliance. Sites with flexible allegiances display the dwarf motif as a combination of local and regional stylistic elements. Evidence from small, dependent sites and regional superpowers reveals ancient Maya artists adapting broadly shared iconography to express locally the relationship between identity and power.

In addition to the presence of decorative marine shell ornaments and greenstone effigies which have been interpreted as kingly adornments, recent discoveries of additional buried offerings such as a smashed whole vessel and an uncarved stone monument suggest that this platform was the locus of important ritual activities by at least the Late Preclassic period. These activities share linkages to nearby sites in the valley, and are likely indicative of larger regional sociopolitical processes. Furthermore, our increasing understanding of the structure’s form and construction history shows that this platform required a massive investment of labor and materials, modifying the natural landscape in a truly monumental way.

Many structures have a single, clear façade, for instance, conceptualized as a literal face. Northern sites, with their toothy-jawed monster buildings, express this idea with particular directness. Stairways and sculptural adjuncts, like altars and stelae, are integral elements that contribute to the idea of facing, both literally and metaphorically, and, as such, are critical to the visual identity of many Maya sites. With a few notable exceptions, scholarly attention often focuses on isolating and analyzing associated texts and patronage as they relate to dynastic agendas, historical chronologies, or infrastructure supporting elaborate ceremonies. The present work acknowledges the importance, and interrelated nature, of Northern Lowland plaza features like stairs, altars, and three-dimensional sculpture. In doing so, we begin to explore how discrete formatting choices, combined with object selection and placement, impact viewers’ spatial experiences. Ultimately our work strongly supports the reading of Maya architecture as a performative framework.

Archaeological research at Oxpemul reflects occupation continuity from the Formative through Classic periods.  However, hieroglyphic inscriptions indicate a late fluorescence in the mid to late eighth century.  This paper explains this seeming contradiction from the perspective of broader geopolitical dynamics, particularly the rivalry between Calakmul and Tikal. Unlinke other centers in Uxte’tuun, the dynastic history of Oxpemul is silent during the height of the Kaanul (Snake) Dynasty during the ‘Three Kings Period’ (AD 635-730), when Calakmul exerted direct rulership over subordinate kingdoms in Uxte’tuun. This could reflect either stagnation and decline, or a later rewriting of history following major political upheaval in the region. Following the decline of the Snake Dynasty, Oxpmeul undertook a major campaign of monument construction, with kings holding both the local ‘stone throne’ and the enigmatic ‘bat head’ emblem glyph. These data indicate that Oxpemul benefitted from the decline of its more powerful neighbor and rose to regional preeminence under the aegis of Tikal.

While several recent studies have shown correlations between increased temperatures and conflict on the time-scale of years to decades, correlations over such short-term timescales may be misleading. The effects of anthropogenic climate change will likely go on for centuries and we know that long-term effects can be substantially different from short-term ones. Therefore, it is important that we investigate the century-scale effects of increasing temperature on conflict levels. With this in mind, we analyzed three long-term historical conflict records—one from the Classic Maya region, one from Europe, and one from China, each spanning multiple centuries. Using a recently developed time-series regression method, we compared each conflict record to several regional temperature reconstructions. We found clear evidence for a positive relationship in the Classic Maya case, but our results were more complicated for the other two cases.

Joya de Ceren is a village of commoners that was buried by the Loma Caldera eruption, which occurred around AD 650; it is one of the most studied ancient villages in Mesoamerica. Moreover, the previous study indicate that this village might have been closely connected to San Andres, which is the religious, political, and economic center in the region. However, due to limited research, the extent of control of the elite of San Andres over the commoners of Joya de Ceren remains unclear. Therefore, the author recently conducted an archaeological investigation at San Andres. The results revealed that in San Andreas, the major occupation and construction of public architecture developed after the Loma Caldera eruption. In other words, San Andres might not have been a regional center at the time of Joya de Ceren. In addition, based on these findings, the interpretation of the Joya de Ceren commoners and the nature of interaction between regional centers of the elite and villages of commoners can be reconsidered.",18,Symposium,NA,18,Akira,Ichikawa

However, most models of exchange, migrations, or identities rely on samples from Southern Veracruz, the Usumacinta, and the southern Isthmus without considering the vast Chontalpa in-between. This paper synthesizes new and old data on sites, intrasite spatial organization, and material culture from the Mezcalapa Delta for a synopsis on prehispanic settlement history, settlement patterns, and interpretations on intra- and interregional identities in the Western Chontalpa. These sources suggest low populations during Olmec times, growth in the Late Formative, a hiatus in the Early Classic, and significant growth in the Middle-Late Classic when the first states appeared. The greatest political centralization was in the coastal-levee transition zone, without significant incorporation in trade networks, suggesting a tributary economy focused on diverse local resources. The people of the region cannot be viewed as Olmec, Chicanel, Maya, Nahua or their subjects. Instead, changing local to interregional layers of cultural identities are interpreted for Formative to Late Classic times, which in the latter were variably negotiated by class.

Olmec Jade Artifacts as Elite Tools, Ornaments, and Inalienable Goods",Mesoamerica: Gulf Coast,Olmec,Experimental Archaeology,Social and Political Organization,"Recent research has re-identified certain enigmatic Gulf Coast Olmec greenstone artifacts as elite versions of textile-making tools. These artifacts, which include Middle Formative picks, figural celts, clamshell and plaque pendants, and objects designated as “spoons,” were likely used by elites as both functional objects and high-status adornment, as illustrated in the contemporary sculpture. Most examples of these artifacts are found in caches and graves of distant and/or later civilizations, apparently after they had experienced long use-lives; while still identifiable, most are extensively reworked and could no longer function as tools, becoming primarily symbolic—or their symbolism had been co-opted and transformed through recarving and recycling. Analysis of the few examples found in Formative period graves reveals considerable use-wear and breakage, re-sharpening, and reshaping; some were reworked to the point where they are barely recognizable, apparently retired only after they were largely unidentifiable. Such find contexts suggest that these artifacts functioned as inalienable goods—revered, elite possessions that were reserved, inherited, and treasured as symbols of association and status. Perhaps even more significant, the fact that these tools also served as status symbols suggests that in these Formative societies, social status could be gained through personal agency as well as heritage.",19,Symposium,NA,19,Billie,Follensbee

In 2017, we began our first season of excavations at Jahuay, with the goal of investigating EH coastal subsistence strategies as well as the sociopolitical role of the site within the larger Topará sphere. We recovered an array of materials, including ceramics, botanic remains, marine shell, faunal bone, and textile. Our initial results suggest the people occupying Jahuay during the EH primarily exploited maritime resources, but also had access to a wide array agricultural goods including squash, peanuts, beans, and cotton.

Leland Locke demonstrated in the 1920s that Inka khipu knots often have standard numerical values. However, non-numerical Inka khipu signs remain elusive and undeciphered. Recent work by Gary Urton, however, has identified Inka khipus and individual khipu cords with knots that do not obey the standard numerical rules Locke identified. May Inka khipu knots also have had a non-numerical semiotic function?
Here, I use the Harvard Khipu Database, Python statistical libraries, and Benford’s Law to evaluate this claim and potentially identify a non-numerical Inka khipu sign unit. Specifically, I compare knot value frequencies in extant Inka khipus to those expected in a numerical dataset, as predicted by Benford’s Law. Benford’s Law is used to identify fraud in a variety of disciplines--providing numerical frequencies that are characteristic of a set of empirically observed numerical values as a point of comparison. Thus, if knot value frequencies diverge severely from Benford’s Law expectations for any set of khipus, these khipu knots likely functioned as non-numerical signs.",22,Symposium,NA,22,Jon,Clindaniel

What is the inspiration for these myths? How do they relate to taphonomic processes that affect deceased organisms? This paper addresses these questions in an Andean context by comparing pre-Hispanic narratives of lithification to post-mortem biological processes. In the Andes, tales of lithification focus on ancestors and local heroes, who, in their petrified state, continue to interact with the living by mediating between their descendants and supernatural deities. Ethnographies and ethnohistories describe large upright stones (huancas) and natural stone formations (huacas) who received the same care from their descendants as mummified ancestral remains and contextual evidence has allowed examples of modified and unmodified stone huancas to be identified in the archaeological record. The equivalency in the treatment of huancas and mummified ancestors raises interesting questions regarding the conceptual relationship between stone and the dead. One possible explanation argues Andean people were motivated to create this association by the desire to transfer qualities of stone (durability) to their ancestors. However, processes of lithification (fossilization) are not purely abstract mythologies. Could Andean beliefs regarding lithification also represent a compressed and abstracted interpretation of taphonomic processes?",22,Symposium,NA,22,Melissa,Litschi

Specifically, this paper explores the relationship between two Chancay sites in the Huanangue Valley, Cerro Blanco and Salitre, to argue that the Chancay complexity may have developed out of a resource sharing system that was created as part of a local level responses to environmental challenges.

The thinness of the literature on sustainable archaeological site management may pertain to the difficulty heritage managers have in articulating frameworks as advocated for in the prevailing decolonization and indigenous theory underpinning heritage-based sustainability efforts.

One of the results of the encounter between indigenous and Spanish cultures is the syncretism that developed in the art and religious architecture of this region. Studies of syncretic art in colonial Mexico primarily focus on art produced in major convents built in previous pre-Hispanic cities and/or in new towns of New Spain. However, much less is known about the small indigenous towns or pueblos de indios beyond the cities states, cabeceras or major towns. How did they respond to their new circumstances? This study reveals how Tlanalapan - a Texcoco tributary town in pre-Hispanic times, an Indian town during the Colonial period in the New Spain, and an agricultural-industrial town today in the central highlands of Mexico - not only adopts and adapts to the new circumstances, but also uses the syncretic art of a Franciscan church facade, a crucifix made of corn, and local traditions as instruments to negotiate its own identity.",24,Symposium,NA,24,Maria,Stapleton

In central and south Texas, a distinct archaeological culture, Toyah, spans some 400 years, 1250-1650 CE. The hallmark projectile point and first systemic, locally-produced ceramic tradition in the area have intrigued archaeologists for over a hundred years; interpretations of the phenomena have been unsatisfactory as to the factors responsible for such a distinctive change in material culture within a foraging society. This paper argues that feasting theory provides an interpretative and explanatory lens for Toyah. With increasing population pressure on the landscape, interactions between foraging and farming groups across southern North America increased during the late Pre-Hispanic period. Large feasts, which the Spanish called mitotes, become important social mechanisms for crucial intergroup meetings for trade as well as political, marriage, and spiritual negotiations.

The data show that, contrary to typical expectations, frequencies of elaborate indigenous Mixtec polychrome serving wares rise considerably from the Postclassic to the Early Colonial period, rather than these ceramics being replaced by European style ceramics. Nevertheless, residents of Achiutla did indeed have access to European glazed wares, and used tin-enameled majolicas with considerable frequency, in particular. I attribute this pattern to indigenous nobles having served as primary interlocutors between Spanish authorities and their broader native constituencies following the social upheaval of the Conquest. As such, they would have negotiated with and attempted to appease the demands of both of these different groups simultaneously. I suggest that the ceramic patterning indicates they did so in part through commensal politics, entertaining these various groups at feasting events.

This paper presents the results of the 2017 test excavations of a sample of the A plaza buildings. Maya plazas are typically conceived of as large open places for ritual and political performance. However, these excavation findings suggest that this period was not static, and city occupants reworked their relationships to the monumental site core by reconfiguring the layout of the main plaza and reusing materials from earlier buildings. These practices of reconfiguration and reuse likely even continue into the later part of the Postclassic period. This paper considers how this transitional period at the site fits in with trends of reuse and reconfiguration throughout northern Belize and parts of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula during a period of instability and change across the Maya lowlands.

For over a century, dozens of researchers have proposed different causes that may have driven this complex process. The last few decades have witnessed the academic community’s opinion converge on the notion that many different social and environmental factors, operating at likewise diverse scales, somehow contributed to a temporally gradual and spatially heterogeneous disruption of the demographic, political, and cultural patterns known to have characterized the Classic Maya. This paper builds on this progress by attempting to quantify the relative influence of certain factors on the Maya region's long-term trajectory. It presents an abstract spatial simulation model of Maya demography, subsistence, and trade over a 3000 year period. It implements relatively generic manifestations of what processes were relevant to the growth, collapse, and regeneration of the Maya system. This abstraction permits quicker model execution times, which then facilitates using data mining and sensitivity analysis methodology to quantify how certain stressor categories contribute to the presence or absence of long term societal collapse. The relative importance of these stressors according to the simulation is then compared to the amount of research attention they tend to receive.

This examination also reveals how Aztec and Huastec depictions of, and reactions to, male nudity indicate how both cultures use shared ideas of gender and identity to address unique social and political concerns within each group. Ideas of maleness reflected in these sculptures reveal the anxiety of the Aztecs as relative newcomers trying assert themselves as a cosmic and political center of the Mesoamerican world while at the same time solidly giving the Huastec a home in that world.

Bone collagen (n= 17) and bone and enamel apatite (n=21) isotopic data provide C, N, and O values describing diet and breastfeeding patterns. Carbon values suggest a narrow diet heavily based on maize and little animal protein. Individuals between 0-3 year of age had significantly higher nitrogen and oxygen values than adults, suggesting that these infants may have still been breastfeeding at the time of death. Weaning likely occurred between 3-6 years of age when C3 foods, perhaps squash, were introduced in the weaning diet. By 6 years of age isotopic values matched those of adults. Alternatively, since the subadults in the sample are those who did not survive into adulthoold, their elevated nitrogen and more negative carbon values may be attributed to severe stress prior to death. Therefore, we also consider the proportion of adults versus subadults recovered from different periods of occupation at Cerro Jazmín as well as pathological and traumatic lesions to discuss broader patterns of infant health and mortality.",26,Symposium,NA,26,Veronica,Perez Rodriguez

Though the doctrine “as in life, so in death” can have some merit for archaeological inquiry, viewing mortuary ritual in this manner ignores the social act itself, which is one of the most intimate, personal, and weighted actions humans produce, serving, among other roles, to return the society to homeostasis in the wake of the loss of a member. In interpreting mortuary ritual as a means to resolve a social death within a group, close ties emerge with ethnic and group identity. Rather than a passive reflection of a culture in life, mortuary ritual is an act constitutive of ethnicity.
This paper examines inhumation practices at Monte Albán in the Oaxaca Valley from ca. 500 BCE until Spanish conquest, traditionally periodized as Monte Albán I-V.

Although Mesoamerican archaeology has largely evidence about representations of aging in different sources of information (textual and iconographic) to a broader consideration of funerary practices, approaches of old age as an identity category has been neglected of the archaeological inquiry. This article explores the funerary practices of elderly at Monte Alban and how it contributes to the understanding about the longevity in the past and the attributions based on age in the context of the organization of the domestic labor in complex societies. Aged bodies were selected considering pathologies and markers of senescence that include, for example, joint diseases, osteoporosis, traces of wear and tooth loss (n=40; 12,1%). Some symbolical aspects of longevity were introduced in the funerary practices to give meanings to the preservation of the memory of the house. Equally, older people are engaged in occupational specializations of the residential group, as ceramic production and trade of prestige goods, throughout the time of occupation of the site.",26,Symposium,NA,26,Soraya,Alencar

",Bronze Age,Bioarchaeology/Skeletal Analysis,Gender and Childhood,"The Early Bronze Age (EBA) is often characterized as a period of emerging social hierarchies dominated by high status warrior-males. Analysis of human skeletal remains in their mortuary context has the potential to challenge this assumption and inform more nuanced understandings of gender and social status. Individuals (n=285) at the EBA Maros cemetery at Ostojicevo, Serbia (ca. 1900-1500 B.C.E.) exhibit a strong correlation between biological sex and funerary treatment, specifically body orientation. Among the subset of adult (>18 years-at-death) biological males buried in a “female” orientation, several stand out for either their unique physical characteristics (e.g., tall stature, robusticity), or association with “female” prestige offerings (e.g., copper pins, beaded sashes). The relationship between “masculinity” and social status is further complicated by gendered differences in the social perception and embodiment of physical trauma. While there is an association between trauma, male orientation, and weaponry, most individuals with skeletal evidence of antemortem or perimortem trauma did not receive special funerary treatment. Through the examination of multiple lines of evidence, including grave goods, orientation, and evidence of trauma, this paper argues that transgenderism seems to have been as highly regarded as other elements of traditional “masculine” identities at Ostojicevo.",26,Symposium,NA,26,Katherine,Pompeani

Ceramic figurines from the sites of Teotihuacan, Axotlan, Cerro Portezuelo, and Huixtoco are used to explore how elements of gender were constructed and communicated in the region over the course of a millennium, and how these practices underwent a radical transformation during the emergence and expansion of the Teotihuacan state. The selection and combination of sexual attributes and decorative elements such as clothing and jewelry were changeable strategies for depicting social identity. In contrast to earlier methods for depicting feminine and masculine bodies, Teotihuacan period figurines emphasized decorative cultural attributes over physical ones—a strategy that quickly spread to rural communities in the region.

Several key debates in the Palaeolithic have their roots in basic issues related to chronology; did the Aurignacian predate the Chatelperronian in some regions of Europe? When did Neanderthals disappear? How long did anatomically modern humans (AMH) and Neanderthals overlap, and what implications did this have for interaction, acculturation or interbreeding?

A magnetic anomaly has been identified close to a cluster of artifacts. Micromorphological analyses indicate site formation processes with relatively little post-depositional modification. This is further supported by fabric analysis. The site is one of the earliest known sites, to date, with evidence for an association of fire and human activity.

",Other,Lithic Analysis,Caves and Rockshelters,"Lithic miniaturization, the systematic production of small stone artifacts by controlled fracture, was a pervasive feature of late Pleistocene lithic technology. Smaller toolkits enabled humans to exploit raw materials more efficiently, to produce composite tools more effectively, to reduce a wider range of rocks, and to increase mobility by lightening toolkits. These benefits allowed humans to occupy a wider range of ecological niches. Archaeologists working in southern Africa have long acknowledged lithic miniaturization’s importance in framing the region’s late Pleistocene prehistory. However, to date archaeologists have conducted very little inter-region comparative research on the topic. This paper presents the results of a comparative lithic technological study between Klipfonteinrand and Sehonghong- two large rock-shelters located in southern Africa’s winter and summer rainfall zones respectively. Evidence from these sites shows not only a comparative technological approach’s effectiveness but also that lithic miniaturization expresses itself differently in different regions. Patterned variability of this nature fits a model of strategic behavioral variability. To gauge variability in prehistoric lithic miniaturization, archaeologists need to adopt more contextual and comparative methods of stone tool analysis.

",Paleolithic,Zooarchaeology,Migration,"Work in the Nefud Desert, Saudi Arabia, has been fundamental for establishing the importance of the Arabian Peninsula for Pleistocene hominin populations and their dispersals out of Africa. Recent palaeontological and archaeological exploration in the Western Nefud Desert has uncovered numerous fossiliferous palaeolake deposits and associated archaeology. Fossil assemblages include taxa with both African and Eurasian affinities and indicate a greater diversity in large mammals than resides in the region today. Furthermore, the presence of species such as Hippopotamus and Alcelaphus strongly support an ameliorated climate with expansive grasslands and large, perennial lakes. Favourable conditions likely permitted and promoted an influx of taxa, while subsequent climatic deterioration would have resulted in faunal retreat and/or extirpation. The presence of hominins in Arabia during the Pleistocene is evidenced by fossil remains, stone tools and anthropogenically modified bone, and their dispersal into Arabia was most likely tied to the establishment of favourable conditions and concomitant influx of large herbivores. This is perhaps best exemplified by the relatively diverse large mammal assemblage at Ti’s al Gadah (TAG) and the accompanying evidence for anthropogenically modified bone from various fossiliferous deposits, suggesting repeated hominin dispersal events into the Western Nefud Desert during the Pleistocene.",27,Symposium,NA,27,Mathew,Stewart

Recent excavations in the hominin-bearing layers of Block 2 at Dmanisi have revealed a complex underlying basalt formation that likely dictated much of the site formation processes, both biotic and abiotic. Combining spatial patterning with a 3D model of the excavation generated using Agisoft Photoscan, we identify several areas where the basalt, and the pseudo-karstic pipe and gully formations, have constrained the deposition of material. 3D bone orientations in many areas show strong correlations to the underlying shape of the basalt formation. In addition, spatial patterning of the lithic and faunal material differs depending on stratigraphic layer, which is also controlled largely by the basalt and pipe/gully formations.

Sociopolitical Strategies in Northwestern Scandinavia in the Early Bronze Age,Europe: Northern Europe,Bronze Age,Other,Social and Political Organization,"Along the northwestern coast of Scandinavia the reliance and utilisation of the sea set the stage for a more advance sociopolitical organization. The technological innovations prompted by the Late Neolithic (i.e. ship technology), turned the sea into a connective arena of interaction and trade. This is seen with the widespread distribution of finely crafted Jutish flint daggers from Late Neolithic I, followed by a steady increase of metal, burial mounds, and settlement sites in Late Neolithic II and the Early Bronze Age. Despite having a material culture expressive of a region well-integrated within a Nordic World System, these societies are juxtaposed by a long coastline of climatic and ecological distinctiveness that forces insular practices in subsistence and organization. This paper will explore the contrasting practices in sociopolitical organization and the strategies implemented to take advantage of the local resource potential.

Metals from this region helped fuel the rise of inequality across Europe during Late Prehistory, and the area is also home to a rich mortuary record, with archaeological survey identifying over one hundred mounded tomb cemeteries belonging to Bronze Age communities. However, none of these cemeteries have been fully excavated and only a small sample of skeletons have been studied. Here, we describe the results of bioarchaeological analysis of human skeletal remains from a sample of previously unanalyzed Early Bronze Age sites that encompass a significant degree of environmental and cultural variability, including upland cemeteries with stone-covered cairns, as well as lowland cemeteries with earthen cairns. These cemeteries show evidence of diverse mortuary treatments, including primary burials, secondary burials, and commingled interments. Our analyses assess age, sex, health, and funerary treatment, providing preliminary information about how mortuary treatment intersected with aspects of identity and lived experience. This study builds a foundation for future bioarchaeology in the Apuseni region and emphasizes the need to supplement osteological analysis of the scant museum collections with larger-scale excavation of cemeteries.",28,Symposium,NA,28,Jess,Beck

",Bronze Age,Mortuary Analysis,Mortuary Archaeology,"Mortuary variability in European prehistory has long been perceived through the lens of Christian worldview from which the discipline of archaeology originally developed. Expectations rooted in this conceptual perspective inevitably shaped the ways how the archaeological record was approached and interpreted. As a case study we consider the Central European Bronze Age, on which we can deconstruct the traditional ‘textbook’ understanding of ancient funerary traditions. During this period, general development observed in formal cemeteries is characterised by the gradual shift from prevailing inhumation towards cremation, but with strikingly frequent finds of complete, partial, or disarticulated human skeletons in settlement pits and ditches.  We argue that what is usually regarded as a normative burial, or its opposite, i.e. seemingly careless and non-ritual deposition of human remains, may be a very problematic categorization. Gradually accumulated evidence suggests that the most visible forms of human burial in the archaeological record may not have been the dominant type of treatment of the dead. According to our research, secondary manipulation and fragmentation of human bodies, which was turning them into objects of cultural patrimony that could be shared and curated, seems to have been the most frequent destiny awaiting the deceased.",28,Symposium,NA,28,Ladislav,Smejda

It is relatively straightforward to determine the proportional representation and mortality profiles of the major species – cattle, sheep/goat and pig. While this provides insights into how and why animals were managed, it does not allow the detailed investigation of how individual animals were actually kept, how they were moved around the landscape, and how various nearby communities integrated their animal management practices.

Viking colonization led to rapid deforestation of woodland resources, resulting in soil loss and increased aeolian deposition.

Historical texts also record that high-status Irish monks and nuns traveled throughout Ireland, Scotland, England, and continental Europe.

This paper uses ArcGIS, isotopic studies, and multivariate statistics to investigate the relationship between where people came from, where they chose to bury their dead, and what they sent with them. My preliminary analysis of data from more than 9,000 burials in over 100 cemetery populations indicates that changes in burial practices were the result of a larger shift from a society based upon Britain’s relationship with the Roman Empire to one based upon its local communities, whether composed of natives, or newcomers, or both. No matter where people came from, no two communities reacted to the upheaval of the fifth century in the same way, and there were no monolithic or universal ways of relating the past to the present and future. New practices appeared, and old practices continued, some of which were better suited to some fifth-century inhabitants of Britain than others.",30,Symposium,NA,30,Janet,Kay

Working with modern communities to interpret the past is a valuable technique that can reveal different ways of doing that may not have originally occurred to the investigator. This paper shows how the assistance and guidance of carpenters living and working in Cairo’s City of the Dead has enabled a more nuanced and realistic view of ancient woodworking practices.

This paper aids in complicating these views by emphasizing how recent understandings of network theory and materiality shift the portrait of complexity from one of linear progression to one of social disconnection. More specifically, this paper explores how current ideas of materiality inherently flip our value system for how societies may be complex – so that bigger is not necessarily better, but the result of peoples attempts to deal with isolation, alienation, disconnection, and sometimes social instability.

A step trench on the southern slope of the site verified the presence of LC 1-2 (4800/4500-3850 B.C.E.) and LC 3-5 (3850-3100 B.C.E.) occupation levels. This paper will discuss the data collected and provide interpretations on the implication of the Late Chalcolithic period in the Qara Dagh Valley. The presence of stone tools, particularly obsidian, and the strategic position of Ban Qala on a corridor that leads east to the Shahrizor plain and west to Chamchamal, could suggest that the site participated in some form of trade.

",Bronze Age,Other,Social and Political Organization,"During the Late Chalcolithic (c. 4500-3100 BCE), the lowlands and highlands of southwest Asia became increasingly entangled both economically and culturally. Interaction during this time was organized through a network of colonial enclaves and diasporas.

Scholarly discourse posits that only after centuries of isolation and impoverishment there came a phase of renewed social complexity and interregional interaction during the second half of the third millennium BCE. However, while distinct cultural zones following the Late Chalcolithic display only very little contact in material culture, limited evidence suggests continued interregional exchange structured along very differently principles.

This Zagros Interaction Sphere facilitated social and economic ties across dispersed communities inhabiting different ecological zones. These highland-lowland interactions characterize an alternative development of social complexity resulting in the formation of indigenous polities and ethnic identities that are often characterized as peripheral and small-scale to wider developments in Bronze Age southwest Asia.

",Bronze Age,Zooarchaeology,Ritual and Symbolism,"In this presentation, we will examine rituals of hunting and feasting in Late Bronze Age Tel Ifshar, a medium-size 4 ha site on Israel’s coastal plain. The Late Bronze Age in Israel was a time of social change as Egyptian influence—political, cultural, and religious—steadily increased in intensity, and became more and more entangled with the local Canaanite culture. At Ifshar, we have evidence for the phenomenon of feasting in the archaeological record through ceramics and faunal remains, and suggest viewing this activity as part of vertical patrimonial relationship in which the client gained capital and the patron reinforced the bond over the client. It has been argued, that ritualized feasting and conspicuous consumption played a significant role in maintaining the patrimonial system that is currently theorized to have been employed in Canaan. However, this role has mainly been discussed in relation to large sites and focused on the relationships between peers. This presentation seeks to shed light on the phenomenon of feasting and hunting at smaller, mid-level sites and what that could mean in the context of Canaanite society.

Resuloglu, dated to the Early Bronze Age (ca. 2500–2100 BC), is one of the few Hatti sites being systematically excavated. The site, located on a hilltop near the Delice River, consists of a cemetery area and settlement that spreads over two opposing–once connected–ridges with numerous extraordinary metal and vitreous artifacts. The settlement exemplifies well the self-sustaining pre-Hittite societies in the Halys basin.
This research focuses on the Early Bronze Age metal and vitreous artifacts at Resuloglu to understand the production technologies by combining archaeometric methods with archaeological theories about integrated crafts. While comparing and contrasting the technology and raw material exploitation at Resuloglu with the available local and regional data, we will also present the results of the new ongoing survey at the region. By using the archaeometric and survey results of Resuloglu, we would like to bring a fresh look to theories of possible local production(s) region and trade relations of Hatti before the Hittite Kingdom emerges.

",Bronze Age,Bone Tool Analysis,Material Culture and Technology,"This paper investigates the production of bone artifacts during the Bronze Age (ca. 3000-1200 BCE) at the central Anatolian site of Kaman-Kalehöyük. At this time, small agrarian societies transformed into more complex polities and states, which gave way to a more centralized and specialized market economy. These transformations in sociopolitical and economic organization resulted in other changes as well. For example, animal exploitation patterns began to reflect a more regulated economy to meet food production, distribution, and consumption demands. Urbanized food management systems also had to meet the demands of craftspeople and specialist, if any, who might have preferred certain skeletal elements over others. In a rural site like Kaman-Kalehöyük, craftspeople, in particular, would use bone as raw materials readily and constantly available for production purposes. More specifically, we seek to elucidate whether preferences for specific bone elements reflect changes in the demands for consumer goods such as game pieces, jewelry, furniture inlays, archer’s thumb rings, bone shaft looms, and needles. More broadly, we aim to test whether there are correlations between changes in sociopolitical and economic organization and production of bone tools through time.

",Bronze Age,Digital Archaeology: Simulation and Modeling,Environment and Climate ,"Agent-based modeling of land use not only illustrates how ancient production mechanisms evolve but such models also have the power to reconstruct changes in spatio-temporal changes in the dynamics of surface processes in relation with the changes in climatic conditions and varying type and intensity of human land use. Early Bronze Age-I at Arslantepe represents a time period when the paleoclimatic dynamics changed towards more arid conditions while the economy of the site shifted from intensive irrigation farming to site-tethered pastoralism. Concurrently, the social organization moved from hierarchic to heterarchic structure. Extensive geoarchaeological research around the site suggests low rate of sediment deposition for this phase. Under more arid climatic conditions, it is expected that various modes of land use would have different impacts on the surface processes. The results of numerous scenarios tested in agent-based models at Arslantepe during the Early Bronze Age-I show that the rates of erosion and deposition change as patterns of precipitation and the mode of land use change. The results of simulations prove that the shift in economic and social organization alleviated the environmental disturbance that the residents of Arslantepe were faced with at the onset of the Middle Holocene.

Increasing quantity of air and space-borne imagery available to archaeologists and advances in computational science has created an emerging interest in automated archaeological detection.

In the last few years, tremendous success has been achieved in image recognition through deep learning, a category of supervised machine learning which is based on hierarchical representation learning. We have chosen to examine the application of deep convolutional neural networks for automated archaeological detection focusing on qanats. The methodological merit of the project is that qanat shafts are one of the most suitable archaeological features for pattern recognition. The analytical merit is that conducting comparative studies of qanat systems at a regional scale is predicated on mapping massive number of qanat shafts, which is impossible manually.

It presents that large-scale projects and dependence on the centralized political authority were not always agriculturally required and a different intensification strategy with the integration of both irrigation and rain-fed practices could sustain a growing population.

",Other,Survey,Environment and Climate ,"Recent research in the borderlands have increased our knowledge on the irrigation systems and urbanization plans of the Sasanian Empire in the late antiquity. In particular, surveys and excavations in the Mughan Steppe indicate that irrigation canals connected nearly all Sasanian settlements. Evidence suggests that after the 7th century AD most of the elaborate settlement system was abandoned and its irrigation infrastructure went out of use. While the exact date of this abandonment is unclear, it is possible that the collapse of the irrigation system itself could have brought an end to the Sasanian settlements which happened before appearing of the Muslim army in the region in the mid-7th century. In this paper, I will present evidence of climate change that could have caused the abandonment of the Sasanian irrigation systems and associated settlements. Unlike a popular explanation of the decline of the Near East and the role of Islam, the evidence suggest that the climate change could have contributed significantly to the collapse of the Sasanian settlements before the arrival of Muslims.

Based on the analysis, it is highly possible that the decrease of mobility is an adaptive response to the environment changes of early Holocene and is correlated with food resource intensification. In southern part of North China, the decrease of mobility and the transition towards the sedentary life stimulate the development of food production, while in northern part of North China such transition contributes to the establishment of intensified hunting-fishing-gathering economy.

This approach is crucial to understanding the sociopolitical evolution of community organization and status variability involved in the emergence of the communal cemetery.

",Bronze Age,Use-Wear Analysis,Social and Political Organization,"Processed from turtle shells and bovid scapulae, oracle bones were massively exploited by the ruling house of the late Shang Dynasty for divination. As opposed to traditional scholarship that holds primary interest in inscriptions engraved on these bones, I consider late Shang divination in entirety as a technological process that proceeds from the preparation and delivery of bone material via tributary networks all the way to bones’ after-use discard into pits. By switching the attention to the least examined pre-divination and post-divination stages, I focus on the texts of marginal inscriptions, the data of the used turtle plastrons and the records of stratigraphy recovered from Pit YH127 and Pit H3 at Yinxu. I argue that since regional tribute payers, capital scribes and diviners were made bound by the tributary networks of oracle turtles, their major behavioral patterns that aimed to facilitate the provision of turtle shells for divination would have been “recorded” by the altered materiality of the shells at each step of change. To detect and reconstruct such behavioral patterns and the physicality of divination can deepen our understandings of the groups that attended the industry of oracle bones, and thus the nature of oracle bones as well.

Although badly robbed, the excavations of the tombs yielded rich grave good assemblages, allowing archaeologists to approach to various elements of the theocratic authority of the late Shang kings. The reconstruction of the formation process of the cemetery has been attempted in the hope that the tombs can be assigned to the kings whose reigns are recorded in Shiji and in Zhúshu Jìnián (the Bamboo annals).  Drawing upon an original novel reconstruction of the relative chronology of the tombs, we examined spatial relationships between them at each phase of the formation process of the cemetery, particularly in terms of which pre-existing tombs the mourners were ‘designed’ to see and in what way, and have analytically revealed some distinct patterns. By comparing the timings of the implementations of those strategies with the genealogical relationships between the kings that were recorded in Shi-ji, we have investigated and reconstructed the social-strategic implications of the selections of those strategies in relation to their historical-contextual backgrounds.

",Historic,Mortuary Analysis,Mortuary Archaeology,"One major shift in mortuary practices that happened over the Han dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE) China, from burying bronze/pottery vessels to burying miniaturized architectural models, was usually explained as a result of the contemporary ideology of “treating the dead as alive”, or as a reflection of the social-economic transformation. While these previous interpretations invariably presumed that artifacts were passive representations and projections of ideological/social conditions of their contemporary people, the current paper intends to show the active roles of artifacts by shifting the main question from “what did grave goods represent or reflect” to “how did they influence people and what were their effects”. To do this, the paper first demonstrates that the material context created by existing pottery vessel styles was crucial for the emergence of granary terracotta as the earliest type of miniaturized architectural model; then it discusses how the newly invented granary models, by evoking the cognitive concept of miniaturism through their concrete material forms, resulted in a new category of grave goods being made and popularized, and eventually transformed people’s tomb practices. Thus artifacts should be seen as actively participating in social processes, influencing how people interact with and understand their world.

",Iron Age,Cultural Resources and Heritage Management,Urbanism,"Mongolia is well known for its history of nomadic pastoralism and Bronze and Early Iron Age burials and monuments. It wasn’t until later in the Iron Age that the first large fortified towns and urban centers were built by the Uygher and Khitan Khanates. One of these, Baibalyk is believed to have been established in 758 CE by the Uyghur khagan, Bayanchur Khan, as a ceremonial and trading center in the fertile and strategically located Selenge Valley. Later in the 17th Century, Baibalyk is known to have been the site of a Buddhist monastery. Although prominent on the Mongolian landscape, Baibalyk has received little systematic attention from archaeologists. To address this deficiency, members of the Mongolian International Heritage Team have recently begun a long-term program of investigation to gain a better understanding of the role centers such as Bai Balik played in a nomadic pastoral economy. Preliminary investigation suggests Baibalyk has had a long history of use including Uyghur, Mongolian Empire, Buddhist, and recent historical occupation.

These discrepancies have been attributed to the ‘reservoir effect’. In order to investigate this, we analyzed and dated both human and animal remains from three Xiongnu period 'ring' burials in northwestern Mongolia – the so-called periphery of the Xiongnu Empire. Given this region has many lakes and that isotopically “heavy” d13C-values have been detected in cases from other regions of Mongolia, it is possible that fishing played a more important role than previously thought in the subsistence economy of some Xiongnu period pastoralists.

Absence of written documents from Bronze Age Central Asia severely limits the application of such theories. The nature of the Bronze Age civilization of Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) in Central Asia, and its dispersion to neighboring NE Iran has been a long-lasting question in study of Prehistoric Western Asia. This paper aims to examine the BMAC presence in NE Iran, using Tepe Hissar as a case study, to understand how BMAC interacted with local cultures in this region. The evidence for existence of BMAC in NE Iran and the nature and extent of BMAC’s dispersion out of Central Asia is revisited from the perspective of frontier and borderland studies. The goal of this paper is to identify different types of borderland processes that occured in NE Iran, where these two cultures came into contact. In order to hypothesize about this interaction sphere, I turn to borderland theories, specifically the “continuum of boundary dynamics” and “borderland matrix” models in order to conceptualize the material culture evidence for BMAC in Iran as markers of various borderland processes.

This proposed model provides a hypothesis which is tested in a geographic information system (GIS) through the geostatistical analysis of regional settlement patterns and the distribution of village sites across the landscape at multiple scales. Through modelling clustering and dispersion of village sites across the landscape, the evaluation of central places and authority in Palau suggests the presence of meaningful settlement patterns at both local and regional scales.

Along the Pacific Coast, the appearance of shell fishhooks has been interpreted as part of different contexts of growing population, economic specialization, and social complexity, among others. Along the coast of the Atacama Desert (18° to 26° Lat. South), fishhooks on Choromytilus chorus shells (mussel) appear in archaeological sites located along 1.6 thousand kilometers of coast with dates around 7500 years BP. Around 4500 BP. shell fishhooks disappeared from the Chilean archaeological record and were replaced by hooks made of cactus spines and animal bones. During the ~3000 years that hooks on mussel shells were present, archaeological deposits show evidence of increasing social complexity, specialized maritime economy and semi-sedentary settlement systems. Changes in hook´s shapes are also identified. Observed changes in fishing technology suggest deep changes within ancient fishing communities of South America, which were probably linked by long distance movements of people along thousands of kilometers. The present work will discuss the archaeological context of mussel shell fishhooks within the transitions experienced by Middle Holocene fishing communities of the Northern Coast of Chile.

Our conclusion contradicted the traditional “crab-shell” dichotomy proposed by Rainey and Rouse, but confirmed findings from elsewhere in the Caribbean. Presented here is a continuation of this work, with new faunal analyses incorporated from recently excavated inland, western, and earlier (Saladoid) sites, as well as faunal data from a few past reports that were recently discovered. Currently, the data indicate differences between assemblages from the previously examined coastal Troumassoid sites and the recently included inland occupations. A difference was also identified between all Troumassoid sites and the earlier Saladoid settlements. Comparison of the faunal assemblages not only helps to enhance our understanding of Grenada’s prehistoric environments, but also the communities that interacted with them. The differences between sites reveal local variations in subsistence strategies over time and further corroborate the transition to an expanded diet during the Troumassoid period.

The loss of coastal land to erosion presents a serious obstacle to our understanding of the archaeological coastscape, due to the unpredictable rate in which it exposes and damages archaeological features. The exposure and subsequent disappearance of material culture is seldom accompanied by systematic archaeological recording. As a result, a wide range of past activities associated with the coast remain unrecorded, their context poorly understood and our understanding of past human interaction at local, regional and inter-regional scales impaired. Coastal erosion is, thus, both a predicament of cultural heritage preservation and an epistemological problem.

The data suggest that seabirds represented a significant resource in the Faroese subsistence economy from the earliest Norse settlement onward. Fowling thus represented one component of a broad-based subsistence regime that was aimed primarily at decreasing vulnerability to food shortfalls, particularly those caused by failures in the agro-pastoral economy.

CIE compares the ecodynamics of long-term societal development in Iceland/Greenland.

To determine the effective limits of the elevation data to visualize low-relief structures, locations of previously-recorded Archaic and Woodland-period shell rings along the lower Atlantic coast were examined. Thirty-four rings were identified, including two previously undetectable at ground level without the use of shallow geophysics. To determine if undocumented rings could also be located using this method, the survey was then extended to an area along the South Carolina coast where shell rings were not previously documented, but which is situated a few kilometers from several known rings. In multiple LiDAR datasets, two faint ring-shaped anomalies were identified within the survey area. Fieldwork in May and July of 2017 confirmed that both anomalies represented low-relief Late Archaic shell rings. We conclude with preliminary data from the July fieldwork on the two rings, and contrast site maps produced using the LiDAR-derived data with those from ground-based topographical mapping, subsurface probing, and shovel testing.

By 1745, German potters began to fill local needs for ceramics, a trade which grew in importance over the next century and a half. These vessels took on more than just utilitarian roles, as choosing to purchase locally made ceramics over imported wares allowed Valley residents to perform various ethnic, regional, and racial identities. As a result, researchers portray these pots as inherently White things, made by Germans for Germans (and their Scots-Irish neighbors). This does not hold up, however, when we add Black Virginians into the picture. From free Black potters and enslaved peoples who labored for White potters to enslaved consumers who bought local vessels for themselves, Black Virginians in the Valley regularly interacted with these ceramics.

However, this did not end slavery itself in Africa. Intensification of cash-crop agriculture on the West African coast by the Danish colonists provoked an upsurge in the local slave trade.

The research examines the documentary and the archaeological data of one of the earliest Danish plantations (Frederikssted plantation) established in 1794 in Dodowa, in Ghana. 
Frederikssted and other Danish plantations are part of the building blocks of long-term cultural contact spanning almost two centuries (1658-1850) between Denmark and Ghana, and they offer this research the opportunity to gauge the   continuities and discontinuities in contemporary. The excavations and the resultant material culture reveal that Frederikssted plantation site represents different episodes of occupation, abandonment, and reoccupation.

University researchers (Sweden, UK, & Denmark) evaluated the project. This presentation describes qualitative results.
The objective was to investigate if/how experiences of participating in reminiscence sessions held in open-air museum venues affected wellbeing in PwD. 
Method: PwD (n 129) were interviewed individually or in groups. Third-person perspectives were gathered from carers accompanying PwD (n 75), and session facilitators (n 24) using questionnaires that included space for free-text responses. Interviews and free-text responses were analyzed with content analysis. 
Results: Both museum venue and object handling stimulated PwD reminiscence. 
Evidence strongly indicates that PwD wellbeing (denoted e.g., by showing pleasure, humour, creative self-expression, interest, sustained attention, and a sense of connection with others) was generally promoted through participation in museum-based reminiscence sessions.

Cultural appropriation or adoptation of orphan cultural identity?,South America: Andes,Other,Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology,Identity/Ethnicity,"In January 2017, members of the indigenous Salasaca community of the central sierra region of Ecuador discovered a cache of pre-Colombian pottery during ditch construction work which passed through a site of ritual significance. The government organisation responsible for managing antiquities removed the artefacts, promising that archaeological investigations would be carried out in due course. They never were.

The cache of artefacts was a strange mixture of authentic ceramic figurines and vessels of a wide geographical provenience, none of which were from the Salasaca area.  In the absence of formal excavations, it is unclear how they were deposited there in the first place. 

The local community responded enthusiastically, seeing the artefacts as an important connection with their lost ancestral past. Some believed they were mitmakuna – peoples translocated by Inca conquerors in the 15th century from an alternative geographic location to replace rebellious tribes recently conquered. They had some oral traditions, but no ancestral connection with the land they had been brought to, suggesting this cache of artefacts filled a lacuna in their sense of cultural identity.  

This paper discusses the importance of archaeology and material cultural in the construction of collective cultural identity and ancestral legitimacy.

",Other,Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology,Cultural Heritage and Preservation,"Official discourses of what is considered cultural heritage affect the preservation and management of archaeological sites, as well as how people perceive and understand their cultural heritage. Consequently, the manner in which sites are managed impacts the degree of participation that people can have in their preservation, an activity that may serve in shaping local identities. The archaeological site of Los Indios in Santa Isabel, Puerto Rico, is an undervalued archaeological resource whose resident community cares for its preservation. However, they feel that it is hardly possible due to the lack of the government’s interest, which has led many times to the destruction of sites. On the other hand, the regard of the historical site of Old San Juan as cultural heritage is rarely questioned given that residents have to follow rigorous rules imposed by the local and federal government for the preservation of the historical architecture. In this presentation, I explore the impact that cultural heritage discourses have had in the preservation of Puerto Rico’s archaeological resources, through the comparison and analysis of: cases of archaeological scandals in the Puerto Rican media, and cultural heritage discourses of government institutions, archaeologists and residents of Santa Isabel and Old San Juan.",40,Symposium,NA,40,Natalie,De La Torre Salas

Ancestral Puebloan fieldhouses (A.D. 1200-1600) were impacted at LANL, and rather than excavating additional fieldhouses for mitigation, a synthesis of fieldhouse data from the region was requested. The project resulted in the acquisition of new and meaningful research that advances northern New Mexico and helps LANL archaeologists determine eligibility recommendations.

However, this practice has contributed to the ‘othering’ of indigenous groups by placing the ‘mysterious Indians’ firmly in the past, and restricting the access of descendant communities. 

Working within a modern Maya community, the members of the Tihosuco Heritage Preservation and Development project seek to add to the national discourse on patrimony by using a tool recognized by the nation state: archaeology.

These ideals were entangled with the growing divide between professional and amateur sciences, and the establishment of modern land resource agencies, all of which fomented an antagonistic relationship among northern plains Tribes, dealers, amateur collectors, and Eastern professionals. The resulting heritage legislation provided professional archaeologists and federal land managers with near-exclusive (legal) authority over archaeology on public lands, a fact that has created long-standing frustrations among Tribal authorities and local amateurs, who believe their contributions were marginalized and de-legitimized. These tensions persist today in Montana and other Western states, and have contributed to the polarization of professional, public, and Tribal interests—an ongoing conflict that undermines national goals of heritage preservation within the rural American West, while confusing the public about the value and relevance of archaeological research.",42,Symposium,NA,42,Nancy,Mahoney

Kelly a Colonel in the USAF who was based for a time at RAF Mildenhall in the 1950s.

 The inventory in the British Museum register for the Kelly collection, shows there was some attempt to identify the points by the museum staff at the time, and after reading communications between Col Kelly and Gale Sieveking, who was Assistant Keeper of the Department and worked on the Palaeolithic collections at Franks House at the time. But the descriptions were quite vague and some of the points were misidentified, and the collection remained unseen and studied for 40 years after its original registration.

In particular, the analysis of bone that has undergone diagenesis can be frustrating because the process of humification may potentially introduce contaminant organic carbon.  Diagenesis occurs during burial and results from a combination of two distinct processes: (1) reactions involving indigenous organic carbon, (2) the complexation of collagen with soil humic substances. The radiocarbon measurement of altered bone, then, affects the age of the bone and reflects the presence of the exogenous humic carbon. Because the influence of contamination on radiocarbon measurements is dependent on the age of the sample, removal of humic carbon, particularly for older samples, is a necessity for accurate measurement. Pretreatment methods, such as XAD treatment and single-amino acid radiocarbon dating, have been applied to eliminate contaminant carbon and provide a purified sample for dating.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is assumed to be the only carbon source for photosynthesis.

Dating four historic reference fish obtained from the Mississippi River in 1939 in southeastern Minnesota yielded four distinctly different dates that do not overlap. Instead, they span 1223 to 307 BP, leading to the conclusion that dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and perhaps other ancient carbon contributes to a freshwater reservoir affect. Trophic level of the fish (and their diet) is implicated in this date range since they were caught in the same river, probably during the same fishing expedition. Adding additional reference fish, including northern pike, caught elsewhere in the state returned differential offsets implicating geology and DIC as sources of ancient carbon. Wild rice harvested in 2015 yielded similar age offsets to the highest trophic level fish, suggesting both high tropic level fish and wild rice take in carbon from both the freshwater reservoir and the atmosphere.

Radiocarbon sample size can be reduced toward the minimum of the 40-100 millionths of a gram of carbon that is actually needed for standard AMS dating. This allows the dating of remarkably small samples, and it results in the imperceptible removal of carbon from more traditionally-sized samples, such as a charred maize kernel (the botanist will never know a dating sample has been removed). A surface-active technique, plasma oxidation preferentially samples carbon molecules from object exteriors, allowing repeated stratigraphic sampling through accumulations such as soot on fragments of cave or rockshelter ceilings and the interpretation of sequential dates. Masking techniques can focus sampling on only portions of artifacts, and other innovative applications include the dating of organic pottery pigments, residues on artifacts, and organic binders in mineral pigments.

Conceptually, the framework is useful because it addresses in a statistically principled way two vexing sources of equifinality in archaeological data: (1) the radiocarbon calibration curve and (2) the fact that even if demographic rates such as age-specific mortality, fertility, and migration are stable an infinite set of demographic histories can yield the same predicted growth rate and stable age distribution. Fortunately, not all demographic histories are equally likely and some are even impossible.

The type of artificial skull deformation used by the pre-Columbian population that inhabited Cuba was the oblique-tabular frontal-occipital, representative of the Arawak–Taino communities. This practice disappeared in the early years of Spanish colonization. Here we present a three-dimensional reconstruction of five specimens from the University of Havana. For the first time, a three-dimensional reconstruction of these fossils has been created. In order to compute the 3D model, we used close range Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry technique. Taking into account the limitations of the sample size, this is a preliminary study to identify the main deformations over the skull surface and to analyze the implications of cranial deformations in the structure of the craniovascular vessels. Our results show that cranial vasculature is developmentally plastic and responds to deformation in a predictable pattern.

These concurrent influences on human d2H-collagen values were examined in 11 North American archaeological sites.  The d2H-collagen values were compared to bone hydroxyapatite oxygen isotopes (i.e. d18O-HAP) and bone collagen nitrogen isotopes (i.e. d15N-collagen), which are proxies for meteoric water influence and amount of consumed protein, respectively.  Pooled site data yield moderate correlation between d2H-collagen and d18O-HAP and moderate correlation between d2H-collagen and d15N-collagen.  Conversion of d2H-collagen and d18O-HAP to meteoric water values yielded a similarly moderate correlation with a d2H/d18O slope below 8, the expected value observed in meteoric water.  Conversion to theoretical hydrogen isotope values free of trophic level influences resulted in a weak correlation with d15N-collagen, suggesting that direct trophic level enrichment/depletion is not controlling the disparity between expected and measured values.

More recently, researchers are sampling tooth enamel, which is more likely to retain a biogenic record of lead exposure. Since teeth form during childhood and lead exposure reflects individuals’ interactions with their physical and cultural environments, this tissue presents an intriguing means to examine childhood health. However, archaeological research often overlooks children as meaningful cultural actors. The consideration of childhood social theory can help to illuminate methodological and theoretical opportunities to produce better lead trace element and isotope data that can be more clearly incorporated into understanding the Child’s World.

This paper describes analyses of burials uncovered during the 2017 field season utilizing the taphonomy-centered archaeothanatological approach to excavation and interpretation. Using this approach, specific consideration was given to a number of burials with destructive cranial lesions that may be evidence for the earliest known cases of treponemal disease in the North American Desert West.

It is a sequence that links well-dated Ronquin and cognate ceramic assemblages found within wide-spread paleosol horizons that are nothing more than allogenic stratums linked to broader climatic events both within and beyond the Orinoco Valley.",46,Symposium,NA,46,William,Barse

Large quantities of ceramic materials were recovered. This site was identified as belonging to the Middle Woodland North Bay culture as defined by Mason. Among the body sherds were those with smooth or cordmarked exterior surfaces. Smooth surfaced sherds exhibited breaks along coil lines, indicative of coil construction technique. Meanwhile, coil breaks were not recorded on  cordmarked sherds indicating a manufacturing technique based on fusing slabs of clay utilizing a cord wrapped paddle and anvil.  The Richter site data indicate that surface finish results from  variable manufacturing techniques, and may not be strictly decorative in nature. Furthermore, there is evidence of temporal differences in the two construction methods at Richter. Cord marked slab  vessels appear to be associated with Early Woodland period site occupation, while smoothed coiled vessels, which are very similar to those found at Laurel sites, are associated with Middle Woodland occupation at the site.

D’Hanis originated as an Alsatian colony on the Texas frontier, one of four settled by empresario Henry Castro in the 1840s. By the 20th century, the town had not simply transformed but moved – the railroad had caused a rupture in the settlement that resulted in an “old” and “new” D’Hanis, two competing towns with the same name approximately a mile apart. Today, few structures in Old D’Hanis remain, while New D’Hanis retains the aesthetic of a western railroad town. Archaeologically, this paper examines the spatial and material strategies that residents used to create two places out of one. Narratively, it examines how the town narrates a sense of place in the past and present. This paper aims to explore how we, as archaeologists, might approach the intersections of material and narrative strategies in our studies of place. Further, it suggests that linguistic anthropological methods and theories offer opportunities for historical archaeologists to better understand how people create and maintain places in space and through time.",47,Symposium,NA,47,Patricia,Markert

Figures appear in diverse media and sizes including stone, copper, shell, earthen effigy mounds, and petroglyphs/petrographs. In the literature, they are most frequently addressed as examples of art for the regions in which they are found, but rarely as pan-North American phenomena. A solely regional perspective implies that they only had local audiences. Human figures and disembodied parts are rarely examined, or compared/contrasted with reference to wider geographic regions as potentially having had diverse and travelling audiences. This regionalism has developed despite Omaha self-identification as having relocated several times, and the patchwork distribution of linguistic groups across North America for example, speakers of Siouan languages are found in both the Great Plains and South East. This research looks at full figures, hands, and hand and arm postures as one example of such widespread imagery.

",Historic,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis,Trade and Exchange,"Tortoiseshell is made from the scutes of sea turtles; historically, hawksbill turtle was the main source of tortoiseshell but other species might have been used. Between the 17th and 18th c. tortoiseshell obtained in the Caribbean was traded on North American and European markets. Tortoiseshell was used for making combs, fans, boxes, in bookbinding, and as veneering for furniture. Excavations in European workshops (Paris and Amsterdam) attest of the use of this exotic material into luxurious items. However, archaeological fragments of tortoiseshell or artefacts have degraded, so that often the material has lost its recognizable tortoiseshell pattern, making identification to species difficult. 
The carapace and plastron of sea turtles are covered with keratinous scutes mainly composed of beta-keratins, a category of structural proteins that stack together to produce ß-pleated sheet structures. Here, reference materials from five species of marine turtles were characterized by proteomics analysis to build a database of beta-keratin sequences and determine robust markers for species identification. Preliminary data have shown significant differences between hawksbill and green turtles, allowing distinction of these species in ancient materials. In addition, comb fragments from archaeological sites and workshops in France were examined.

This investigative study of black surface staining on mammalian sub-fossil bone excavated from the bed of the Santa Fe River in northern Florida exemplifies the need to carefully evaluate post-depositional alteration. Such stains typically are attributed to secondary mineralization of manganese oxides, however microanalysis revealed no evidence for manganese but instead identified crystals of pyrite within a thick red and black banded stain, identified as iron oxide and a ferric tannate complex respectively. Based upon multiple analytical methods, reaction mechanisms are proposed. This study debuts a novel sample preparation method for high-vacuum analysis of bone material, and demonstrates a cost-effective method to differentiate between damaging pyrite and other inert sulfur compounds in specimens. Results indicate that fossil coating types are extremely dependent upon the chemistry of the environment in which they are buried. Further, it is proposed that staining phenomena affecting fossils may pose risk to collections if not properly identified, treated, and curated.",48,Symposium,NA,48,Kimberly,Foecke

Archaeological contexts at the site indicate that the uses of Spondylus, either as non-worked valves, or finished artifacts was restricted to a small high-status sphere of Copan society. Additionally, contextual data indicate that the Spondylus was used in a least three ritual activities: as offering in burials; caches; and canceling of building. These uses of Spondylus shells appear to be constant from the Early Classic to the Late Classic period. The lack of information from the Postclassic period, hinders conclusions regarding the commerce of Spondylus shells during this time. The two species of Spondylus analyzed in this work are found in the Pacific Coast, from California down to Ecuador.

Theoretical morphology proceeds by creating and examining hypothetical specimens not actually found in nature. So instead of asking “why does feature X exist”, a theoretical morphological approach asks “why doesn’t feature Y exist?”. Here, we use this approach to address the question of why ceramic technology did not evolve to replace stone technology with respect to hunting weapon tips (spear points, atlatl dart tips, arrowheads). In other words: why didn’t the ceramic projectile point emerge? Clay is a readily available, economically efficient, and easily workable raw material. Likewise, objects made out of fired clay are extremely hard, sharp, and generally durable. We hypothesized that there was perhaps a functional constraint such that ceramic hunting weapon tips cannot perform as effectively as stone ones. We conducted an archaeological experiment using stone and ceramic replicas, and assessed point penetrability and durability. The results of this study will have implications for our understanding of prehistoric weaponry evolution.

Examination by high-resolution microanalysis (SEM-EDS, TEM, FTIR, micro-Raman) has revealed evidence pertaining to source selection of the iron-oxides used to produce the pictographs, the weathering and condition of the panels, and potential evidence for pigment enhancement by pyrotechnology. The pictographs at Boling Point were painted on an outcrop of argillaceous limestone covered in a kaolinitic weathering deposit. This natural canvas, and subsequent accretionary deposition, has aided in the long-term preservation of the panel. The pigment is composed of a homogenized mixture of ferrihydrite and hematite that was biogenically produced ex situ, most likely in a spring deposit, by aquatic iron-oxide producing bacteria, including Leptothrix ochracea and Gallionella spp. Preliminary results of high-sensitivity magnetometry also suggest that the pigment was thermally altered to induce iron oxide phase change to enhance colour properties.

",Paleolithic,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis,Material Culture and Technology,"The heat treatment of stone to enhance flaking attributes was an important advancement in the adaptive toolkit of early humans.  The earliest evidence for this is the heat treatment of silcrete 164 ka at the Middle Stone Age site Pinnacle Point 13B in South Africa.  Heating stone prior to knapping alters the physical and chemical composition of the stone, and it has long been recognized that flaked heat-treated stone has a glossier surface.  We expect this glossiness to result from a smoother flaked surface.  Thus, we investigated whether surface roughness, as measured by a 3D microscope, can be used as a proxy to identify the presence of heat treatment in the archaeological record.  The results of our unpublished pilot study suggested roughness parameters differ significantly between untreated and treated silcrete.  In the present study, we record values for multiple surface texture parameters on a sample of experimentally created stone tools from paired heat-treated and untreated silcrete nodules.  A Bayesian probability model, trained on the experimental sample, was then used to evaluate the probability individual artifacts have undergone heat treatment.

Here, we propose a new methodology for studying bone surface traces that will reduce the problems of unreliable and unreplicable results in more traditional qualitative analyses. We seek to understand the basics of use-wear formation over time by incrementally taking impressions of bone specimens subjected to a controlled, mechanical experiment. Our study assesses how bone wears during extended use on three materials (leather, fresh hide, or bark), starting from three modification states (unmodified, modified by flint or by sandstone). 3D surface texture analysis is used to quantitatively measure various features of bone surfaces, such as surface roughness [Sa], peak curvature [Spc], autocorrelation length [Sal], and lower material ratio [Smr2].

One component of the problem is rooted in copper’s innately malleable nature. Copper was made into a wide range of tools and non-utilitarian items during prehistory.  While most of these types have been enumerated, there are no published resources suggesting the morphological range or variation of copper artifacts one might expect in any given region. This paper will report the morphological range and degree of variation measured on a collection of over 1000 copper artifacts from two localities in central Wisconsin. This data is then used to characterize copper usage in these two localities and provides comparative context for artifacts recovered in small numbers or through unconventional means.

And two, that the energy expenditure required for raw material acquisition and production of copper tools was much greater than that for other material types.

",Paleolithic,Use-Wear Analysis,Material Culture and Technology,"The paper investigates some fundamental aspects of use-wear of lithic artifacts, concerning the relations between function and morphology. During the course of micro-wear research history since 1960s, it was often questioned whether tool typology actually reflects their functions, or which morphological attributes are diagnostic of their utilization. Case studies in the Upper Paleolithic of East Asia also revealed variabilities from end-scrapers whose functions seem to be relatively consistent as hide working tools, to burins which exhibit diversified usage, as well as projectile points whose functions are less evident from traceological data. A more theoretical approach to use-wear is proposed here for understanding complex diversity of tool function. The concept of “technological organization” (by Binford) combined with settlement patterns along a river basin, is applied to traceological research in the Paleolithic of northeastern part of the Japanese archipelago.

In such a social framework, it becomes important to guard the transmission of esoteric knowledge, restricting access by exclusive mechanisms of indoctrination or co-option. When discovered, evidence of guarded knowledge often flags the attention of the archaeologist because of its often meticulous preservation. However, if the same knowledge were conspicuous, unguarded, and socially mundane, evidence of it is less likely to preserve as well archaeologically, and archaeologists might be more inclined to underestimate its cognitive sophistication. Ancient rock art paintings conspicuously placed on the ceiling of a cave along the lower Amazon River conveys sophisticated astronomy knowledge that parallels knowledge chronicled during contact and historical periods from oral transmission. Archaeological excavations of the cave and region reveal low-density populations since the earliest period of human habitation over 13,000 years ago, during the same period that most of the red ochre pictographs were painted. Here, I argue that this small-scale society transmitted sophisticated knowledge through conspicuous rock art, which later transferred, or was re-imagined, through oral transmission.

In various geographic locations and time periods, human beings have been frequenting dark zones for ritual purposes. Regarding the unsuitable living conditions of dark zones, the following question arises: what drives humans to choose such places for practicing rituals? The answer to this question lies in the way human beings interact with dark cave environments. In this paper, I suggest that experiencing sensory deprivation, in particular lack of vision in dark zones, precipitates the enhancement of abstract and magical thinking. To verify this hypothesis, I employed the methods of cognitive scientists—namely, experimental research. I conducted an experiment using eye-tracking glasses to record participants’ eye-movement trajectories in darkness. The results indicated that eye-movement patterns during darkness resemble that of activities involving abstract and primary process thinking (aka magical thinking). Consequently, darkness provokes and facilitates magical thinking. Thus, I suggest that in addition to social and cultural incentives, darkness, as an environmental cue, sets the stage for human beings to associate dark zones of caves with supernatural powers and therefore choose to practice rituals in such locations.

In the mid-13th century, the Tsegi Canyon region of northeastern Arizona followed a greater regional trend of communities coalescing into defensive high canyon alcoves, accompanied by the adoption of shield iconography, likely influenced by Freemont traditions to the north. These images are variously interpreted to represent clan symbols, warning signs to enemies, or magically imbued protective icons. In the Tsegi area, this motif followed a strict spatial pattern of placing large, usually white, shield imagery on the right side of cliff dwellings. By comparing the spatial placement of shield imagery on Pueblo III sites throughout the Northern Southwest, it is evident that the communities of the Tsegi Canyon system may be differentiated through their commitment to the placement of these iconic, highly visible pictographs on the right side of cliff dwellings. Rather than the imagery adorning the shields, group affiliation among Tsegi populations is best demonstrated by this formalized placement of the motif on defensive sites.",50,Symposium,NA,50,Maxwell,Forton

Results indicate that specific watercraft and their associated paraphernalia represent the earliest temple as the mound of creation, 3250 BCE, a window into the politico-religious foundations of the Egyptian State.

By combining the surprisingly vast collection of Greek and Latin references to ancient beers, the archaeobotanical remains from individual settlements and cultures, broader archaeological and artistic evidence, and complementary food and wine preparations, I have produced several complete beers, individual components of beer (e.g. malts), adjunct-beer combinations, and brewing techniques. With this experimental archaeology, I demonstrate the diversity of research questions that can be addressed, especially those related to the dissemination of technological knowledge, ancient diet, agriculture, and feasting.

Relatively little is known about WBT human-plant interaction as compared to their maize-bean-squash cultivating Iroquoian neighbors. Culture-historical models of the WBT are proving to be outdated, overemphasizing the supposed difference between WBT ‘hunter-gatherer’ subsistence strategies and Iroquoian farming. Recent isotopic analyses have suggested archaeologists have been underestimating the amount of maize consumed among the WBT peoples at this time, and limited excavation and botanical analysis has hindered the revision of our understanding of their subsistence practices. Plant remains from the Arkona Cluster sites, however, show WBT peoples were indeed cultivating maize, calling into question our conceptualization of their food production, landscape construction, and mobility. Paleoethnobotanical methods were employed to elucidate plant-human interaction of these culturally-distinct peoples residing at the periphery of Iroquoian territory and influence.

The Neo-Assyrian empire is known as one of the major empires in the Ancient Near East. Ruling in Mesopotamia during the Iron Age, they had a well-organized agricultural system. In this paper, I will utilize phytolith analyses to investigate the impact of the Neo-Assyrian empire on agriculture and land-use. I will compare the elite-controlled agriculture with the crop choices of peasant farmers. It’s likely that the peasant farmers would have choosen more resistant and reliable types of plants for their own food which would reduce the risks of unexpected natural disasters such as droughts and floods. In order to conduct this research, I use phytolith data from Iraqi Kurdistan, at on-going excavations of Assyrian-period sites in the Peshdar Plain, including two main sites: Gird-l Bazar and Qalat-l Dinka, directed by Professor Karen Radner, University of Munich. These two sites are very promising for this research. Gird-l Bazar is a non-elite farming and production village, and Qalat-l Dinka is an administrative center being sustained by Gird-l Bazar. Thus, the two will cover the empire’s impact on agriculture and the farmers’ choices in cultivation and production.

In studying this collection, there are a variety of factors that preclude traditional paleoethnobotanical methods. First, the protocol for handling carbonized botanicals from waterlogged sites is to maintain their moisture content, which is an impossibility in this context. In addition, since these excavations were carried out in the 1800s, artifacts were removed from the site without regard for stratigraphy and excavations were funded through the sale of Lake Dwelling objects, making quantification of these assemblages impossible. This paper examines the Milwaukee Public Museum’s collection of botanical and food remains, given the limitations inherent in the study of waterlogged carbonized material excavated before modern paleoethnobotanical methods were developed.

Previous univariate mortuary analyses at Chiribaya Alta have identified gendered grave goods, related to roles during life.

Here, we use a multivariate technique, multiple correspondence analysis, to analyze the graves at Chiribaya Alta. Sex is not included in this analysis and thus, the MCA groups graves without assuming a binary construction of sex. Instead, sex information is only used in the interpretation phase of the analysis. Our MCA confirms that Chiribaya graves are differentiated by gender based on funerary objects but shows greater variation in the graves of females in comparison to males, suggesting that women’s gendered activities were more variable than those of men. Furthermore, the overlap in the graves of males and females suggests that these gender categories are not binary opposites, and thus we suggest an alternative system for conceptualizing gender identity in the Chiribaya polity.

Data from salvage excavations of a Terminal Classic disturbed ossuary in the archaeological zone of Yaxuná in central Yucatan are compared with ossuary deposits at Chichén Itzá, 20km to the north. Along with population decline at Yaxuná during Chichén’s rise to power came a number of new cultural practices associated with the larger mega-site.  New funerary practices including an ossuary with numerous fragmented human remains as well as urn burials signal profound cultural changes during this time. This research illuminates how ossuaries are integral to the history of this region by providing spaces for collective memory and enhancing the relationship between space, the body, and community within Maya society.

The Muisca in particular have been held captive by the recordings of historical authors, and social structures observed through a European gaze have colored our interpretations of Muisca culture. New data from archaeological studies of Muisca sites are forcing a reevaluation of chiefdom models. This bioarchaeological study of diet and physical activity, based on 199 human burials from the site of Tibanica (Soacha, Colombia 1000-1400AD), will serve as a case study that focuses on the daily relationships that marked people along divisions between the sexes. Stable isotope analysis of tooth and bone samples indicate consumption of particular foods were tied to one’s age and sex. Cross-sectional geometry measures of long bones demonstrate a patterned, gendered division of labor. These divisions in diet and labor indicate that for the Muisca, gender was a very important social variable that united and separated groups in daily spheres of activity.",52,Symposium,NA,52,Melanie,Miller

This paper shifts that discussion from the arena of public commemoration and cultural rites to the de facto performances of the domestic sphere.  Private, interpersonal interactions are important in the transmission and creation of social memory as well- they place an individual’s social world in the context of shared social memory, and vice versa.  Gossip is cited with frequency in ethnographic accounts and anthropological analysis as containing a wealth of sociocultural meanings; is it possible in archaeology to gain perspectives from such “immaterial” interactions?  
This study identifies and interrogates the physical environments in which gossip would have occurred, entertainment and congregation spaces in domestic contexts, by modeling Roman domestic space as a performative space in which interpersonal influence was crucial.   In the Roman Empire, gossip was a notoriously influential sociopolitical practice that was enacted and documented in many public forums with great performative flair, and thus provides an excellent case for comparison of the material conditions of this practice with written accounts.

Direct study of agricultural fields in Eastern North America, however, has largely not been undertaken due to an absence of archaeological signatures marking the location of what were often ephemeral, extensive, and complex elements on the landscape. In the Upper Delaware River Valley, the historic Munsee and their ancestors lived on flood plain terraces where they practiced maize based agriculture.

While studying different forms of rural archaeology and landscapes, I have seen that rural forms of archaeology have often been sidelined for investigations into more “significant” urban remains. However, the archaeological record itself tends to indicate that a populace in a small farming, mining, timbering, or other rural-industrial economy is often not so very isolated, and vice-versa. Historical archaeology shows that dynamic interactions between the two “sides” mean that it is incorrect to assert strongly-drawn, almost “battle” lines between sections of society based upon where they live and work.

Such claims affirm rulers’ abilities to impose order on chaos and to control the natural, or seemingly natural, world by destroying it.

While the external façade of a palace represents the defining barrier between the elite and the public, the architectural layouts of ancient palaces reveal multiple levels of exclusivity. The varying levels of privacy in different palaces may relate to the differing roles and functions that palaces fulfilled across the ancient world. In some contexts palaces were simply a grandiose residence for the ruling elite, whereas elsewhere they fulfilled political, religious, administrative, economic and military functions. Furthermore, the accessibility of the inner areas of palaces might reflect the gulf between rulers and subjects, or the overall safety of the elite.

This research represents a study of the design and utilization of space in mortuary landscapes of the Nubian pharaohs. This project focuses on spatial analyses of the sites of El-Kurru, Nuri, and Gebel Barkal. The Kushite kings deliberately appropriated the Egyptian architectural symbol of the pyramid and other styles in the construction of royal mortuary landscapes. However, the formation and maintenance of royal identity manifested differently in the design and utilization of built landscapes, across the various periods.",54,Symposium,NA,54,Katherine,Rose

These discussions are often dominated by factors of population dynamics and production capacity. This paper will explore the less discussed factor of risk management. Controlling the variation of production in regard to fluctuating natural and social pressures was critical to past agrarian societies and undoubtedly played a role in the development of their intensive agricultural strategies. This is addressed by examining the geo-intensive agricultural strategy of the ancient Maya located in the hilly region of the North Vaca Plateau, Belize. The GIS modeling of a combined assemblage of datasets that include archaeological fieldwork, remote sensing (LiDAR), pedological analysis, and climatic reconstructions reveals the functional qualities of the agricultural terracing that forms the basis of the production strategy in this region. Results present the properties of terracing in relation to hydrological flow and erosion as well as their ability to increase land suitability for production by decreasing variation in the face of climatic fluctuations. Identifying the functional qualities of this intensive agricultural strategy will demonstrate an intentional action to ameliorate the risks experienced in the North Vaca Plateau.",54,Symposium,NA,54,Scott,Macrae

",Bronze Age,Digital Archaeology: GIS,Political Economy,"There is a recursive relationship between socio-economic institutions and the environment. Decisions about where to place settlements in a landscape were informed by existing economic institutions, but placement of sites in turn effected how social and economic institutions were organized. In this paper, I present a new GIS-based method for quantifying socio-economic organization and change in prehistoric societies. Catchment analyses, as employed in this study, define the availability of economic resources for individual settlements. This approach then quantifies cultural preferences across settlement systems. As a case study, I monitor settlement systems throughout the Early and Middle Bronze Age in southwest Transylvania. Southwest Transylvania is a major metal producing region that underwent significant socio-economic changes as metal became commodified throughout the European Bronze Age. Using catchment analysis, I demonstrate that communities in metal-rich landscapes increasingly prioritized access to agricultural land and access to interregional trade routes over metal ore sources. This result challenges existing narratives for how increasingly complex societies emerged in late prehistoric Europe. The method presented in this paper is easily transferable to other regional contexts and can be an additional tool for archaeologists exploring socio-economic organization and change in the past.",54,Symposium,NA,54,Colin,Quinn

Typically, the elite are cast as the drivers of these shifts, yet it was rural labor that produced the goods (particularly foodstuffs) traded in the cities, collected in the form of rent and taxes, and transformed into capital. This paper examines the impact of rural landscape strategies during the development of the medieval city-state of Lucca.  Historically Lucchese rural producers had greater autonomy compared to their counterparts elsewhere in medieval Europe when it came to land choices and production.  Using environmental models constructed in GIS, I examine rural settlement location in relation to land suitability for three major cultivars consumed in urban Lucca: vines, olives, and wheat. From 900 to 1300 AD, the period of city-state formation, I explore if and how rural settlement shifted to areas better or less suited to these crops, analyzing if rural producers changed their landscape occupation to engage with urban markets.

As the rural economy of New England shifted to a more urban and industrial one, much of this agricultural land was abandoned and subsequently reforested. The vestiges of this once rural landscape can now best be seen in LiDAR imagery, in which features such as stonewalls are particularly well discernible. Though the spatial and temporal dimensions of reforestation vary across the region, this paper investigates the extent to which the forest vegetation present today reflects the legacy of land-use evidenced by historical documents and LiDAR imagery. Using these data to precisely identify areas of prior deforestation and intensive land-use, the forest vegetation now present is analyzed through historic CORONA and modern high resolution multispectral satellite imagery to track the progress of reforestation as well as investigate spectral properties that are unique to such areas. In doing so, the legacy of deforestation and abandonment in New England can be better understood, and new tools provided for the study of this landscape in areas where stonewalls are not as frequent or well preserved.

However, new technical developments are bringing another dimension to these old sources of information. Many historic aerial photos were taken in a series of densely overlapping photos to minimize the effects of lens distortion for use in surveillance, cartography, or other purposes where accuracy in measurement was important. While useful, the resulting photos also create stereoscopic sets that are ideal for analysis using photogrammetric methods. These techniques allow researchers to generate three-dimensional reconstructions of the landscape as it existed when the photos were taken. The resulting models can then be compared to models generated from modern imagery to examine landscape dynamics on a regional or local scale at extraordinarily high resolutions. Very small changes to the landscape, and to individual archaeological sites can be mapped, measured and analyzed. In some cases, it is even possible to explore sites that have ceased to exist today.

",Iron Age,Remote Sensing/Geophysics,Quantitative and Spatial Analysis,"Satellite imagery and remote sensing have secured a place in the archaeological toolbox, but the scale of satellite derived data often results in large datasets with individual image tiles consisting of many gigabytes. Consequently, performing complex analyses on satellite data can be computationally intensive to a prohibitive degree. Google Earth Engine (GEE), an in-development, cloud-based platform for visualizing/analyzing satellite imagery, affords a solution for researchers with limited access to computational processing power (Gorelick et al. 2017). GEE is freely accessible through a web browser, but analysis is completed on Google’s cyber-infrastructure, facilitating rapid analyses on any scale (including planetary). Moreover, through the GEE platform, users can create custom scripts to suit their specific research questions and needs. This paper explores potential contributions of GEE to archaeological research through two case studies. First, GEE was used to automatically identify specific archaeological features across the Faynan region of Southern Jordan. Second, GEE-based edge-detection and automatic vectorization was tested for mapping archaeological sites at the Iron Age (ca. 1200–900 BCE) site of Khirbat al-Jariya in Faynan. Through these trials, GEE proved a viable tool for archaeological research with significant potential to supplement traditional forms of archaeological survey and mapping.

While research pursued in the dTFA framework has gained momentum over the intervening decades, questions regarding its reliability if not legitimacy have also emerged. Arguably, this critical pushback is the result of the tacit but persistent reluctance both of advocates and critics to give full formal expression to dTFA’s core theory. In turn, this reluctance has led to the inadvertent conflation of the program’s foundational principles and its special-case conditions, as well as to vague impressions regarding the degree to which non-demographic forces obscure demographic information in tfds. In response, I explicitly formalize Rick’s framework as a functional decomposition of the tfd DGP.

Such behaviors are adaptive, according to Dunnell, because groups that undertake them will have lower birth rates than groups that do not and therefore will be less likely to experience food shortages in bad years. In addition, wasteful behaviors are adaptive because they represent a reservoir of time and energy that can be devoted to subsistence and/or reproduction in times of difficulty. Here, we report the results of a study in which we tested the waste hypothesis with an agent-based model in which the severity and predictability of environmental threats and the agents’ propensity to waste time and energy were varied systematically.

With the use of a 3D scanner hardware and 3D program software, objects and features of various sizes are scanned to create a proportional and scale digital version. The scanning of artifacts allows for minimal handling of the objects decreasing the likelihood of wear, damage, deterioration, and contamination, effectively lending to conservation. This technology facilitates a full range of examination capabilities in a manipulable high resolution digital format that is easily transferrable and portable. In addition, digital formats enhance teaching pedagogy and public outreach. The potential of 3D scanning promotes a new kind of research that provides a practical interactive interface to websites, e-books, and research papers that contributes an entirely new dimension to responsive learning. Furthermore, in conjunction with 3D printing, the data can be physically reproduced inexpensively and fairly quickly to provide a tangible object that can be used for a variety of research, educational, and demonstrative purposes.",56,Symposium,NA,56,Luke,Burnor

A maritime landscape approach draws on the “lure of the sea” that attracts many people to shipwreck studies, but engages larger constituencies through place-based history. Geographic space is one of the things that all people share and maritime landscapes loom large for many cultures due to the power, beauty, bounty, danger, and opportunity that water bodies hold. Maritime landscapes also allow for alternative histories to exist in the same space because landscapes are interpreted through a cultural lens. Groups that may be disenfranchised by the colonial histories often associated with shipwrecks can connect with maritime archaeology through the physical remains of their ancestors’ maritime occupations and beliefs.

At that time, sea levels had fallen approximately 100 m and people utilized a pond in the bottom of a sinkhole that was located ca. 250 km inland from the coast.  Subsequent sea level rise slowly submerged the site, 4 m of sediment buried the site, and the sinkhole became part of the Aucilla River channel.  This scenario was repeated at multiple sites, creating a rich underwater record of archaeological sites dating to the Late Pleistocene in Northwest Florida.

Sea level reconstruction indicates that the oldest site component was formed just above the tidal range at the time of occupation, was subsequently submerged, and is now situated over 6 meters below surface and overlain by estuarine mud. In response to progressively rising sea levels, later temporal components of this shell mound were formed at increasingly higher elevations. Paleoenvironmental analysis of diatoms and pollen reveal that during the Middle Holocene this estuary was largely freshwater, and transitioned to brackish conditions beginning around 5000 years ago.

Here, using an argument drawn from New Guinea ethnography, we hypothesize that some Maine middens were not simply rubbish heaps, but conspicuous constructions that, among other things, maintained peace among neighboring aboriginal polities. 
Behavioral ecologists theorize that, as honest signals of fighting strength, threat displays and ritualized fighting are information-gathering devices that allow both parties to a conflict to establish the victor without either having to risk the potentially catastrophic costs of serious fighting (Enquist and Leimar 1990). Analogously, we propose, some Maine shell middens were indexical signals of a polity’s fighting strength that helped maintain peace by mediating inter-polity conflict. As signals of consumption, scale of feasting, and available food resources, the middens broadcast the number of members and allies a polity could muster, as well as their commitment to its projects. The hypothesis gains support from the distribution of both middens and their contents.

We explore some of the reasons behind this change, including possible shifts in human settlement patterns based on isotopic analysis of shellfish.

The buffering effect of the decomposition of carbonate shells yields preservation of organic artifacts that are often not preserved in other settings. Additionally, climate-change driven sea-level rise threatens many of these valuable cultural and paleoenvironmental archives.

These become known through academic degrees, peer reviewed publications, project reports, conference presentations and interactions with peers, colleagues, the public and even the media. Formal training is listed in detail in personal vitae and may be measured and judged by the outputs but how we do archaeology as individuals is also the result of our personal experiences, not least of which are the projects we work on and the people with whom we work and interact.  Legends of the Dinsmore Hilton chronicle these experiences. To date, these are primarily in the form of oral tradition as many of the participants are still extant and written versions might be subject to civil suits.

At the urging of John M. (“Jack”) Campbell he began work near Point Barrow in 1968 to investigate controversial questions about the origins of Thule culture.  Following brief investigations at the Utkiavik site, he focused his excavations south of Barrow at Walakpa, where he discovered more than 20 stratigraphic levels documenting the transition from Birnirk to Thule cultures.  His analysis led him to conclude that the transition from Birnirk to Thule was correlated to climate change and possibly an over-reliance on seal hunting.  His subsequent research interest in Alaska have focused the relationships between eastern Beringia and the first colonization of the Americas.  In 1989-90 he served as Visiting Distinguished Professor, at the Alaskan Quaternary Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks where he taught Paleoindian archeology and mentored students.

Yet, this somewhat simplifies the story. Throughout the Andean region, but especially away from the early strongholds of Spanish power, such as the towns and cities, conquest was a mixture of appropriation and negotiation. Drawing on research from the Ica Highlands (South-central Peru) and the Cordillera Negra (North-central Peru) this paper examines how Spanish religious orders initially occupied sacred indigenous sites, linking them directly to local cosmological landscapes. With time, the contradiction between an externalized (Andean – animated landscape) and an internalized (Christian – church) system of worship amid growing Spanish hegemony called for a renegotiation of this earlier modos operandi. In turn, this lead to the abandonment of early church sites, in favor of churches in new town reducciones – imperial settlements which concentrated a declining indigenous population in more accessible areas – that led to a disconnect with the earlier Andean landscape. Nevertheless, the resulting Andean church was always syncretic, for instance, combining Christian saints with Andean deities, and local pilgrimage routes that directly evoked earlier indigenous sacred sites.

Our focus is not simply on indigenous groups or colonists, but rather on the larger context of agents within multi-cultural, pluralistic colonies. The colonies established by the Spanish throughout the Americas, the Caribbean, Pacific, Southeast Asia and Africa, brought together individuals and groups from both near and distant diverse cultures. Together, these colonies were economically, politically, and religiously connected to one another.  Spanish colonies were, moreover, a catalysis of cross-cultural exchange, conflict, and persistence as colonists, merchants, and various indigenous individuals and groups moved throughout the empire.

Its shores were inhabited by mestizos, mulattos, slaves, and free slaves, with a minority of Indians and Spaniards. While this area was mined for gold and offered one of few routes to the Pacific from Colombia’s interior, the Dagua River region was largely cut off from global trade and colonial currents due to its geographical remoteness. 50 days distant from Cartagena and 14 from the nearest town, Cali, it was just beyond the reach of Spanish colonial authorities. 

For the Dagua’s largely self-governing and self-sustaining inhabitants, including African slaves, topographical challenges such as steep cordilleras, dense tropical jungles, and torrential rivers gave rise to social, cultural, and economic opportunities. Spaniards, who theoretically were in control as hacendados, merchants, and miners, depended on forasteros—French doctors, Italian notaries, and African slaves. African slaves in the Dagua region came to wield great power and autonomy, controlling terrestrial and river commerce, effectively fighting royal aguardiente and tobacco monopolies, buying their freedom, and building free slave communities. Their descendants would inhabit this area into the early twentieth century. Methods are art historical, historical, cartographic, and ethnographic.

Previously thought to be at least 2,000 years old, investigations in the region have now established that wet-rice cultivation was a response of highland populations to the Spanish conquest at ca. 1650 CE.  The shift to an intensive cultivation drastically changed Ifugao social organization that allowed them to successfully resist multiple attempts of the Spanish to place them under the colonial administration.   Contemporary Ifugao identity is based on the narrative of being uncolonized as well as centered on wet-rice cultivation.  Even when the market economy exerts pressure on the agricultural system, Ifugao families endeavor to continue producing wet-rice and sponsor rice-planting rituals.  The persistence of wet-rice farming and rice rituals are interpreted as an active resistance of the Ifugao against assimilation to the larger Philippine society and conscious acts of maintaining their identity.  Utilizing archaeological, ethnographic, spatial, productivity, and energetics data associated with wet-rice cultivation, this presentation aims to illustrate the continuity of Ifugao struggle against hegemonic cultures.

Despite centuries of debate, supposition, and guesswork based on scanty historical records, archaeological evidence has yet to be brought to bear on these events.  This paper examines what the discipline of archaeology might bring to the study of first contacts throughout the Spanish Empire, comparing the events that occurred at Zuni in 1539 with first contact narratives from the Caribbean and Southeastern North America.

Historians regard this as the first capital of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala. After its location at Iximche, Santiago had two sequential locations near Olintepeque and in Chimaltenango. The ruins of the first permanent Santiago de Guatemala, founded in 1527 in the Valley of Almolonga and destroyed in 1541, lie beneath the modern village of San Miguel Escobar. An indigenous town of several hundred resettled Mexican auxiliaries and their families located in the village of Almolonga or “Ciudad Vieja,” grew up about two kilometers to the west. The acta de fundación of Santiago implies a grid-plan layout, but we know almost nothing of the spatial organization of these centers since they lack detailed archaeological investigation. We know them primarily through extensive historical research. In contrast, San Salvador, founded by an expedition from Santiago in 1528, also known archaeologically as “Ciudad Vieja,” has been the subject of detailed archaeological investigation as well as historical research. Contextual comparisons between these two closely related early Spanish colonial urban centers has proven very useful.

Pacific) with the intention of establishing colonies. The motivations for these voyages were an uneasy amalgam of ambitions for Imperial and familial advancement, attempts to find the gold mines of Ophir, and religious fervor for converting indigenous populations. Despite repeated historical retelling, little attention has been paid to the structures of the cross-cultural encounters described in the original narratives. Ethno-historical analysis reveals an extraordinary diversity of responses in these interactions, from prosaic trading, through to wilful acts of physical and sexual aggression, and highly charged spiritual contests. While the Spanish presence was largely ephemeral, with even the nascent colonies lasting only several weeks, the sometimes dramatic shifts in status from transitory explorer, to colonist, to survivor often resulted in similarly significant transformations in relations with indigenous groups. Beyond the documentary record, the archaeological record also shows evidence of longer-term repercussions and attempts by indigenous groups to mitigate these transitory exchanges. In particular this paper will follow in the tradition of Australian Pacific ethno-historians such as Dening and Clendinnen in exploring the nature of performance within these cross cultural encounters.",2929,Electronic Symposium,Presenter,2929,Martin,Gibbs

As such, when the Spanish colonial regime took hold in the Sierra Sur, people in Nejapa and Tavela were already accustomed to making strategic choices about how to engage.  Some distanced themselves from migrants, merchants, and militaries, while others embraced new opportunities for trade and exchange.  Some used the Spanish legal system to protect or solidify their social and political standing, while others persisted in maintaining subversive and secret indigenous religious practices and spaces.

Portugal and Spain share centuries of culture history, religion, and governance, and were united under the Iberian Union between 1580 and 1640. Yet within the context of European expansion into the non-Western world, they have often been considered distinct with regard to their histories and as foci of study. Pushing beyond national pasts, this paper contextualizes Portuguese and Spanish intersections with varied African people and polities in terms of both the wider socioeconomic landscapes of which they were part and the local conditions and contingencies that mitigated policy, and structured locally articulated social, cultural, and economic interactions. While inescapably nested in European nationalist agendas and global economy, the cultural exchanges of Portugal and Spain in Africa were characterized more by variability than by unitary templates, more by persistence than hegemonic change.

Moving beyond dichotomies of colonizer/colonized, dominance/resistance, or aggressors/passive recipients of change, we offer a more nuanced, comparative exploration. Encounters between agents of the Spanish State and native communities quickly created a web of pluralistic, global cross-cultural interactions. Spanish colonies in each region were hotbeds of cross-cultural exchange and conflict, including the creation and recreation of identities, as well as the persistence of local and indigenous traditions in old and new places and contexts. Within these multi-cultural contexts, archaeological approaches to ethnogenesis pay close attention to patterned material practices that signify identity formation, manipulation and reinforcement.

Small villages faced the possibility of effective, long-range attacks that could potentially lead to the quick application of overwhelming force on unprepared villages. To address this potential, settlements moved to less productive upland locations with inter-visible settlement clusters that provided for mutual defense through defense in layers. As agriculture became better established, this pattern of defense again changed as people nucleated into larger sites in highly productive, lowland areas. Defense was still a significant consideration as reflected in both the selection of defensible topographic settings and the apparent creation of a borderland along the river. The larger number of people in each village provided safety in numbers and decreased the likelihood of overwhelming attacks. The influence of archery and the selection for effective defensive strategies in the face of archery-based warfare could help explain the rapid shift to inter-visible, upland sites during the Late Woodland Period and the subsequent rise of large nucleated settlements.",2930,Symposium,Presenter,2930,Kerry,Nichols

A salient research topic within broader investigations of conflict is how populations cope with chronic warfare. This presentation utilizes geostatistical analyses of architectural and topographical features to reconstruct defensive coping mechanisms among LIP groups living in 12 fortified settlements in the southern Nasca highlands of Peru. Analytical results reveal a regional defensive pattern whereby the smallest most vulnerable groups invested the most in fortifications and occupied the least accessible hilltops. Variation in fortification investment within each site was driven by differences in the accessibility of approaches leading to a site’s residential sector. This research demonstrates that LIP populations made optimal trade-offs between competing defensive variables, revealing highly patterned regional defensive strategies that vary from defensive practices observed in other LIP regions. This variation is likely the result of groups implementing defensive strategies to cope with local patterns of warfare.

Analysis of natural environments (e.g., local wind, precipitation, water tables) and strategic features of locations allows a different interpretation. With the equal chance, the Sintashta ‘fortified’ settlements can be artificial ecological niches that allowed pastoralists to keep and maintain livestock in the harsh winter conditions.

Widespread fortification not only marked a new defensive landscape, but also reflected and reinforced broader social and political transformations—including increasing settlement nucleation and the coalescence of new ethnic identities.

These two factors contributed to the low-density nature of Maya cities, and conditioned urban form and the structure of neighborhoods and districts.

However, a variety of interactions between top-down and bottom-up processes create neighborhoods, especially when they occur in areas of frequent, repeated face-to-face interaction between residents. The use of neighborhoods and districts as scales of analysis permits analysis of various concepts, including: urban infrastructural power, collective action among urban residents, household autonomy within the city, and other concepts that span the spectrum from top-down to bottom-up administrative processes. While districts at Caracol can be reconstructed through the spatial distribution of architectural features that would have provisioned urban services, no such architectural features occur uniquely at the neighborhood scale.

The case of Chunchucmil, a large Maya site located in northwest Yucatan, Mexico, challenges this common approach to neighborhood integration. At Chunchucmil, neighborhoods are clearly defined but centralized authority is not. Thus, we must set aside the question of neighborhoods being weakly or strongly integrated with centralized authority and instead ask how neighborhoods constitute authority itself. In a densely populated, decentralized city, how can neighborhoods be seen as factions whose competition and cooperation produce authority?

The settlement at El Palenque consists of a 1.6 ha civic ceremonial plaza, a 28 ha core area of residential occupation, and an additional 43.5 ha with more dispersed evidence for residential occupation. There may be a number of factors influencing the structure and distribution of neighborhoods across the site including social and political status, a need for defense, kinship organization, and specialized economic production. 

In this paper, I investigate the underlying processes shaping neighborhood organization and composition in the residential sectors of the site. I use a combination of surface collections and excavated household data to define and compare neighborhoods at El Palenque. Specifically, I analyze the distribution of house foundations, the density of different materials collected during surface collections, and house size and architecture. Through this combination of artifactual and architectural data I evaluate different models for neighborhood organization and identify the underlying processes at shaping neighborhoods at El Palenque.",2931,Symposium,Presenter,2931,Lacey,Carpenter

In some ancient cities, the urban periphery appeared as autonomous communities prior to the development of a center, representing an ‘outside-in’ model of urbanism. Such contexts provide a valuable case study for investigating neighborhood integration into cities, due to a clear comparative temporal threshold (before and after incorporation). This presentation explores how a small community transitioned into a low density urban neighborhood in a larger city, and how the local elites at its apex transformed into intermediate elites in an emergent three tier political system. The Late-Terminal Classic (AD 700-900) Maya polity of Lower Dover, Belize offers potential for examining this issue because the center arose in the midst of several long-established, Middle Preclassic (1000-400 BC) communities. This presentation identifies the ways in which the lives of the inhabitants of the Tutu Uitz Na neighborhood changed during the Late Classic as it transitioned from an autonomous community to become amalgamated into a polity. A focus on the changing wealth, status and behavior of inhabitants permits an understanding of how the neighborhood became incorporated politically, economically, ritually and socially.",2931,Symposium,Presenter,2931,John,Walden

During the Early Horizon (800-100  BC), the region witnessed the development of culturally and economically interrelated settlements with varying degrees of architectural density and complexity. Most of these centers were organized around clusters of walled enclosures with duplicate domestic facilities interpreted as multi-functional residential complexes, or compounds. Based on spatial, architectural and excavation data, these compounds are interpreted as major foci of daily activities and interactions, as well as public events housed in patios and plazas at the heart of most compounds. Depending on their scale and complexity, some of the compounds can be considered neighborhoods. In this paper, we explore what the neighborhood concept entails for these groups in terms of sociopolitical organization through a review of Early Horizon excavation and settlement pattern data. Major variables include: “compact” and “dispersed” architectural patterns; ephemeral, generational, and multi-generational architectural scales ; access patterns ; life cycles of compounds ; and material patterns of use. We compare these results with other settlements in the region in order to gain comparative insights into the diversity of residential adaptations during the first millennium BC.",2931,Symposium,Presenter,2931,Matthew,Helmer

Such fluctuations are due primarily to the inherent tension between the institutions of kinship and kingship, and consequent struggle for power in political, economic, and religious spheres. I argue that the intermediate scale of the neighborhood is best suited for analyzing how local- and state-level power structures intermix on the ground. Neighborhoods within cities capture both the everyday life of a diversity of residents, and articulate with larger state institutions and political economy. While the dynamic model is now widely accepted, very few studies show how state actors and local people actually navigate growing and waning power levels. I operationalize such dynamics through the lens of Collective Action Theory, which specifically addresses the role of state actors in the everyday life of local residents through the concept of infrastructural power. I provide a case study illustrating the actions of San Lucas residents and the Copán state during moments of very high and very low infrastructural power.

The Andes and Mesoamerica present rich and diverse examples of neighborhood organization.
Our session explores the variability in ways that the Prehispanic communities of the New World were integrated socio-politically, we see the primary methodological unit of value in this exercise to be the neighborhood, which formed the constituent units of many ancient cities.

In this paper we present archaeological and paleoethnobotanical evidence from fire features recently excavated within E-Group complexes at the sites of Early Xunantunich and Buenavista del Cayo. We argue that the characteristics of these features suggest that these fires were ritual in nature.

Recent paleoethnobotanical and archaeological studies at Tikal, however, bring some insight to this cultural black box. Three examples from the paleoethnobotanical record provide empirical evidence that indicate how the Maya elite managed their forests, set aside certain tracts of land for special agricultural projects and constructed an irrigation system to reduce the vagaries of rainfall-dependent agriculture. The first example relates to the enormous beams of sapodilla (Manilkara zapota) wood that were used to construct Temples 1-4 and only could have come from old growth forests, likely in a protected context, as in a pak’-al.

The architectural features at Mayapán are some of the most densely concentrated of sites in ancient Mesoamerica, but its organizational principles defy explanation.  Almost two decades of fieldwork, including using electronic total stations, RTK survey-grade GNSS, UAV-based aerial photography, and an aircraft-borne LiDAR survey of a 40 sq km area centered on Mayapán's defensive wall, allows mapping of much of the distribution of public architecture, dwellings, platforms, property walls, pathways, and non-residential features across the city and the region. This database is the basis for revealing the forces that drove the development of Mayapán's urban form. I focus on the role of walled pathways in relation to the locations and forms of key public architectural features, walled houselots, cenotes, the defensive wall, and major gateways.",2935,Symposium,Presenter,2935,Timothy,Hare

This introductory paper will summarize past and current perceptions of Maya urbanism, emphasizing potentially overshadowed considerations of urban planning, mobility, and community dynamics – fundamental cross-cultural features of urbanization – and their detection in lowland settlement patterns.
The recent florescence of research deriving insight from urban theory has been positive as it reminds scholars that Maya cities were urban phenomena, not simply political capitals, and must be treated as such. But the trend to emphasize monumentality in urban layout continues, to the near exclusion of other processes critical to urbanization, such as mobility, neighborhood community building, and resource management. There is a strong need for increased residential excavations across Classic urban landscapes, and we should be prepared to develop audacious programs following recent LiDAR surveys. Maya urbanism was a complex mesh of social, economic, ritual, and political networks, balanced between potentially conflicting household and social group loyalties, resulting in changing urban structures through time and space. It will require a long-term disciplinary commitment to household and neighborhood excavations to fully uncover the temporal and regional dynamics of Classic Maya urban systems.",2935,Symposium,Presenter,2935,Damien,Marken

Like in other areas of the world, the first architectural constructions at Ceibal, were public-ritual configurations, built communally by a still mobile population around 950 BC.

At Naachtun, extensive excavation programs carried out in monumental Group B, a compact set of three large elite clusters of residential compounds located in the site epicenter, and intensive test-pitting programs applied to the residential zones which surround the monumental core, have enabled us to understand the site occupation development during the Classic phases. We identify contraction, dispersal and expansion where and when most households units were occupied. We compare these space-time dynamics in epicentral Group B and surrounding urban residential zones, explore their articulation, and discuss possible intra-site population mobility. Although some of the dynamics resulted from royal-court elite attraction and urban planning, the permanence of a dense, post-dynastic occupation, and new housing practices in Group B indicate that people did not need rulers’ coercion to organize and modify their settlement in accordance with what they perceived to be their socioeconomic interests.

These communities possess their own cycles of settlement, florescence, and abandonment. Taken together, these cycles seem to show two distinct aspects that directly pertain to Classic Maya urbanism. One, it shows the urban landscape to be in a continuously changing state. The urban ruins encountered by researchers are the end product of centuries of such shifting settlement and rarely reflect contemporaneous occupation. Two, urban and hinterland communities across the city likely display a variable degree of mobility through time. The El Peru communities described in this paper appear to originate elsewhere and, after abandonment, migrate again. The shifting settlement reflects not just change over time, but mobility, a fundamental dynamic in urban settlement patterns. This paper investigates these phenomenon as evident from the archaeological record of El Perú-Waka’, Guatemala. Communities occupy a position on the landscape, sometimes marginal positions, sometimes privileged ones, and seem to insert themselves into a preexisting urban system.",2935,Symposium,Presenter,2935,Elsa,Menéndez

BLT Mapping resulted from establishing a common frame of reference to make radical comparisons between Maya and contemporary urban patterns. The anticipation of the step increase in knowledge about the spatial layout of Maya cities achieved by LiDAR surveys, makes comparative research on Maya urbanism highly relevant. Here I will examine sections of Chunchucmil’s built environment to evaluate the interpretive contribution of BLT Mapping analyses to internal comparisons of urban configurations.

The methodology explores an inhabitant’s perspective on urban life and development. BLT Mapping conceptualises urban built environments as compositions of materialised boundaries. The boundaries fix focus on the small scale urban morphology of spatial-material properties, which are mapped as socio-spatial characteristics.

The Buenavista Valley, largely controlled during the Classic period by the kingdom of El Zotz, extends out west from the great city of Tikal. However, the Preclassic city of El Palmar preceded this kingdom, established by the first lowland settlers on the western edge of a large wetland. Originally considered a minor site, LiDAR data reveals that El Palmar was in fact a sizeable early community that would have rivaled the emerging kingdom at Tikal. El Palmar was suddenly abandoned between AD 100-200 and a century later, elite settlements emerged on heavily fortified, escarpment edge hilltops. The pervasive Preclassic residential platforms on the valley floor were never matched during the Classic period. Household construction techniques varied by elevation during the Classic period, suggesting that the geopolitical interactions of the local dynasty at El Zotz did in fact affect the greater population and not simply elites.",2935,Symposium,Presenter,2935,Thomas,Garrison

Unfortunately, the majority of urban theory applied to the lowlands focuses exclusively on urban authority and power for the provisioning of resources. Such approaches offer useful discussion and debate about the scale and intensity of these systems, but provide little comparative anthropological information about the complex interactions among households, landscape, and ecology. Building on early regional archaeological science at Tikal, this paper describes and analyzes regional spatial and temporal variation of the distribution of households, land use, and resources in the region. Particular attention is paid to recent regional soil surveys as compared to what is known about settlement patterns. Emphasizing livelihoods and opportunities, the key purpose of the paper is to shift discussions in the Maya lowlands from generalized theory of urbanization, including obsolete urban and rural dichotomies, to household provisioning of food, resources, and ecosystem services.

Obviously, this is an oversimplification of a much more complex real scenario , nevertheless I consider this simple dichotomy an interesting one, mainly, because it highlights, I think, an important methodological issue: as archaeologists involved in understanding the social logic of ancient Maya urban settings, we should be able to differentiate between urban infrastructure (needed to maintain the necessary minimum conditions for human populations to thrive) and urban programs that aim to satisfy personal agendas (political or ideological in nature) in order to begin a truly comparative study of Maya urbanism and its lessons for contemporary societies.

Recently, debate has shifted from largely demographic factors to the design and planning behind Maya urban layouts. While a welcome advance for the field, design theory in the Maya lowlands has often emphasized top-down processes of dynastic intent and meaning within monumental cores, to the near exclusion of bottom-up local, regional, and hinterland processes of settlement and community adaptation, mobility, and interaction in creating the broader low-density urban forms recorded by archaeologists. Maya towns and cities were not only central places resulting from “place-making” regal policies, but also, and even primarily, were urban entities with their own internal dynamics in relation to their hinterlands.
This session will offer a broadened perspective of Maya urban design and planning, viewing bottom-up and self-organizing processes, such as household decision-making and neighborhood clustering, dispersal/contraction as integral to the development and dissolution of Classic lowland cities. These approaches highlight the flexibility of lowland urban settlements over time and emphasize applying both household and hinterland perspectives to study Classic urban society, including its eventual failure.

Such examples of retainer sacrifice, also mentioned for Aztec kings and documented in Maya tombs, raise questions about slavery, violence, and subjectivity. David Graeber has argued that slavery played a key role in the origin of commercial systems. The transition at issue concerns the melding of human economies (which make and remake relations between people) with commercial economies (which concern the acquisition of goods and wealth). Social currencies power human economies, but such money can never substitute for a person because each person and their relations are unique. Sufficient violence, however, can reduce a person to mere property, a slave. In a well-known passage from Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel states that the bondsman (the slave) has no consciousness of own: his/her essential nature is to live for the lord. Some aspects of captives and human sacrifice in the new world accord well with Graeber’s and Hegel’s position, yet there are salient differences.

Four years later on March 4, 2016 the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places officially designated Oak Flat a Traditional Cultural Property (TCP). 
The interim four years would test the fortitude of both the Forest Service and the Tribe, as Resolution Copper and other mining supporters would work creatively and persistently to prevent the formal recognition of Oak Flat as a TCP.

A key question must then also arise within any mitigation process – by whom is mitigation developed and implemented and for what and whose interests, concerns, benefits, and well-being? The bureaucratic recognition of TCPs in Bulletin 38 and in 1992 amendments to the National Historic Preservation Act have provided productive directives to identify and consider properties vital to different cultural groups. These directives have concomitantly presented a challenge to consider what sound mitigation may—or may not—be, as the significance of such places are defined far more by their integrity of associative relations.

In many cases, a range of different types of material culture are subsumed into reconstructed connections between nodes. However, not all forms of material culture are equal. Different types of objects may be caught up in rather different forms of social relationship – crudely put, ‘personal’ items such as jewellery may perhaps have more social and cultural significance than commodities, for example functional tools - and may thus be traded/exchanged/gifted in different ways. Analyses including different types of material culture may thus conflate multiple different forms of social relationship and patterns of connection. However, ‘significant’ and ‘functional’ are rarely mutually exclusive categories, and are always fluid, culturally and contextually dependent.

Counter to expectations from many contemporary network studies where brokerage positions are associated with long-term advantage, this work instead suggested that broker settlements tended to be small, short-lived, and that brokerage was temporary. This example suggests that the outcomes associated with network position are not strictly determined but that culturally and historically contingent factors can influence how the risks and rewards of network position play out. In this study we take this investigation further by exploring the changing outcomes associated with brokerage positions across a major cultural/historical transition in the northern Southwest. Specifically, we track the relationship between brokerage and settlement trajectories across the rise and fall of the Chaco World (A.D. 800-1250).

The construction of such network models will be illustrated using radiocarbon data from the Kuril Islands of Northeast Asia. Previous work in this region indicates episodic fluctuations in population density over time, with the breakdown of social networks likely playing a pivotal role in adaptive vulnerability and population decline. By creating a multivariate time series comprising thousands of fine-grained probabilistic networks, we examine long-term trends in network structure in the Kuril archipelago and interpret how these changes relate to demographic transitions.

I will focus on the material associated with Syrian cults in the Roman world, using different network approaches at a range of scales in combination to present place as a complex, ongoing result of multiple intertwined networks of experience, emotion, memory, narrative, material and landscape. Network analysis is only part of this project - which begins to look more like Ingold’s meshwork or a ‘deep map’.",2942,Symposium,Presenter,2942,Anna,Collar

Regional ceramic analyses often focus on the construction of ceramic typologies that are then used to compare typological proportions, differences, and similarities at various spatial resolutions across temporal periods. Long-standing critiques of the use of typologies and taxonomies in archaeology (sensu Brew 1946; Gnecco and Langebaek 2014; Henry et al. 2017; Wylie 1992) focus on the reifying power of their fixed nature. Essentially, typologies become the epistemologies within which we examine the archaeological record, and create the historical narrative. This can become an issue when we also acknowledge that we interpret the past through our modern framework. Thus, in order to more fully separate ourselves from the analysis of the archaeological record, or to decolonize the analysis of archaeological data (sensu Rizvi 2015), we use a networked approach to examine the distribution of ceramic attributes within and between the Antillean Islands. Our goal is to approach a more emic understanding of how communities of practice emerged and to help construct an indigenous social history prior to, and after, the violent arrival of Europeans.",2942,Symposium,Presenter,2942,Lewis,Borck

As methods in network analysis advance, the greatest promise for answering questions about the past lies in the ability to bridge approaches and analyze data from micro- to macro-scales. In this session researchers are encouraged to use network-based approaches to examine archaeological systems through multiple lenses and/or multiple scales, moving beyond reporting statistics such as centrality to interpreting their meaning in light of varied approaches. How can combining social and ecological approaches to networks help illuminate past systems? How do empirical and experimental networks differ, and what does this tell us about the past? How does looking at multiple kinds of networks in the same area help to interpret social changes? How can researchers today use quantitative output from network analysis to interpret the past and produce compelling narratives?

Paediatric hospitals were a consequence of physicians' financial aspirations rather than falsely portrayed ‘community need’ (Lomax, 1998). Their establishment contradicted longstanding attitudes surrounding children as ‘incomplete beings…whom it was wasteful to devote attention to’ (Porter, 1989). Oddly, amputation saw children harness the same attention as adults, and despite being overused, crudely performed with poor survival rates and aftercare, evidence exists of child amputees surviving into adulthood and of child prostheses. This paper will discuss complicated beliefs surrounding paediatric care in nineteenth-century Britain, concentrating on archaeological evidence of prostheses available for juvenile amputees. It asks why, in a society with poor paediatric care, was amputation and prosthesis provisioned for? What sparked the changes to children’s healthcare which saw institutions such as Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, introduced in 1852? Analysis of Victorian prosthetic devices and medical procedures will help demonstrate that whilst children occupied the role of ‘society's future’, lingering attitudes, contributed to high infant mortality rates, overcrowded workhouses and an enduring class system.

Children are vulnerable individuals and the perinatal and weaning periods are high-risk even under ideal conditions. Investigation of stress during early life is therefore vital to the characterisation of human adaptation in this region. We compared isotopic evidence for infant diet and stress with paleopathological data to assess potential changes in maternal and infant health between the pre-agricultural Archaic Period (9000 – 3500 BP) and early agricultural Formative Period (3500-1500 BP). Incremental isotopic analysis (∂N and ∂C) was conducted on 14 individuals. Results show an increase in nitrogen isotope values suggestive of maternal stress during in utero development between the Archaic and Formative Periods. Additionally, 57% of Formative Period children analysed have carbon isotope values consistent with the use of micronutrient-poor maize-based weaning foods, while Archaic period individuals appear to have been weaned onto marine resources. Paleopathological analysis of individuals from the Archaic (N =72) and Formative (N = 115) Periods shows a significant increase (X2 = 6.667; p = .010) in the prevalence of scurvy (vitamin C deficiency), a disease of low dietary diversity.

This talk will focus on a group (n=5) of incremental isotopic profiles from infants and children from the Inka period site of Camarones 9 in northern Chile. Using these profiles, we will explore how knowledge of the archaeological context, biological factors which may affect isotopic values and consideration of sociocultural theory may allow better interpretation of results.

We investigated the performances of youth participants making pottery. Three forms of social learning were observed: 1. Participants who made a bowl by copying a pre-made bowl made by the authors, 2. Participants who made a bowl while watching the authors make a bowl, and 3. Participants who made a bowl while the authors made a bowl and described the actions. The results demonstrate patterns of different mental processes, of which caused participants to apply different methods of bowl making. Rather than basing inferences of the past on assumptions of child performance, experimental studies provide a greater opportunity to develop a more concrete understanding of the material indicators that archaeologists identify to assess child performance. These questions help enhance our understanding of childcare practices and the roles of childhood agents in broader social milieus.

To support this rapidly growing industrial city, services like railways and gasworks were constructed around the city perimeter, along with housing, shops, and other services and institutions. Neighbourhoods like the industrial colony of Parkwood Springs were home to long term residents, and a growing population of families. The city authorities became concerned with the formal education of these children of the industrial city, children of the 'labouring poor'. Built initially for the children – boys, girls, and infants – of men employed in the metal trades, the Neepsend School near Parkwood Springs attracted subscribers from across the city, as well as from within Parkwood itself. The school’s situation, amongst the works of Neepsend, firmly embedded the children’s education within the industrial cityscape. As an institution for the care as well as education, the building was carefully spatially divided and managed, communicating social behaviour as well as industrial training. Employing standing building survey, GIS, and archival research, this paper will examine the site of Neepsend School.

Stage classification alone is limiting in terms of allowing us to broaden our understanding and interpretation of the archaeological record.  We suggest projectile point preforms are useful proxies of skill and that the majority of complete preforms left in the archaeological record were terminal artifacts with so many mistakes they could not have been finished; hence they remain as complete preforms in the record. The use of refined terminology along with the implementation of the theoretical framework of the chaîne opératoire, careful technological assessments and recognition of the importance of lithic scatters gives us the opportunity to present more holistic site interpretations.

The most vulnerable of these die in this period, characterized as the “valley of death,” which represents a biocultural reality. The majority of those who survive are “vulnerable survivors.” The Kellis 2 cemetery sample (Dakhleh Oasis, Egypt, AD 50-450) provides a unique opportunity to analyze effects of biocultural disruptions occurring during this critical period of physiological adjustment. Maternal, fetal, and infant (N=210) 13C and 15N profiles were produced from hair, dentin collagen, and bone collagen to evaluate adverse biological factors simultaneously present during weaning and illness. Results indicate there are three situations where feeding practices and health interact: first, the mother’s ability to meet nutritional demands of infants during prolonged breastfeeding; second, undernutrition due to a health insult when the child is losing passive immunity; third, children being weaned on foods lacking protein quality and content when they may already be undernourished.

Six human skeletons that were similarly processed in a neighboring suite were also surveyed for insect damage. Gnaw marks were examined under a stereomicroscope using 10-40x magnification. A feeding experiment with housed roaches demonstrated this insect’s ability to modify bone. Locations of extensive roach feeding appeared superficially similar to small rodent gnawing, but the two agents were clearly separable under low magnification. Roach mandibular scrapings and their patterns were similar to those previously reported for termites. This study shows the widely distributed American cockroach can and will modify thin cortical bone and underlying trabeculae; and suggests this highly omnivorous species favors soft tissue and bone lipids. Significantly, roaches are potential agents of bone modification of vertebrate carcasses that decay in subaerial or shallow burials.",2944,Symposium,Presenter,2944,Jennifer,Synstelien

A review of assemblages, however, indicates that while there are a high percentage of heavily fragmented medium-sized and larger mammal bone at many of these sites, bones associated with small mammals, reptiles, avian, and fish have only minimal fragmentation. A review of bone from a variety of sites with deep temporal and well-stratified context and of varying degree of preservation and fragmentation from Central and North Texas including 41DL436 (Fish Creek Slough Site), 41TR203 (Mercado Site), 41HM51, and 41WM1126 (Siren Site) are examined and contrasted. Differences in taphonomic versus human imposed bone breakage for each site are presented. Patterns in temporal variations and overall frequencies of fragmentation combined with evidence for intentional fracturing are identified to examine trends and shifts in, and methods for, marrow and bone grease extraction in Central and North Texas through time. These trends are placed within a greater context of environmental changes and reviewed as potential indicators of dietary stress and shifts in subsistence resource availability.

Huaca Negra is a fishing village locates in the northwest of the Virú Valley and is 1.2 kilometers from the current shoreline. The site was occupied between 5,000-3,200 CalBP, from Late Preceramic Period to Initial Period, which witnessed the transitions from non-sedentary activity to a settled village, from sedentism to the construction of the mound, and finally from the usage to the abandonment of the mound. 
Along with these social changes, the long-term occupation provides a unique opportunity to study early coastal life. The comparison of four activities (fishing, shellfish collecting, hunting, and planting) and its diachronic change help to reveal the nature of subsistence system in both Late Preceramic and Initial Period. The preferred catchment zones, change of coping strategy and the implication of social change will also be addressed.

BC divided into two phases, the CV-1 phase and the CV-2 phase. We conducted a stratigraphic examination of these contexts, and carried out radio carbon dating to further analyze the processes of constructing mound and its change over time. These analyses revealed that accumulation of food waste midden and embedded mortuary contexts caused the growing of mound volume in the CV-1 phase, and the abruptly change to the beginning of architecture construction on the mound: an activity of constructing a room and the reconstructions of floors and walls which led to the division of inside space in the CV-2 phase. These processes indicate that the monumentality of mounds gradually increased in the CV-1 phase as the mortuary and food waste accumulating practice, and the increased monumentality caused the change of the utilization of this place around 2800 cal.

Controversy surrounds interpretations, owing to incongruities between archaeological and textual data as well as disagreements over how to weight the disparate observations made in these documents. Modern researchers variably evaluate the biases, motives, and the overall truthfulness of the authors of these documents. Another issue is the general subjectivity involved in fitting non-systematic observations into pre-existing anthropological models; usually some support can be found for almost any position. This presentation will attempt to address some of these issues by applying a formulaic approach to the weighting of document subject matter. While there is still subjectivity involved in the method, it provides a consistent and replicable means of evaluating the importance of different themes in a text. These themes can then be interpreted to infer both biases of the author and the relative significance of observations regarding Indigenous social organization. A trial attempt at this approach supports many pre-existing interpretations but also suggests some of the topics previously identified as paramount in the social organization of Contact era Sonora are of secondary importance.

The Rio Chama valley was a population center with 12 villages housing thousands of people at the beginning of the fifteenth century. By century’s end it was nearly devoid of full-time habitation. The timing and causes of the protohistoric ‘abandonment’ of the Chama has sparked interest from archaeologists and historians. Was this movement out of the Chama the continuation of a centuries-long process of Pueblo coalescence, or rather a response to early Spanish contact and colonization? The latter idea is bolstered by the fact that the Chama is the ancestral homeland of Ohkay Owingeh where Governor Oñate established the first capitol of New Mexico in 1598. 

I reframe this debate by assuming that the Chama was never abandoned. Based on archaeological, historic, and ethnographic documentation the Chama remains the heart of Ohkay Owingeh’s cosmography, and was visited and occupied throughout the Historic period.

Although, we have long been outspoken critics of this concept, supposedly, the renowned cacique Sisibotari counted some 70 settlements within his dominion (Spicer 1962:92), and requested Pérez de Ribas send missionaries to his people; we suspect that when Pedro Méndez established missions in Bacanora, Sahuaripa and Arivechi, these localities fell within Sisibotari’s dominion, and would seemingly indicate a semi-complex level of socio-political organization. This paper presents recent archaeological investigations in the Sahuaripa region. These data, along with the ethnohistorical accounts, indicate that this region was densely populated and figured prominently in regional and long-distance exchange systems in Northwest Mexico and likely served as the principal route followed by the early Spaniards.",2948,Symposium,Presenter,2948,John,Carpenter

Ethical anthropologists in North America recognize that they need to secure tribal/First Nations permission for their research.  Sometimes permission is granted only for projects of interest to the tribes themselves. And sometimes publication of that research for a wider audience may be restricted or denied. But the benefits of collaboration result in a much richer understanding of Native and non-Native relations, one informed and shaped by the perspectives of Native people themselves.
 The Hopi Tribe of Arizona has been insisting on such collaboration for decades now. Nonetheless, some scholars working on the Hopi people continue to ignore such ethical guidelines and understandings.  We argue that Southwestern archaeology, cultural anthropology, and ethnohistory will never progress beyond the limitations of Western epistemologies and lines of evidence biased by Western ethnocentrism and silences until collaboration is embraced and institutionalized as the only ethical and productive way to understand our shared pasts and presents.

The corn dance may occur at other times as well, but without a linkage to the village patron saint. A number of diverse factors, however, indicate that this dance as known today is a post-Hispanic aspect of Pueblo ceremonialism.  In addition to the dance’s obvious link to the Catholic patron saint of each Pueblo, is the bannered standard of proposed native Mexican origin, and finally the absence in prehispanic Pueblo art for the distinctive iconography of this dance.

Initially we describe Comcaac historical accounts about the “Cazoopin” (Spaniards) that mention first encounters with Spanish sailing ships and their opportunistic adoption of Spanish material culture. We then discuss the relevance of place and routes among the different historical narratives. To finalize with a discussion on how, both Comcaac oral accounts and the documentary record, provide ample descriptions of leaders. It is argued that the importance of Comcaac masculine war leaders is a cultural practice similar in some respects to Spanish and Western emphases on prominent individuals. Through collaboration multiple spatial and temporal configurations documented in our research provide unique insights into the role of subject/object-place relationships and practice in cultural continuity, tradition, and cultural transformation.

It critically focuses on previous classificatory systems of Olmec deities. Iconographers often identify individual deities on the basis of defining attributes or material accoutrements, frequently extending these identifications across contexts (as in Covarrubias’ famous “evolution of the Mesoamerican rain god”). However, building in part on Eva Hunt’s work, we find that the conflation or sharing of attributes among Formative period entities casts doubt on the validity of classificatory schemes that fail to adequately consider the fluidity of deities or their relationship to that which they personify. This “conceptual overlap” in Olmec art may lead to confusion, misidentification, or overly simplistic interpretations. It is argued that the construction of deity systems should consider such conceptual overlaps in representational art, in order to more fully unpack the multiple, non–hierarchical levels of significance imbricated in images of gods and supernaturals, as well as the dynamism of such representations within larger symbolic complexes. A range of data from various contexts are considered in an effort to evaluate the utility of cross–cultural analogies in comparative iconography.",2949,Symposium,Presenter,2949,Joshua,Englehardt

This presentation will reassess this interpretation, taking into account new archaeological data alongside well-known pictorial and textual sources.

Weakly defined by a set of slippery contrasts - isolated from what came before and what comes after - the descriptor lacks robust categorization of its own.

This paper begins the process of defining Epi-Olmec in its own right. Whether understood primarily as a time period, geographic region, visual culture program, or hieroglyphic system, Epi-Olmec art and writing have much to offer the study of early Mesoamerican material culture. Rather than setting Epi-Olmec apart from more robustly-defined predecessors, neighbors, and successors, this paper will use Epi-Olmec visual culture to inform upon them. What connections can be drawn, for example, between Epi-Olmec forms and Classic Veracruz deities? How might an understanding of Classic Veracruz iconography illuminate the complexities of Epi-Olmec supernaturals?

Veracruz, a region implicated via the activities of both avatars, is particularly enmeshed in this duality.

The Postclassic narrative whereby Quetzalcoatl journeyed to the Gulf lowlands appears to be foreshadowed in the desacralization of Teotihuacan’s Feathered Serpent Pyramid at the end of the third century AD. This ritual destruction has been linked to a political realignment at Teotihuacan, instigating the departure of refugee groups who fled the Basin of Mexico.

The founding of Classic Period Matacapan, in the Tuxtla Mountains of southern Veracruz, may have been linked to this exodus. This paper considers the regional impact of this relocation via the appearance of Quetzalcoatl imagery along the Veracruz lowlands, both through overt representations as well as potential proxies (e.g., Reptile Eye glyph, Venus symbolism, the ehecacozcatl “wind jewel”). Variations in how Feathered Serpent imagery is manifest could well reflect autochthonous lowland ideals versus notions related to an intrusive highland cosmovision. Thus, not all Quetzalcoatl imagery is equal, nor is it equally unfettered.

As costume elements, these sculptures would have allowed actors to assume the identity of captives, rulers, or deities. This accords well with iconographic evidence of ballgame-related ritual performances in Veracruz, and suggests comparisons with artworks from other Mesoamerican cultures, in which rulers impersonate deities in performances associated with the ballgame. In this paper, I suggest that deity impersonation and performance are productive lenses through which to interpret ballgame-related sculpture, including yokes, hachas, and palmas. I examine a corpus of stone sculpture from Classic-period Veracruz, considering how such sculpture may have been used to invoke the presence of specific deities, and what it can tell us about the role of those deities in Veracruz culture.

In the central highlands of Peru, local groups developed and participated in a revitalization movement which preached the rejection of Spanish goods, culture, and religion, in favor of a return to huaca (local deity) worship.

Excavations at the site of Iglesiachayoq (Ayacucho, Peru), a known Taki Onqoy center, demonstrate a varied response to Spanish conversion—while some appear to have fully committed to the movement, others were caught between Spanish authorities and local takiongos, and strove to placate both sides.

Yet these groups persisted in settlement structure, religious practices, and even in the funerary realm well into the first centuries C.E. Through the lens of colonial negotiation, it also becomes clear that the islands contained multiple groups of varying identities that cannot be simply understood as broadly “Talayotic.” This paper will examine the ritual evidence from sites on Mallorca and Menorca to understand the varying expressions of these island communities during this period of outside interaction at the end of the first millennium B.C.E.",2950,Symposium,Presenter,2950,Alexander,Smith

This is especially true following the Roman conquest of Iberia in the late 3rd century BCE, when the scale of mining increased dramatically to accommodate the growing needs of the Roman Empire. This was made possible through dramatic shifts in the organization of labor and the technological practices surrounding mining. Scholars often attribute these changes to Roman innovation, ignoring the long-term history of indigenous mining in many areas and the potential significance of local people in the successes of the industry. In this paper, I challenge this conventional interpretation and explore the diverse contributions of local people to the mining industry, from their knowledge of local resource distribution to their work as laborers in mining and subsidiary industries. I argue that Roman conquest transformed the everyday lives of local people, who in turn participated in the diverse communities of practice in Roman mining landscapes, contributing knowledge, skills, and resources that fueled this industry so key to the creation of the Roman Empire.

Most research has focused on the large Wari installations built in several regions of Peru, leading many scholars to conclude that Wari administrators established direct imperial control over these areas. More recently, scholars have started to adopt a complementary bottom-up approach to study changes experienced at the regional and household levels by smaller communities living outside the large Wari installations. This new perspective challenges previous interpretations of Wari as a strong, centralized, all-controlling colonial authority. In the Cusco region, survey and excavation data suggest that local populations were little affected by Wari presence. Continuity in settlement patterns and domestic and ritual activities reveal that locals did not adopt Wari practices. Like other early states worldwide, the Wari polity might have built enclaves that helped its settlers tap into the knowledge, authority, and networks of local elites. Obsidian, hallucinogenic snuff, and other exotic goods from Cusco further demonstrate that Wari colonists did not interrupt regional and long-distance exchange networks, but might have intensified prestige-goods competition and altered the balance of power among local societies.",2950,Symposium,Presenter,2950,Véronique,Bélisle

The IAP refutes dominant historical narratives surrounding the antiquity and nature of the highland Ifugao and their rice terraces. Rather than a people isolated from time and conquest, the IAP findings show that the Ifugao mobilized behind a concerted economic, political, and environmental restructuring as a pericolonial response to Spanish activities in the lowlands.

The south coast of Peru was one of the regions conquered relatively early by the expanding Inca state. Following incorporation, a series of Inca administrative centers were established, all linked by a highway. Tambo Viejo was established in the Acarí Valley. The south coast in general being incorporated peacefully, the control exercised by the Inca state likely was through local authorities. However, Inca control was brief and at most probably lasted no more than fifty years. As a result, the residents of valleys such as Acarí experienced little change in their daily life. The architecture of Tambo Viejo and the associated ceramics do not exhibit much outside influence. Though material items display only minor changes, Inca ideology is apparent in the manner in which the center was planned. Tambo Viejo, although built with architecture in the local tradition, was conceived following the standardized Inca structural pattern that included a large rectangular plaza and an enormous mound that likely was an ushnu.

In lithic research, archaeological science studies have investigated topics ranging from identifying raw material sources, assessing artefact function and technology, to modelling socio-cultural and evolutionary changes. However, this method-centred definition of archaeological science has also led to a focus on the “sciency” appeal of techniques over basic principles of the general science method, namely falsification (“how do I know if I am wrong?”) and validation against uncertainty (“how confident can I be in my explanation as opposed to other explanations?”). Despite the flourish of archaeological science, much of lithic research still operate on analytical units embedded with implicit behavioural assumptions that are difficult to falsify, and a largely common-sensical reasoning process that favours explanations relatable to our modern daily experience. By reviewing other archaeological science approaches, it is argued here that a more explicit discussion of the general science framework is needed in lithic research, with particular concern over the nature of analytical categories, the integrity and confidence of inference, and the ability to objectively evaluate competing causal explanations for the formation of archaeological pattern through multiple lines of evidence.",2952,Symposium,Presenter,2952,Sam,Lin

The first one deals with the circulation of iron products in the North-Alpine area during the end of the First Iron Age (6th-5th c. BC). The second one concerns the use of iron reinforcements in the gothic monuments and cathedrals of the Middle Age in France. Finally, several prospects will be proposed for developing integrated and interdisciplinary provenance studies in the future.

",Other,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis: Glass Analysis,Craft Production,"Scientific investigation of archaeological glass has advanced, beginning in the early 2000’s, with studies relying more heavily on determination of trace element concentrations to differentiate production recipes depending on distinct ingredient sources and the use of larger corpuses of artifacts to more easily and reliably reveal production patterns.  At the same time, isotope analyses (e.g., Pb, Sr and Nd) attempting to source raw materials used to manufacture glass in antiquity grew in importance, focusing mostly on glass produced around the Mediterranean basin.

In a new project, recently funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), we will combine trace element and isotope analyses to study the ancient glass industry of South Asia which, despite its importance and impact within and beyond the Indian Ocean region, is still poorly understood.  To this end, we will collect raw materials, test their suitability to obtain glass and compare the trace element and isotope signatures with those of different South Indian glass types.  By connecting Indian glass types to potential production regions in South Asia, the results of this project will illuminate the spatial and temporal interconnections between cultures and regions of the Indian Ocean and beyond.

Environmental history study agreed that during this period, mineral coal replaced charcoal and became the main fuel of metal industry in China. Our investigation however reveals this is a rather complex and uneven process. In the more arid and densely populated north China coal-fired tubular crucibles were widely adopted in this period. In contrast, the south China smelters continued the more traditional furnace smelting process. More interestingly, crucible technology seems not to be embraced by iron and copper smelters until early modern period.

This terminology simultaneously ignores the unique aspects of Irish social and cultural life while suggesting that any study of culture there is not relevant to a broader understanding of the human experience. However, the archaeological record suggests a situation which is more nuanced and so more complex than this terminology would imply. Ireland clearly participated in a wider cultural world while also expressing its own unique identity. These issues will be explored specifically in the context of Iron Age ritual in Ireland, where evidence suggests that cultural and social identity were being actively fashioned. Using data from excavation at the Iron Age ceremonial center of Dún Ailinne, Co.

This suggests that a culturally blended presentation had been adopted for the performative aspects of the foodway.

The dominant interpretive models have emanated from Wessex – that area of central southern England where the largest and most impressive hillforts are found. In recent decades, however, archaeologists have increasingly recognised the marked regional differences inherent in Iron Age societies across different parts of Britain. As a result, the conventional, Wessex-dominated models have fallen from favour and been replaced by a myriad of regionally-focussed analyses. This approach, however, has its own problems. Different regions of Britain might have very different archaeological sequences in the Iron Age, yet there are some traits (including the uptake of continental La Tène art styles, the paucity of visible burial rites and the use of the roundhouse as the normative domestic form), that display a layer of cultural unity underlying this apparent variation.

The centrality of this notion to the definition of the Bronze Age has resulted in numerous studies addressing such large-scale exchange of material culture and/or ideology.

In particular, it considers whether the studies of long-distance interaction tend to homogenize Britain and Ireland under the umbrella of southern England, resulting in the glossing over of the rest of Britain and Ireland as marginal and insignificant, or in the blanket attribution of southern English characteristics to Britain and Ireland as a whole.

Given clear evidence of biotic habitability along the entire Corridor before 13,000 years ago, along with early hunting in its southern funnel, moderately dense fluted point clusters likely reflect both Clovis contemporaneous and later fluted point instances. These points were overwhelmingly fashioned on local toolstones, featuring a bimodal length distribution of some larger, relatively unaltered fluted points, plus many reworked, smaller fluted points at the end of their use life. Corridor fluted points are generally found in tertiary landscape settings rather than major kills or campsites. Consistently wide point bases (on average, greater than 26 mm) imply that shaft morphology remained little changed in the hunting of game animals including horses, bison, camels, sheep and caribou. Fluted point makers traversing the Corridor eventually met populations bearing eastern Beringian traditions; determining the degree to which diffusion or demic expansion mediated north-south interactions is a research priority. A template featuring deeper U- and V-shaped bases with multiple flutes was at play, creating geographically intermediate forms decidedly similar to Younger Dryas-aged Alaskan fluted points.",2955,Symposium,Presenter,2955,John W.,Ives

At some point they abandoned their arctic-based tool complex for one more adapted to an entirely different environment. The dispersal of that new techno-complex — Clovis — allows us to examine, at a fine scale, how colonization processes played out across a vast continent that at the time had at best a very small resident population. Clovis has figured prominently in American archaeology since the first Clovis points were identified in eastern New Mexico in the 1930s, but the successful marriage of learning models grounded in evolutionary theory and modern analytical methods that began roughly a decade ago has begun to pay significant dividends in terms of what we know about the rapid spread of human groups across the last sizeable landmass to witness human occupation.

One effective way to understand this diversity is by tracking broad-scale morphological variation in suites of point traits to build cultural lineages. In this paper, we take a more trait-specific approach. We trace changes in projectile point design to understand the evolution of specific point attributes that were under selection. Through this approach, we explore when and where certain aspects of point design were adopted, what traits were linked or co-adopted, and how these traits may have influenced point function.

Assemblages from the Argentinian pampas include small, medium and large points, produced either on a flake blank or by bifacial thinning on a biface, with or without fluting, with rounded or angular shoulders, that is, presenting variable sizes, design and manufacturing techniques. These variations were partly the result of the production of objects intended for different functions and partly of point life history. Regarding this life history, we here address a conservative strategy affecting Fishtail points in several localities in South America: recycling. Under the term recycling, we consider points modified by retouch to produce a different tool. Fifteen artifacts recovered at Cerro El Sombrero Cima, representing 16% of the point assemblage at the site, are considered recycled tools made on Fishtail points. They were identified through macroscopic observation of traits on edges and tips and the general artifact shape; possible uses of these recycled tools are studied through fatty acid analysis.

Comparative studies have often proven difficult in part because of the diverse nature of Paleoindian biface technologies in North America. While morphological ratios such as length-to-width vary considerably throughout biface use-lives, technological ratios related to fluting and lateral grinding typically remain more constant. In turn, technological variables may be more meaningful, and have the potential to inform us about decision making processes related to lithic technologies, i.e. when bifaces were discarded versus refurbished. The study sample analyzed here was selected to minimize external factors that could influence biface manufacture, such as raw material availability and package size. Fluted Clovis and Cumberland bifaces from the Lower Tennessee River Valley were selected because of the abundance of toolstone that is readily accessible throughout the region.

From this comfortable position, archaeologists have failed to challenge the Western cultural basis for these “issues”.

These challenges generate wide-ranging questions: Is this unavoidable? Who is ultimately responsible? Are some groups more deserving of analysis than others? What research is prioritized when money is scarce? Professional codes of ethics provide an insufficient framework for responding to these questions, resulting in inadvertent entrenchment that limits the scope of potential hypotheses and epistemic growth and overlooks the power of counter-narratives. The archaeology of historic cemeteries is uniquely placed for social engagement.

However, the exact patterns of prosperity varied between residential groups. In contrast, elite residences show evidence of abandonment and reoccupation while the noble residence was occupied for a relatively short period. Elite and noble trajectories appear to have been strongly tied to shifting power structures, whereas commoner trajectories were less dependent on political transitions.

My research is informed by collective action theory, and the degree to which leaders engaged in exclusionary and inclusive practices over the site’s 2000 years of occupation. Findings have not supported my original exclusive power hypothesis in which early rulers circumvented kin-based authority by out-competing and fragmenting established households. Instead, the small number of founding elite and commoner houses enjoyed socio-economic prosperity during the Terminal Preclassic period when kingship was institutionalized. The rise to regional authority was rapid at Actuncan, which was built by burying an earlier settlement and greatly expanding civic structures. This expansion was achieved through inclusive practices that mobilized hinterland populations’ labor and loyalties. Later, Classic-period elites experienced boom-and-bust cycles of growth and abandonment, which I argue is the result of elite competition for exclusive power.

Such high levels of redeposited domestic trash, and the arrangement of these plots, suggest that agricultural and water drainage activity took place at an intra-household or larger community level. In addition, a number of linear cobble mounds have been found east of Actuncan along the Mopan River floodplain. Based on soil chemistry and proximity to the river, this area may have been used as a cacao orchard, thus creating an economic opportunity that could have benefitted the entire community. Together, these systems reflect how the ancient Maya at Actuncan managed water and agricultural production, and the scale at which these technologies were administered.

The literature on ancient Maya urbanism focuses to a large extent on how urban spaces are arranged and what this says about social and political organization. However, the long occupations of many Maya centers resulted in urban centers that reflect a palimpsest of decision-making over centuries rather than a single grand plan. Indeed, evidence at many Maya sites suggests that urban plans were reworked as buildings were built, destroyed, renovated, repurposed, and abandoned based on present needs. So-called “problematical deposits”—detritus left in and on abandoned spaces and buildings—provide evidence that the later Maya acknowledged the differentially utilized nature of their urban centers. Yet, modifications to the urban landscape result from decisions made by someone: households, communities, leaders, or conquerors.

Eastern structures were used to bury revered ancestors in the Belize River Valley, but nearly all of the Actuncan Group 1 burials were disturbed by later burials. When was it acceptable to disturb an ancestor, and how did appropriate treatment of the dead change after burial? This paper explores the relationship between burial practices and the identities of the dead, including osteological analysis of early childhood health and evidence for diet and migration using strontium, carbon, and oxygen isotopes. The re-use of important places over generations shows how ancestors played a role in maintaining memory in the urban landscape.",2957,Symposium,Presenter,2957,Carolyn,Freiwald

Maya populations throughout Mesoamerica were united by a shared cosmology patterning the timing, location, and material aspects of ritual performance. Yet, ritual was not a static or rigid construct, dutifully replicated across populations. At the site of Actuncan, Belize, we find that aspects of domestic ritual cycles, - including form, content, placement, and frequency, - show a flexible, even creative approach to ritual. In each foundation, renovation, and termination of a house, the inhabitants had the opportunity to carry out rites before groups of varying sizes, conveying a sense of community in some and distinction in others. These performances, and their material remains, were key components in the literal and figurative construction of the Actuncan community, as commoner and elite households actively reworked architectural forms and ritual templates to either perpetuate existing identities or signal new trajectories. This paper examines household ritual deposits associated with construction events as resources used to different ends by elites and commoners to negotiate interactions between existing physical structures on the landscape and sociopolitical structures in the Actuncan community.",2957,Symposium,Presenter,2957,Borislava,Simova

Archaeological evidence suggests that each of these centers was initially occupied by the Middle Preclassic, but they had distinct histories, evolving into ceremonial/political centers at different times, from the Middle Preclassic to the Late Classic.  Additionally, the decline, collapse and eventual abandonment of these ceremonial centers occurred at different times and with varying impact on nearby hinterland communities.  In this paper we present archaeological data from the Mopan Valley in order to place the site of Actuncan within this regional history.

These negotiations must be viewed as iterative—informed in each instance by internal political dynamics, community practices, and local memory, as well as outside influences. The result is a palimpsest urbanism where residents lived in a historic center in which monuments, houses, and agricultural systems were built, occupied, renovated, and differentially abandoned according to existing conditions.

As cultural sites are subjected to destructive processes, action is generally limited to mitigation and salvage of immediately threatened significant sites, while their destruction by the resettlement of affected communities has been given little attention. This secondary impact of climate change threatens sites outside of the immediate zone of flooding and erosion. Given the importance of cultural heritage sites to descendent communities, and their preservation of paleoclimatic and environmental records in association with the record of human settlements over millennia, it is imperative that we develop standard methods for assessing destruction risk of archaeological sites within a climate change framework. Using Casco Bay area in Maine as a pilot study, this study develops a methodology for integrating decadal-to-centennial climate change projections, socio-economic and demographic data, and state and federal land use and cultural resource management regulations to create a robust, user-friendly risk assessment framework.

The projects drew upon more than a century of prior field research, where four generations of archaeologists described and assessed organic preservation conditions at their sites in several regions of the Norse Eastern Settlement. This created a unique form of “archaeological TEK” (Traditional Ecological Knowledge) that represents an invaluable guide into the changing preservation conditions since late 19th century.

Between 2005-2017 we conducted extensive coring surveys of over 100 Norse middens, and open area and small test excavations at over 15 sites.  The results show a shocking and almost complete loss of once outstanding organic preservation in a region where only 60 years ago wood, bones, leather, wool, and feathers were recovered. Our findings draw attention to the destructive process of the modern climate change that has been affecting the organic preservation conditions for at least 60 years, and to the need to organize a circumpolar-wide, international response strategy to rescue the endangered sites and their unique cultural heritage before it is too late.

However, archaeologists have historically focused attention on monumental public spaces within large civic-ceremonial centers, and relatively little attention has been given to public spaces within rural communities. Yet it is at these public structures and spaces that entanglements of both top-down and bottom-up processes are visible to archaeologists. To explore the ways in which hinterland or ‘rural’ communities may integrate and articulate with larger ‘heartland’ seats of power, this paper will examine one such public group at the hinterland site of San Lorenzo, Belize. Data demonstrates that this group was used and modified by the local community from the Preclassic to the Terminal Classic periods.

",Maya: Classic,Survey,Settlement Patterns,"The Classic Maya, with their towering jungle temples and sprawling cities have been the focus of archaeological studies since the mid-1800s. Although numerous investigations have fostered considerable insights, important questions remain regarding the circumstances in which these settlements originated, interacted, developed, and were ultimately abandoned. The organization of Maya settlements is best conceptualized as a continuum consisting of three basic, but variable types, including: upper-level, middle-level, and lower-level settlements. This discussion reviews the primary research results for the full-coverage survey and test-excavation program conducted at the middle-level hinterland settlement of Waybil, Belize, Central America. The overall result was the collection of valuable information concerning the development of the central courtyard, peripheral settlement groups, and relic agricultural terraces found within the site. Middle-level settlements such as Waybil are unique units within the continuum as they are smaller and more specialized than upper-level settlements, but larger and more diverse than lower-level settlements. Thus, they are thought to have performed distinct roles and functions within the greater settlement matrix. Exploring the configuration of individual middle-level settlements is essential to improving our knowledge of ancient Maya socio-political and socio-economic interactions, hinterland archaeology, human-environment adaptive strategies, and the circumstances surrounding the Classic period “collapse”.

The definition of others and self is largely relational and comparative. Archaeologists demonstrate Maya elite identity by comparing them to non-elites in terms of energy expenditure in burial preparation, house and platform construction, access to luxury items, and cranial and dental modifications. Although non-elites include some urban residents and all hinterland residents, this study proposes that some hinterland residents also identified as elites. The Medicinal Trail Community is a hinterland settlement with considerable variation in household complexity, ranging from simple perishable structures informally arranged, to households on elevated platforms formally arranged around a courtyard. The latter residents attempted to adopt the social identity of the urban elites by using the symbols and material culture of the “Urban Elites,” therefore becoming “Hinterland Elites.”  As a result, these “Hinterland Elites” economic and socio-political status was elevated above most of the community’s inhabitants, providing them with limited social power.

Indeed, the histories and processes associated with settler colonization in the Caribbean, including indigenous displacement, forced migration of Africans and the appropriation of land and labor of both made it untenable to employ strategies that equated culture, biology, and language. The model helped archaeologists imagine, if not analyze, a less static understanding of social, political, and economic boundaries that shaped the colonial past. In this paper I build on this scholarship to consider a longer term set of processes that shaped Dominica’s landscape in the early modern period and that continue to reverberate today. Specifically, I rely on linguistic and archaeological evidence to parse some of the historical threads and relations of power.",2962,Symposium,Presenter,2962,Mark,Hauser

",Contact Period,Ethnohistory/History,Identity/Ethnicity,"Scholarly interest utilizing archaeological and ethnohistorical studies to understand the genesis and development of Caribbean creole societies has grown in the last few years. Perspectives have shifted to emphasize the diversity of groups in the Caribbean during precolonial times, and how this continued into the colonial period as Europeans and Africans coalesced in the area. The conflictual aspect of this interaction whereby Europeans imposed a system of forced labor, along with drastic Indian population losses have obscured the contributions of indigenous peoples to colonial societies and culture.
This paper summarizes archaeological and historical data for Puerto Rico and Hispaniola on the diversity of Indian groups in the early colonial period and the different ways they reacted and responded to Old World peoples. It postulates the concept of cultural transformation to explain the process of change occurring among these populations, and how they employed strategies which varied from island to island. It discusses the evidence for the persistence of Indian groups well into the colonial period and what this may imply for the formation of creole societies, and ends with a call for further archaeological research focusing on early colonial sites.",2962,Symposium,Presenter,2962,Karen,Anderson-Cordova

In Cuba this category was transformed over the last five centuries and adjusted to various historical  circumstances. The historical and archaeological data of the Island indicate that the Indians did not maintain a passive attitude against the colonial power. They confronted or  learned to interact with him and sought mechanisms of survival.

Current archaeological investigations of the initial period of colonial settlement on Barbados focusing on Trents Plantation, and the pre-sugar era (1627-1640s) project an all-together different picture. The archaeological and historical record projects a multivalent, multicultural, mix of engagements between Indigenous, African, and European settlers. This complexity is expressed in the material record, particularly with the mix of locally produced and imported ceramics from the early 17th century plantation context at Trents.  The emerging colony on Barbados was English in name, but backed by the Dutch, and assisted by a group of Indigenous people who joined them from Guyana and Africans captured from a Portuguese ship.  Moreover, this colony was established in the 17th century Caribbean, a theater contested by the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and English, as well as a complex array of Indigenous peoples.  The result was the construction of a complex multi-vocal cultural ensemble of cultural and material expressions that is consistent with the dynamic cultural diversity that emerged in the region.

What experimental studies indicate is that we can isolate patterns of feeding associated with particular carnivores, but what has not been demonstrated is whether we see differences between domestic and wild canids. We propose that one solution is to move beyond the marks on the bone and look at where they are found in campsites. Through our ongoing ethnoarchaeological study of the Dukha reindeer herders of north-central Mongolia, we use GPS tracking, photogrammetry, and mapping of canids and modified bone to isolate spatial patterning of domestic dog behavior.

The very fact that such sites may represent short-term, low density occupations means that the configuration of labor and activities may actually be clearer than in longer-term open-air or architectural sites, where accumulated activities create more ambiguous palimpsests. The content and configuration of occupied surfaces offer not only information about activities carried out there, but also the potential for interpreting the role of site usage within a larger settlement pattern. Even otherwise sedentary agricultural societies may have mobile components that fulfill other roles in their settlement and subsistence systems.

AD 1400 and then left the region en masse ca. AD 1650, becoming one of several contemporary Central Algonquian tribes.  However, new data raise the possibility that this interpretation needs revision.  First, through a biodistance analysis we learn that at least some Anderson and Madisonville groups were not closely related biologically.  Second, we know from oral histories that Dhegiha Siouans departed the Ohio Valley at the same time as the Madisonville shift and have recently learned that the Anderson pattern is very similar to several Dhegiha accounts.  Hence, it is now possible to question whether the Anderson cultural system relates to Dhegiha Siouans moreso than the Madisonville one that may be more closely related to Central Algonquians.  Reasons explored to account for the potential for multiple departures include various mixes of environmental and cultural push/pull factors, such as deteriorating climatic conditions for agriculture, increased interest in bison, and increased pressures from Iroquoians who were interested in the region for both the burgeoning fur trade and slave raiding.",2965,Symposium,Presenter,2965,Robert,Cook

Excavations at the site by the Smithsonian in the late nineteenth century recovered a Middle Cumberland-style statue from a platform mound. Excavations in 1941, by Works Progress Administration crews supervised by University of Tennessee archaeologists, recovered pottery samples with some Middle Cumberland characteristics from three platform mounds and a large wall-trench structure near these mounds.

These settlements include small farmsteads, palisaded villages, and sites with platform mounds.  In addition to the Pisgah culture, the late Mississippian Qualla phase (1450 -1838 CE)  represents the only other Mississippian society in the Appalachian Summit.  These communities are contemporaneous with Late Pisgah sites to the north, sharing similar house architecture and pottery attributes.  However, Qualla sites are restricted to river valleys within the southwest while Pisgah pottery is found across a much larger area of the greater southern Appalachians. These two Mississippian complexes maintained a spatial separation within areas where both pottery types are found.  With cycles of more or less integration of Mississippian groups, the period of 1300-1500 CE was a complex and dynamic period of interaction and growth in the Appalachian Summit.

At the time of the Harappan occupation of this region (4th to 2nd millennia BCE), Gujarat was home to a number of localized ceramic traditions. Overtime, this area came to represent a mix of both traditional cultural expressions of Harappan stylistic norms as well as regional appropriations and adaptations of Harappan ceramic style and technology. This unique cultural landscape developed as a result of different forms of cultural processes, whether it be emulation, knowledge transfer, or shared aesthetics.

Known as Magan in Mesopotamian texts, a considerable amount of research has been conducted on Bronze Age Oman by focusing on its external connections to other polities. In this paper, I present an alternative, hyper-local perspective on the archaeology of this area. Utilizing ceramic and survey data collected in the spring of 2017 from the region surrounding the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Bat and nearby remains at ‘Amlah, this paper works to shift the focus of research on ancient Oman inwards by examining connections between settlements in the Bat region. An analysis of the ceramics collected in this area suggests a temporally dynamic landscape, with shifting centers of activity. Taking a localized, historically-particular approach to the archaeology of interactions in this small area ultimately reveals the significance of even the smallest known settlements in ancient Oman.

The technologies used to manufacture goods were themselves meaningful, often considered to be divinely inspired and certainly a key element in determining the value and significance of both everyday and esoteric objects.  As transformative processes, the methods and techniques of craft manufacture reflected the power of artisans to create and animate the material and social worlds.  Importantly, within media distinct technologies were often associated with different genders, classes, ethnicities, and other aspects of social identity.  Set within the context of the rise and fall of regional state-organized polities and waves of “contact” and conquest by more distant powers, I discuss how technological stability in some media reflected the persistence of autochthonic identities, “traditional” social structures, and indigenous claims to place, while the episodic introduction of new technologies – some developed locally and some “imported” by more distant conquerors – reflected the assertion of new loci of authority, the restructuring of sociopolitical relationships, and claims to different modes of prestige.",2966,Symposium,Presenter,2966,Cathy,Costin

Her critical re-evaluation of early cities, states, and complex societies incorporated past people and groups previously omitted from investigation, bringing to the forefront the political and economic dimensions of households and other social entities. Her work also drove the archaeology of identity and gender, correcting traditional approaches that too often left humanity out of explanations of the past. She has also established a landscape approach that examines the social relations that connected the city of Harappa to its many surrounding settlements, she has revealed rural/urban interactions that drove the emergence and transformation of urbanism. The impact of these contributions is ongoing, and has set the agenda for a new generation of comparative archaeology.

Previous scholarship has focused on the style and origin of these pins, generally associated with female adornment, but both the cuneiform and material records also allow for glimpses into the economic power they held for women during this period. For example, the Old Assyrian mercantile indicate that pins could function as working capital in times of need. Furthermore, the survival of their impressions on crescent-shaped loom weights across Anatolia also demonstrate their importance to the economic agency of women.

Despite their nearby geographic position, the trajectory of food production is distinct in these two regions. Nonetheless, both agrarian landscapes are impacted and developed by certain woody taxa. Using a niche construction framework, the concept of a “keystone species” is reinvisioned by utilizing archaeological, anthracological, and ethnographic datasets. These proxies enable us to investigate the social and ecological impact of the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) in southeastern Arabia and the fig tree (Ficus spp L.) in southwestern Arabia.

In homage to this work, we will present recent petrographic work by Dr. Greg Braun on Mature Harappan technological debris from Harappa, wasters from the firing of faience and/or steatite objects. As in Wright’s research, archaeological science methods show that simple refractory materials thought to be insulating, non-stick firing structures or containers for relatively simple objects, in fact seem to be remains of containers designed to transfer heat, used as ‘crucible’ containers for frits for the production of more complex fritted faiences, with bone fragments deliberately added as fluxes or perhaps even opacifiers.

These “borderland” studies led to insights concerning exchange, production, and the roles of elite managers and non-elite “labor”. Archaeologists and economists examined the material culture of dozens of sites to assess changing borderland partnership networks. This evidence revealed innovations in management and production strategies. Those innovations led rapidly to spectacular wealth, yet growing inequality, in a new economic system, while more conservative central lowland Maya states to the north were declining.

As in Wright’s approach, this material culture history of these “borderlands” provided a foundation for application of social and economic theory including Innovation Network theories and Network Failure theories from economics. This research is directed upward to examine the “big picture” of changing state economic structure and “downward” to identify the agents and forms of agency involved. This work confirms Wright’s conviction that borderlands production and its agents and material products provide keys to understanding ancient economic systems and the people that acted within them.

The Minnesota Historical Society employs a set of data standards that allows us to gather electronic cataloging data from a wide community of archaeology researchers depositing collections at MNHS. Though met with initial resistance, these standards have facilitated publication in Open Context as linked open data. Furthermore, institutional discussions concerning Creative Commons licensing and the cultural sensitivity of collections data were precipitated by publication.

Similarly, as Minnesota has prepared to roll out an electronic sites database, much of the development has dealt with defining standards for terminology and classification, highlighting the role of social agreement in data management.

Using recent fieldwork at the Greek colonial site of Histria in Romania as a case-study, this paper explores the space between high-quality 3D documentation used only by an internal audience and decontextualized 3D content designed for public consumption. In particular, we seek to determine whether high-quality, measurable 3D models derived from photogrammetrical capture are useful in communicating excavation results to other scholars – and if so, in what ways.

These and other cases span millennia and vast geography, and thus do not lend themselves to generalizations about the meaning or purpose of ash as a medium of ritual practice. However, in the broader cosmological framework of the Native Southeast, ash is a substance that was brought into existence through a transformation of matter that connected the Lower and Upper Worlds.

When clear evidence of intentional ash deposition is observed, it may be assumed that there was a significant meaning underlying the inclusion of ash in a special context or deposit.  Ash is commonly found below adobe caps in sealed floor hearths and termination pits of Jornada pueblo rooms as well as thin layers spread over abandoned and sealed floors. Ash is also associated with layers of burned roof material as part of ritual termination of architecture.  Intentional ash deposits have occasionally been found in pithouse floor hearths, and there is evidence of ash layers associated with deposits of ritual paraphernalia in certain caves.  Contexts where ash deposits are not present, such as burials and dedicatory deposits, are of further interest because they allow for a comparative contextual analysis.

The presentation, besides including a brief description of the artifacts, it is aimed at reconstructing the objects’ unknown contextual information through a comparison with similar objects held in American, Mexican and European museums, some of them proceeding from scientifically excavated caves. The comparative analysis, integrated by information deriving from Mixtec codices and early colonial Spanish historical sources, suggests that a group of caves in Puebla and Oaxaca contained similar sets of sacred bundles representing earthly beings known as ñuhu in Mixtec language. The bundles must have been used in ritual performances related with the reciprocal exchange of gifts between humans and extra human beings. The aim of the paper is thus to provide the artifacts in the NMAI collection with some of the contextual information that was lost when they were looted from the cave. In this way, the artifacts reacquire their status of powerful instantiations of earthly fertility, thus becoming much more meaningful both for Mesoamericanist scholars and contemporary indigenous communities.

The identifications were based on technical analysis and the use of site provenience information as well as design comparisons. The conclusions were subsequently confirmed by textiles in a grave lot from the Chancay valley excavated in 1904 by Max Uhle, kept in the Hearst Museum of Anthropology in Berkeley, whose ceramics show no Inca influence.

Drawing on current interdisciplinary research into its seventeenth-century Spanish mission, this paper considers challenges of extracting new interpretations from older collections. Research revisiting underutilized collections proffers opportunity for new questions, expanding insight, and refining disciplinary history. In particular, Hawikku’s mission remains and primary sources indicate its residence was a working and living space for Native laborers alongside Spanish Franciscans, comprising an everyday arena of cultural negotiation. Revisiting overlooked collections also furnishes occasion for collaboration with source communities, often excluded from the original research. Multi-level engagement with Zuni Pueblo informs this research project, increasing its relevance to community concerns, and enriching Smithsonian collections data for future use.

Almost all extant polychromed wooden qeros attributed to the colonial period derive from museum and private collections and lack provenience and precise means of dating. Here, we investigate the chronology and production of qeros by characterizing lead white pigment (lead hydroxycarbonate or lead carbonate, introduced to the Andes by the Spanish) used in the decoration of these vessels. We analyzed the Pb isotopic composition of lead white pigments taken from 21 colonial period qeros that currently reside in the collections of the National Museum of the American Indian-Smithsonian Insitution, the American Museum of Natural History, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and in private collections. The results indicate that, during the early colonial period Andean artists initially used lead white pigment manufactured from Spanish ores. In contrast, later period qeros were decorated with lead white pigment that was likely synthesized from local ore sources. Based on these results, we suggest the isotopic composition of lead white pigment may function as a chronological marker for colonial period qeros.

For over a decade communities have struggled to marshal these assemblages of cultural heritage to demonstrate their traditional ownership to acquire resource royalties. An imperfect and highly political process, claimants must overcome the legacies of out-migration, Christianity, and iconoclasm which have unevenly configured the distribution and knowledge of the past. In the midst of these processes, aspects of this diffuse heritage emerge unexpectedly: a WWII airplane rising up from the delta, stone tools unearthed by bulldozers, or rumours of ancestral beings encountered in the forest. In this paper I examine these periodic returns as a way to think through the region’s transforming ideologies, how the past is being marshalled by individuals and their communities to make a more hopeful future, and what role anthropology has in these processes.

Tribes, however, encounter several capacity-related challenges in developing tribally-specific heritage management plans. These challenges include the lack of funding for tribal historic preservation and repatriation, shortage of qualified staff, and, most significantly, operating within a heritage framework that was not designed with the needs or interests of tribes in mind. Given these significant challenges, how can an indigenous nation make archaeology work for and in accordance with tribal needs and values? Using the case study of Field Methods in Indigenous Archaeology, this paper evaluates how community-based research with the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Community of Oregon contributes to a uniquely Grand Ronde way for doing archaeology. Preliminary outcomes from FMIA suggest that indigenizing archaeology not only transforms our discipline’s relationship with and to indigenous communities, but builds our--archaeologists' and tribes'--collective capacity to care for and protect tribal heritage for future generations.

Accordingly, the Late Paracas period (370-200 BC) in the Palpa valleys (Andean Transect) serves as a case study for this archaeoeconomic approach.
The results show exchange processes in the western Andes that are characterized by unbalanced commodity flows. Resources from the highlands such as obsidian, camelids and their products – for instance wool – arrived at the Pacific desert strip in large amounts, while marine resources such as sea shells reached highland regions only in small amounts.

Incorporating both visual analyses of and compositional derived from LA-ICP-MS analyses of Tumilaca and Estuquiña pottery, I complement the long recognized stylistic distinctions by examining the transformation of productive practices and the organization of ceramic production as Moquegua underwent processes of population replacement and cultural change. Drawing in particular on material from Tumilaca la Chimba, a site with an Estuquiña occupation partially superimposing a Tumilaca occupation, I propose that the ceramic data suggest a more nuanced and complex picture of the transition from the terminal Middle Horizon to the LIP which, in tandem with new radiocarbon dates and excavation data, challenges the assumed temporal break between terminal Middle Horizon and LIP occupations in Moquegua and instead raises the possibility of a period of social interaction between communities.",2973,Symposium,Presenter,2973,Nicola,Sharratt

However, research on bead production among the Manteño-Guancavilca (AD 800-1532) of coastal Ecuador highlights the fundamental importance of this category of artifacts. By recording six measurements and four qualitative observations for each of 7651 beads from six sites (two regions, three stretches of time), this research has been able to recognize two distinct châines opératoires. At approximately AD 1200, bead makers shifted from a highly regular production sequence resulting in standardized chaquira (tiny beads) made from the ritually and economically significant shellfish, Spondylus, to one that is more opportunistic and results in irregular beads rarely made from Spondylus. This “destandardization” is associated with external economic forces, but also highlights the significance of the bead maker community of practice. Bead making endured the near complete loss of a market for chaquira, by becoming more flexible in their production strategy. That is, they tweaked their technological style to fit a new situation. In this way, bead makers retained their identity, as is demonstrated in the inclusion of raw material, production debris and tools in burials.

The initial industry (LCA type) is characterized by a stylistic homogeneity coupled with a wide geographical distribution. Compositional analyses, however, have shown a significant regularity in pastes, suggesting the use of localized sources of raw materials and/or specific production centers—indicative of a well-defined recipe and style. Provenance studies have identified a locus of production in the Guatacondo valley, in the hyper-arid core of the Atacama. In this valley the production and consumption of LCA pottery coincides with the emergence of mud architecture. Both technologies were developed in a geomorphological environment characterized by multiple outcrops of clay, making this material easily accessible. 
Using archaeometric methods, we approach both traditions as technological practices that required specific technical gestures, bodily engagements, labor organization, and temporal rhythms, mobilizing a collective that was partially constituted as such through the repeated and enduring transformation of mud. Considering the networks of materials, practices, and spheres of circulation wrought by these technologies, we offer an interpretation of the Formative process that centers on the qualities of clay in order to understand the material trajectories of this social landscape.

There is no serious scientific debate on whether humans have impacted the global ecology, but regardless of the ICS decision to anchor the so-called “Golden Spike” to the advent of the nuclear age, humans are known to have profoundly altered landscapes at deep timescales. Three examples are presented from the African continent: the Middle Stone Age (Pleistocene) of northern Malawi, the Neolithic (early Holocene) of the Sahara and Iron Age (late Holocene) of northern Cameroon in which the concepts of boundaries and potential impacts of human activity are challenged. Human impacts on ecological systems are qualitatively analogous to other keystone species, but quantifiably larger based on our control of fire and other forms of coppicing as landscape management tools. Although coppicing may not meet the GSSP standard, its accumulated global effect on landscape species composition has altered earth's environmental matrix as significantly as nuclear weapons.",2974,Symposium,Presenter,2974,David,Wright

Using archaeological and environmental data from China between the late Neolithic (ca. 5000 years ago) and the Song Dynasty (ca. 1000 years ago) we explore how the Anthropocene can be conceived as a process that developed slowly over time and that was conditioned by changing human interactions with the environment that were an outgrowth of shifting social, political and even religious practices and behaviors.

Here, a general causal theory, sociocultural niche construction, is presented to explain long-term changes in Earth’s ecology driven by societal dynamics across human generational time through sociocultural evolution of subsistence regimes based on cooperative ecosystem engineering, social specialization, non-kin exchange and energy substitution. It is these unprecedented anthroecological change processes that have enabled both the long-term upscaling of human societies and their unprecedented transformation of Earth. Regime shifts in human sociocultural niche construction over thousands of years can explain the sustained transformative effects of human societies on the Earth system.

Thompson discovered a masonry shaft running down the center of the pyramid that gave access to a cave/cenote beneath the structure.  This was the first account of a cave with a pyramid built over it and Thompson suggested that the cave contained seven chambers, hinting at the possibility of a Chicomoztoc. J. Eric Thompson in editing and publishing the report in 1938 notes that there are a number of discrepancies in this early account and over the years, archaeologists have grappled with the meaning of the discovery.  

The Gran Aquífero Maya project undertook a restudy of the pyramid, shaft, and cave.  The stone floor at the base of the shaft was found to be the top of a small platform that predated the construction of the pyramid.

The problem with truisms, statements so obviously true that they say nothing new or interesting, is that they direct attention elsewhere. This is probably why the Temple of Xtoloc was never placed on the Carnegie map of Chichen Itza even though Ann Axtell Morris excavated there in the 1920s.

Many of these subterranean features have been created naturally through geologic processes. However, it is significant that in areas devoid of natural subterranean features, pre-historic Native Americans constructed subterranean features to substitute for their natural counter parts. The archaeological and ethnographic literature document that ritual subterranean features are distributed throughout North America. Evidence includes ritually deposited cordage and sandals in the south and western portion of the United States, origin myths associated with Wind Cave in the Black Hills of South Dakota, and in New England where artificial subterranean features were created.

Due to its highly variable quality, Native American hunter-gatherers conducted extensive cobble testing prior to removal from the quarry area. They also mined pits and trenches to obtain the best quality material. A review of Yellowstone XRF-studies show use of Cougar Creek obsidian since the Paleoindian Period. There is a significant distance-decay reduction in its use, with local sites showing intense exploitation. In contrast, the material represents only ca. 1% of all XRF-sourced obsidian artifacts in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Thus, its significance lies in its use as a local source of stone, with little evidence of regional or national distribution such as occurs with the nearby Obsidian Cliff obsidian.",2976,Symposium,Presenter,2976,Douglas,MacDonald

Archaeological evidence indicates that these locations were utilized extensively by pre-contact Native American groups. The geological processes that shaped these landforms and produced outcropping lithic material also created ideal conditions for the growth plant food resources, particularly root crops. These root crops thrive on the lithosols containing outcropping toolstone and were extensively harvested by Plateau groups in the past. The Columbia Hills of south-central Washington State exemplifies this pattern. Myriad lithic extraction sites cover the ridgelines and slopes of the Columbia Hills, a landform that is also blanketed with important root crops. This paper examines the relationship between food resources, toolstone, and settlements in the Columbia Hills area. The distribution of Columbia Hills quarry sites and their spatial orientation in relation to subsistence resources and habitation locales in the surrounding area is indicative of the intensified use of the landscape for both food and lithic resource procurement. Comparisons to other areas within the Columbia Plateau suggest the presence of a regional pattern of intensive lithic procurement coinciding spatially with collector systems involving intensified plant resource gathering.",2976,Symposium,Presenter,2976,Ron,Adams

A mining area for tabular chert, approximately 10 hectares in size, was established at this locale in the course of a series of archaeological excavations, core soundings and a geophysical prospection. At Rein, tabular chert occurs in residual loams and mined in up to four meter deep shafts. According to this evidence, the site is only the second archaeologically traced Neolithic chert mine in present-day Austria.
The extracted raw chert plates suitable for chipped stone tool production were either worked on-site or shaped into bars, and subsequently transported into the settlements for further processing. Radiocarbon dates from charcoal samples derived from the prehistoric backfilling of the shafts indicate the Rein chert mine was in operation between 4500 and 3800 BC. 
Additionally, the raw material was petrographically and geochemically characterized, allowing for accurate provenance studies of artifacts from prehistoric sites produced from Rein chert.

Ochre is used worldwide for symbolic and functional purposes, and is often considered to be evidence for symbolic behavior by cognitively modern Paleolithic humans. Geochemical provenience analysis, complemented by ethnographic studies of ochre source exploitation, transport, and use, can elucidate whether culturally mediated source exploitation differs significantly from a least-cost energetics (closest source) model of source use. In 2015–2017 we sampled 53 ochre deposits in the Kenya Rift Valley, guided by Maasai, Samburu, and Dorobo informants. The strontium isotope ratio (87/86 Sr) and elemental composition of these sources were characterized using Electron Probe MicroAnalysis and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. Our results show that the Provenience Postulate is upheld at the regional scale by 87/86 Sr ratios and at the local scale by elemental composition, facilitating sourcing of cultural ochre.  Analysis of ochre recovered from the Elmenteitan Neolithic cremation burial site of Njoro River Cave shows that the pigment is derived from two sources 110 and 150 km to the south, despite the availability of high quality ochre at deposits 20-35 km away and nearby the main sources of obsidian artifacts found at this site.",2976,Symposium,Presenter,2976,Andrew,Zipkin

However, the fact that they are measured by different metrics and do not necessarily represent the same time period thwarted statistical integration of the results. Pollen and DNA pass through the digestive tract intermittently and over a longer period than macroscopically visible food remains. Furthermore, the pollen or DNA present may be derived from multiple meals. As such, it was determined that the datasets were best examined separately and integrated through qualitative interpretation of the aggregate results rather than direct statistical comparison of separate lines of data from individual samples or groups of samples.

New biomolecular methods are beginning to show promise in coprolite studies, and provide important additional information on human diet and health by analysing ‘invisible’ dietary clues. This session brings together an international group of researchers, covering a wide range of methodologies for the analysis of coprolites. The session aims to showcase current state of the art in coprolite research, and to establish best practice guidelines for the multi-proxy analysis of these remains. The goal of this discussion is to explore how this high-resolution information can be better integrated into broader analytical studies using more traditional forms of evidence.",2977,Symposium,Chair (Primary),2977,John,Blong

Previous research has argued, among other things, that turkeys were rare in the Canyon (Akins 1985); that turkeys first were a source of feathers for ritual and ceremonial activities, and only later treated as food (Akins 1985; Badenhorst et al. 2016; Windes 1977); that local wild turkeys were not present in Chaco Canyon and domestic turkeys were imported from the Four Corners region (Vivian et al. 2006); and that local domesticated and/or wild turkeys were husbanded within the canyon (Grimstead et al. 2016; Speller 2009; Speller et al. 2010). In this paper, we use turkey bone and turkey eggshell remains recovered during the 2013 re-excavation of Room 28 at Pueblo Bonito to address some of these controversies. Our results suggest that turkeys were likely husbanded at Pueblo Bonito (and possibly elsewhere at Chaco as well), and that site excavation histories may be biasing our interpretation of the turkey-human story at Chaco Canyon.",2978,Symposium,Presenter,2978,Emily Lena,Jones

Oxygen isotope ratios remain consistent between time periods and locations, which is inconsistent with the idea that oxygen isotopes can be used as an indicator of long-distance procurement of small mammal fauna in ancient Chaco Canyon. Carbon isotopes are enriched for archeological versus modern fauna suggesting a heavier C4 plant component to past lagomorphs’ diets. Room 28 lagomorphs are also significantly more enriched and more highly variable in their nitrogen isotope ratios than those from modern collections. This pattern of enriched carbon and nitrogen isotopes archeologically is not observed in rodents, suggesting that the lagomorph differences are not purely the result of ecological change.

Digital Data and Threatened Cultural Heritage,Worldwide,Other,Digital Archaeology,Cultural Heritage and Preservation,"In his influential book “To Save Everything, Click Here” (2014), Evgeny Morozov coined the term “solutionism” to describe a utopian vision that innovation in digital technologies can solve complex social problems. Fueled by Silicon Valley wealth, digital technologies have an obvious glamor. The high-profile reconstruction of the Palmyra Arch by the Institute for Digital Archaeology exemplifies how governments, universities, corporate sponsors, and granting foundations use media attention on threatened world heritage to showcase technological prowess. Do such efforts meaningfully preserve threatened heritage? Do they overshadow often tragic social realities that fuel war and other causes of heritage destruction? How likely are the data to be available, discoverable, and of any future use?

To move beyond solutionism, this paper highlights how digital data need better contextualization. Context is multi-dimensional-- simultaneously physical, social, and intellectual. Contextualization requires developing “human capital” through community archaeology and public education, and sustained institutional commitments for digital curation. Such efforts cannot be siloed institutionally, intellectually, or technologically. Open Context (http://opencontext.org) illustrates approaches to link and integrate heritage data across institutional and community boundaries in ways that can encourage continued development of the human capital needed to make digital cultural heritage a meaningful aspect of preservation.

Another set of deposits were revealed in and around Structure A-14 and A-16 of the East Court, Group A, the likely palace complex of Wat’ul K’atel and his successors during the Terminal Classic period. These deposits were most likely made around AD 900 when the Ceibal dynasty collapsed. These examples show certain variability in types and contents of deposits, but they are all tied to the ritual destruction of royal buildings at the time of dynastic disruption or collapse.",2980,Electronic Symposium,Presenter,2980,Takeshi,Inomata

Excavations in the courtyard in front of Structure B-6 at Xunantunich, Belize, exposed a dense deposit of artifacts. Through detailed analysis and recovery of the artifacts and ecofacts and an emphasis on both recording and analyzing the microstratigraphy, we argue that this deposit was de facto refuse left by people who occupied the group after a period of abandonment.

We advocate the use of a behavioral-contextual method for studying on-floor assemblages for ascribing them to one of several categories of abandonment. This behavioral-contextual approach examines the vertical and horizontal architectural contexts of artifacts, the relative completeness of vessels, and the represented vessel forms in order to better understand on-floor assemblages. This method accounts for mundane and ceremonial abandonments of gradual and catastrophic nature, along with abandonment with anticipated return. The proposed method is framed in a visual model built on archaeological case-studies from across the Maya world. Most of the featured examples correspond to residential architecture, but this model should be applicable to other types of buildings.

Remains of a large deposit of Terminal Classic materials were recovered from a corner of the palace’s primary courtyard. Based on its location on the courtyard surface and below collapse, the deposit was assumed to date to the period of the palace’s abandonment. The placement of this deposit was contemporary with Actuncan’s 9th-century renaissance as a post-royal capital after centuries of incorporation into polities ruled by kings located at nearby Classic period centers. Mixter and colleagues have argued that Actuncan’s palace served as a noble’s residence during the Classic period and was terminated during the Terminal Classic because of its symbolic association with external forces that had previously dominated the site. Drawing on new ceramic analysis, this paper looks in detail at the contents and context of the deposit to reassess the significance of the abandoned palace to Actuncan’s thriving Terminal Classic community.

The deposits date to the period of the depopulation and abandonment of the community and are interpreted as terminal deconsecratory acts by the community’s final residents. Most terminal deposits were placed on final structure floors and covered by collapse debris that accumulated through time. One unique terminal deposit, on the final structure floors of a diviner’s room, was carefully buried in a lens of fine sascab suggesting that special care and attention was taken to “bury” the terminal deposits in this room.

While some have argued for dietary continuity throughout the regional Woodland, others maintain that certain specific resources—including fish, wild starchy plants, and/or maize—were more intensively exploited over time.  The Cloudman site (20CH6), located on an island off Michigan’s Upper Peninsula in Lake Huron, is a multicomponent occupation spanning the Middle through late Late Woodland periods. The ceramic assemblage is therefore ideal for assessing dietary and technological change through time. Functional pottery analysis (of technical properties and use-alterations traces), stylistic pottery analysis, microbotanical analysis, absorbed lipid residue analysis, stable isotope analysis, and AMS dating are used in tandem to construct a chronological sequence of diet, cooking habits, and cooking technology and the relationships between them.

While such hunches are occasionally crafted into hypotheses, they are more commonly shared and discussed among practitioners without finding their way into the official project record.  The experiential knowledge obtained through archaeological survey is the result of accumulated observations of archaeological and geographic phenomena as well as interactions with the environment.

There is much diversity in tool use: hide working, butchery (meat/fish), impact, antler/bone working, wood working, and plant working. Various patterns were detected between tool use and tool technology. Many of the numerous microliths, showed impact damage, but are attributed to fishing rather than hunting. This conforms to the riverside location of the site on the River Eden. Hide working was primarily limited to dry hide, which supports the hypothesis that hunting was not the primary procurement activity and is also suggestive of a residential site, which is further supported by the diverse set of tools and wide range of activities represented.

Blades, blade-like flakes, and two blade core fragments are among the lithics recovered from these contexts. Because these transitional-looking assemblages were recovered from early Holocene contexts, we believe they potentially represent groups of early Archaic peoples who were separated from other groups that also practiced blade technology, possibly before they reached the UCP. The transitional nature of the assemblages suggests that blade technology gradually went away as people became increasingly familiar with the local environment, and therefore raw material sources. We further believe that these were family foraging groups that were seasonally occupying these shelters. Thus far, lithic technological analyses reveal that older or more experienced members of the groups were teaching less experienced people stone tool production.

There is disagreement as to whether one or as many as three hunting events are represented in Bonebed 2, and as to whether or not they truly represent bison jumps. This paper reports the results of renewed field investigations into the timing, context, and cultural associations of both bone beds at Bonfire Shelter carried out by the Ancient Southwest Texas Project at Texas State University. The paper then considers the interpretation of these archaeofaunal deposits as bison jumps, and the implications of those interpretations for Late Pleistocene hunter-gatherer social organization in the Lower Pecos and the larger Southern Plains region.",2984,Symposium,Presenter,2984,David,Kilby

Formalized bifacial projectile points are certainly the residues of systems of social interaction, and therefore have the potential to tell us something about social networks. The idea that relationships between artifact variability and social networks are simple, however, can be challenged on both theoretical and empirical grounds: complex systems science and ethnographic data strongly suggest that patterns of person-level interaction do not directly correspond to patterns of material culture visible at archaeological scales. A model-based approach can be used to better understand how changes in human-level behaviors “map up” to changes in both the system-level characteristics of social networks and the patterns of artifact variable that we can describe using archaeological data. Such an approach will allow us to more confidently interpret changes in patterns of artifact variability in terms of changes in the characteristics and spatial continuity/discontinuity of social networks during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition in the Eastern Woodlands.",2984,Symposium,Presenter,2984,Andrew,White

In spite of frequent use when modeling mobility and settlement, the material, spatial, and social characteristics of aggregation sites remain poorly understood. Here, we provide two examples of aggregation sites related to the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene Paiján complex of northern Perú. These early foragers occupied an ecotonal boundary zone along the western Andean foothills, which afforded access to the nearby Pacific coastal plain and adjacent highlands. Paiján settlement organization has been characterized as primarily logistical, with small task- or resource-specific locations and basecamps located in proximity to resource-rich zones. Two large sites (Je-431 and Je-790) in the Río Seco de Chamán drainage provide evidence for and insights regarding the aggregation process, as well as Paiján social organization.

Previous excavations identified three bone deposits. Bone Bed 1, the oldest deposit, yielded a single uncalibrated radiocarbon date of 12,460 +/- 490 BP. Investigators in the 1960s and 1980s argued that the patterned distribution of megafaunal elements associated with large limestone cobbles in Bone Bed 1 suggests human subsistence activity. However, no formal artifacts were recovered. Mounting evidence for earlier than Clovis occupations elsewhere in Texas, combined with advances in dating technology and spatial analysis, catalyzed new research into Bonfire Shelter’s deepest deposits. In the summer of 2017, Texas State University archaeologists excavated a 3x1m2 trench into intact Bone Bed 1 deposits. A three-tiered approach was implemented to identify evidence of human activity: targeted sampling for microdebitage in association with Pleistocene megafauna, a Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry based spatial analysis of faunal remains, and a column sample addressing the depositional environment of the shelter over 12,000 radiocarbon years ago.

This paper provides an evaluation of the natural and cultural formation processes associated with Paleoindian occupation in the Tennessee River Valley. Natural process emphasize dynamic environmental conditions, coupled with resource availability, primarily including changes in riverine drainage dictating Paleoindian site location. The cultural processes involved in site formation have often been juxtaposed as aggregations of small bands of highly mobile hunter-gatherers vs. re-occupation by single bands of hunter-gatherers.

This view is certainly shaped by many well-known single component bison kills which form the basis for the argument. The Lindenmeier (5LR13) Folsom site of northern Colorado might be a notable exception to the high mobility model, as it contains hundreds of Folsom tools, animal bone, chipping debris, and decorated artifacts spread over 800 meters of buried deposits. Approximately 9 to 12 dense artifact concentrations are documented across the site, and questions remain as to what these clusters represent – discrete living floors, middens, or palimpsests?

The earliest sedentary, ceramic-using villages occurred in clusters, but the clusters themselves were widely dispersed. They appeared in a variety of environmental settings, and they were surrounded by lands that were either empty or still inhabited by low-visibility/low-density populations. Given such patterns, it is far from obvious what factors would explain the simultaneity of the transition from Archaic to Formative. The goal of this paper is to assess the promise of one idea: that the transition to sedentism and pottery use was at least in part the product of intensified long-distance interaction and exchange in the later Archaic. The research involves assembling evidence on the presence, frequency, and source of artifacts of non-local origin at Archaic and Early Formative sites (obsidian is a significant but not exclusive focus of attention). Assemblages will be assigned as appropriate to four periods: Early-Middle Archaic (prior to 3500 BC), Late Archaic (3500-1900 BC), Initial Early Formative (1900-1400 BC), and Late Early Formative (1400-1000 BC).

Debitage of different varieties of chert is ubiquituous, as is heat-spalled rock of different lithologies. Several observations suggest that the site was repeatedly occupied by large groups of people performing multiple activities.

Obsidian is one of the few materials that can provide evidence for long-distance exchange through geochemical analysis, although relatively few sourcing studies have been carried out on Preceramic obsidian. In this paper, we report recent pXRF results from obsidian recovered at two Preceramic sites: Las Estacas, an Early Archaic period site in the Yautepec Valley of Morelos, and Yuzanu 36, a Late Archaic site from the Nochixtlán Valley, Oaxaca. Our results show that in each case a single obsidian source predominates, with at least 94% of the Las Estacas sample (n=100) from Otumba and 100% of the Yuzanu 36 sample (n=31) sourced to Guadalupe Victoria. We compare the results from Las Estacas and Yuzanu 36 to Preceramic and Early Formative period obsidian sourcing data from elsewhere in Mesoamerica. Data for the Preceramic and initial Early Formative indicate that in most cases obsidian procurement was focused on a small number of sources with procurement diversifying by the later Early Formative. We discuss the implications of the evidence for means and patterns of obsidian exchange.

Excavations exposed 15m2 of an occupation surface buried 13.5m below modern ground surface. An excavated assemblage consisting almost exclusively of biface reduction debris made of materials that crop out further upstream indicates that this was a short-term occupation with retooling as a primary activity.

Yet, more studies generate even more studies, and the demand is clearly rising for more samples made available. This is especially the case for those collections, which are very unique in terms of geography (Greenland) or time period (Danish mesolithic). At the same time, these unique collections also represent a limited resource; it is doubtful how many more Greenlandic or Danish Mesolithic skeletons will be found in the future. 

Aside serval major studies on Danish prehistory, we have also undertaken exploratory “proof-on-concept and feasibility” studies, and methodological studies, comparing different sampling techniques. The presentation will focus on sampling techniques over the last twenty years, describe the rising curatorial awareness of the implications of sampling, including ethical considerations, as well as the results of our methodological studies.

Rapid advances in technology have lowered barriers to biomolecular information by increasing the speed, affordability, and effectiveness with which researchers can extract and analyze biomolecules from ancient materials. Amid growing attention on museum collections as a source of samples for biomolecular research, the people who curate and manage these collections are faced with new challenges and considerations. Although destructive sampling is often necessary for the best available techniques, critical questions remain about how to balance the gain of scientific knowledge against the loss of materials for future study. 

This paper addresses major issues in biomolecular research and destructive sampling within the context of the physical anthropology collections at the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) of the Smithsonian Institution. External and internal processes for destructive sampling requests are reviewed, and appropriate conditions and expectations for approved proposals are discussed. Ultimately this paper aims to facilitate ethical and excellent biomolecular research on archaeological remains at NMNH, which has a responsibility to preserve and provide access to its collections in the service of science and for the public, as well as an institutional mandate to increase and diffuse knowledge.",2986,Symposium,Presenter,2986,Sabrina,Sholts

These range from blood samples, to hair bundles, single bones, complete skeletons, mummies, and decorated skulls, and are widely used for scientific research. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, anthropological and biological research gave us a greater understanding of human diversity, much of it based on anatomical evidence. Cambridge was at the forefront of this endeavour, and the result was the Duckworth Collection and Laboratory.
Following best practice guidelines in the document Guidance for the Care of Human Remains in Museums by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in October 2005, the Duckworth Laboratory created its own Policy for the Curation and Conservation of Human Remains. However, the past few years has seen a surge in biomolecular analysis of archaeological remains including human bone, teeth, tissue, hair, and dental plaque; innovative projects that require destructive analysis. A new position of Collections Manager for the Duckworth was created to facilitate this research whilst maintaining the integrity of the Collections.

",Historic,Ancient DNA,Cultural Heritage and Preservation,"Bengal cotton muslin, a particularly fine type of woven cotton fabric, had legendary status where it was traditionally produced in East Bengal—now Bangladesh—for at least 2000 years. During the colonial influence of the British Empire, muslin was widely traded outside of South Asia, and became a valuable global commodity with major impacts on both local producers and foreign markets. Political turmoil and market forces, especially pressure from the East Indian Company, completely halted muslin manufacture in the early 20th century. As a result, “Phuti Karpas”—the variety of cotton required for its production owing to particular fiber characteristics, botanically Gossypium arboreum var. neglecta—was entirely lost. An extensive search was undertaken to locate any living example of neglecta in crop fields or in the wild, and a candidate wild population was identified. With only 100-250 year old herbarium specimens available for comparative materials, we use whole genome sequencing of modern and herbarium specimens to suggest that a wild-type Phuti Karpas has indeed been rediscovered.

",Iron Age,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis: Metallurgical Analysis,Material Culture and Technology,"In the study of technological transformations, there is often much discussion of how innovations are conditioned by earlier systems of technical knowledge. Identification of transitional features is often challenging, however, particularly for questions about the origins of iron smelting and its relationship with copper-base metallurgy. This paper discusses some unusual technological features in iron metallurgical debris (circa 8th-6th c. BC) from a fortified hilltop site in the Caucasus, shedding light on the early development of iron technology. Macroscopically and microscopically, the slags are in most respects classic iron smithing slags. Larger fragments show the classic planoconvex shape of smithing hearth bottoms, and the slag microsctructures are dominated by wüstite (FeO) and small particles of metallic iron. However, analysis of metal inclusions trapped within these slags shows that they contain small amounts of copper and arsenic. These results suggest that the iron forged in this workshop was smelted from the oxidized upper zone (gossan) of a copper-bearing polymetallic deposit. If so, this would provide the first direct evidence of a much-discussed theory that iron smelting emerged from experimentation with copper ore deposits, linking the invention of iron with earlier copper-base metallurgical traditions.",2987,Symposium,Presenter,2987,Nathaniel,Erb-Satullo

Until recently in human history, the development of new technologies and materials depended on people attaining and controlling greater and greater temperatures. This process began more than one million years ago as the emergence and spread of our species depended on fire for warmth, cooking, and protection. Later we used fire to treat stone and wood implements and to create adhesives to join them together as compound tools. Baked clay eventually followed, as did ceramics, metals, faience, glass, and other substances upon which civilization was built. Additionally, fire is cross-culturally used ceremonially, and it is ascribed a variety of symbolic meanings. This session, organized by the Yale Initiative for the Study of Ancient Pyrotechnology, considers how our increasingly sophisticated control of fire, as evidenced in the archaeological record and in material culture, sparked behavioral, cultural, and societal complexity around the world.",2987,Symposium,Chair (Primary),2987,Ellery,Frahm

As part of this effort archaeologists have increasingly focused their attention towards rock art as a symbolic means to referencing a maritime identity. At one level, identifying this connection can be relatively straightforward via marine-themed imagery (e.g. watercraft, marine animals) but what else can we draw upon to understand the nature and depth of this relationship? In this paper, we turn to the ethnographic record as a lens to explore how specific motifs and sites from two locations in northern Australia (western Arnhem Land’s Wellington Range, and the Sir Edward Pellew Islands in the southwest Gulf of Carpentaria) are embedded in complex social and cultural networks for Australia’s ‘saltwater people’. At the core of our argument is the need to recognize how aspects of the ethnographic record such as song, kinship, cosmology and memory can play a pivotal role in accessing the meaning and symbolism of ‘saltwater’ rock art as well as how these images encode or communicate information about people’s social identities.

Lately, many have agreed that this is too simplistic a view and now see water as a binding force that allows for communities to connect across channels separating continents from islands or islands from their neighbors. In fact, the sea itself is a container for interactions between seafarers, who likely ate, slept, and communicated details of their journey to one another. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to trace the exact routes used by past navigators. Using least cost pathway analysis, I applied an isochrone method to analyze water-based travel corridors as canoe routes through the Caribbean to suggest possible route trajectories between sites connected through the movement of materials. Alongside evidence from experimental canoe voyages that speak to the physical relationship between voyager and voyage, these routes can place seafaring on the map.

With its large-scale ports and massive warehouses, the Roman empire easily fits this bill. Models of socio-political evolution, however, not only build on top-down templates of power, but also adopt a view of things (i.e. stored goods) as passive resources. But in the light of recent material culture theory, storage becomes a more complex mediation of time and matter than the ‘surplus model’ could fathom, with power emerging from localized mediations of assemblages of humans and things, although with historical implications that were no less far-reaching. 

This paper empirically traces the temporal and material choreographies of storage practices at Ostia and Portus, the main ports of the city of Rome. It investigates how things’ trajectories through these ports and their warehouses articulated control and calculability, and it traces the resulting landscape of power. In so doing, it challenges old readings of an opposition between state control and private interests at these centres, and instead proposes a kaleidoscopic model of power, rooted in the material and metaphorical assemblage of the family.",2992,Symposium,Presenter,2992,Astrid,Van Oyen

Thus there can be no states or rulers without monuments, elite regalia, official iconographies and the like—although traditionally it is only the human component that has been seen as the active element in this equation. More recently, archaeologists have sought to reconsider humans not as the users of things, but as their partners and co-participants in the social. In this paper I draw on such approaches to rethink anarchism as a particular mode of human-thing relations, rather than as an ideological stance or political philosophy. As a case study, I will examine a set of village communities of the Andean Late Intermediate Period (c.1000-1450) who resided on the heavily forested eastern piedmont to the northwest of Cuzco. Drawing on two seasons of excavation data, I will show how these settlements were founded by people who were attempting to flee the Inka Empire and all it represented. The rise of the Inka Empire entailed complex new forms of human-thing relations, and for the ancient anarchists presented in this paper, not becoming Inka was a process of actively rejecting those relationships.",2992,Symposium,Presenter,2992,Darryl,Wilkinson

In this it differed little from the early empires that have long held archaeology’s attention. But unlike its precursors, the U.S.S.R. was guided by a political ideology premised vigorously on the relationship between humans and things—between labor, the non-human inputs of production, and property. Imperial sovereignty rested on profound material dependencies that stitched the multiethnic “federation” together, while the individual Soviet subject was forged out of the proverbial hammer and sickle. As with all empires, the promised utopia never arrived, and the Marxist-Leninist “mattering” of politics came at a terrible human and environmental cost. The doom of this bold endeavor is palpable today in the physical ruins of Soviet socialism, which haunt the archaeological record of the contemporary past across Eurasia. Based on preliminary survey, ethnography, and archival research, this paper represents a foray into Soviet materiality and its afterlife, taking as its touchstone the former Soviet republic of Armenia and the industrial ruins that litter its urban and rural landscapes.

One tenet of French colonial policy was to govern through the operation of commerce, specifically through the infrastructure of cash-cropping. If peanut agriculture would, in principle, create both wealth for the colony and ‘African subjects,’ on the ground, peanuts combined with a web of material entities that bent, diverted, or interrupted the flow of imperial power: traditions of community-making; collective attachments to land, self-sufficiency, and ancestral influence; and cultural economies of objects, all of which had long shapeshifted to the beat of broader historical forces. These mixtures of imperial and vernacular materialities -- and the fields of agency they set in motion – find expression in the artifact assemblages of village vestiges occupied between 1800 and 1960. Tracing shifts in consumption practices during that period, I reflect on the fraught, ambiguous process of colonial rule, whose effects were chronically interrupted, twisted, or evaded by Siin villagers; at the same time, colonial commerce also gradually wove peasants into a web of dependencies – on markets and the state, primarily – whose strains are still felt in rural Senegal today.",2992,Symposium,Presenter,2992,Francois,Richard

Two answers to this question have received much attention: that empires promote ideologies that support cohesion among colonizers, and that coercion and violence can promote the expansion of empires. I propose a third answer, in which colonizers create varied material forms that may challenge the goals of empire, but later appeal to the king for regulation and control over the material world. To study this proposition, I use the example of coins among Spanish colonizers in Mexico City. Colonizers invented and used a variety of coins, in part by diluting gold into different alloys to make up for the scarcity of gold that they found in the colonies. Thus, they challenged imperial authority by creating new ways of measuring value and wealth (in this case, by creating more wealth with diluted gold). But when they found that their new coins created problems of conversion and exchange, they appealed to the crown requesting regulations over the minting, value, and use of different coins, thereby strengthening imperial authority.",2992,Symposium,Presenter,2992,Enrique,Rodriguez

Fancy Tiahuanaco-style pottery, used in life, during the burial ceremony, and accompanying the deceased in their tombs, helped to underline or maybe even create ties with the larger Tiahuanaco polity.

",Other,Ethnohistory/History,Colonialism,"Water plays an undeniable role in the constitution of politics and society, presenting an elemental force to be controlled for the expansion of agrarian economies. The political life line linked with water is perhaps nowhere better illustrated than with the Han Empire whose massive canalization and irrigation works were necessary to facilitate state expansion into deserts and tropics. The archaeological focus on water and agrarian infrastructure has however overlooked other capacities of water, for instance, as a potable substance in the production of life. Because an anthropocentric viewpoint begins with water as a matter of control, water appears as an object existing independently of the wider physical phenomenon. However, if archaeologists are to approach imperial projects as involving new ways of perceiving difference, this paper argues that water presents a contentious form at the intersection of frontier ecologies. Shifting away from infrastructures of water, this paper explores how water forms distinctive assemblages in colonial households beginning with the building of drinking wells in a newly established frontier.

Legacies of earlier generations of anthropological scholarship encourage researchers to assume particular traits of sociopolitical organization. Archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence from the Cuzco region of Peru demonstrates how such assumptions can be an obstacle to developing accurate representations of social organization.  As Inca elites extended power in the Cuzco region (AD 1200-1400), they interacted with diverse societies that did not all resemble the monolithic Andean ayllu. One compelling case for reconsidering ayllu organization is Yunkaray, seat of the powerful Ayarmaca polity, located near Maras, 35 km northwest of Cuzco.

This paper uses ethnohistory, regional settlement patterns, and excavation results from Yunkaray to note divergences from classic ayllu attributes. We identify camelid herding as a potentially integrative force in pre-Inca community formation, and examine the public performance of community identity in relation to Yunkaray’s neighboring polities.

I draw on the archaeological record of the Titicaca Basin for a preliminary exploration of this question. The production regimes used by Titicaca Basin peoples changed markedly over time, shifting from intensified agriculture in the Middle Horizon to relatively risk-averse strategies of pastoralism and rain-fed terrace cultivation in the LIP. But notwithstanding many basic cultural similarities among LIP Titicaca Basin societies, there are significant contrasts across this large region in the opportunities the land affords for farming and herding and the relative importance of these activities in late pre-Columbian times.

In brief, the ayllu has long been used as shorthand for community in the Andes, yet the parameters of the term – spatially, diachronically and culturally – have often been disputed. Here, we address the scope and limitations of this term in regards to cultural development, as well as archaeological analysis in the highland regions of the central Andes.

In this session, we focus primarily, but not exclusively, on the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1000 – 1450), examining what constitutes the community across the Andean highlands. In particular, we examine the role played by herders and farmers in the creation of community, and how the social and economic organization of these activities may have impacted the formation of such communities. The Late Intermediate Period is also seen as a period in which there was an increasing economic specialization by farmers and herders. This session includes contributions from the Central Andes – were the term ayllu has been most employed – as well as from other regions, including Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina.

The capac ñan from Chachapoyas to Moyobamba was used for centuries before another road was built for driving traffic and latest with the  Marginal further on to Tarapoto. The capac ñan was used by the Incas in their conquest of Moyobamba and later to be used by the many Spanish campaigns in their search for Eldorado. This important highland/lowland route crossing the cordillera and continuing into the Ceja de Selva gave access to coveted resources from both sides but also facilitated war parties to attack the highlanders. During our investigations in recent years, we have located the ancient trail which was stone paved for long stretches and found documents in the archives showing the existence of hitherto unknown tribes that lived along the river systems up to the end of the 17th century.

Recent research, however, reveals significant environmental and cultural diversity and calls into question whether “Chachapoyas” can meaningfully be understood as a single region.  There is little evidence for any practices that both unified it internally while distinguishing it from others, and ongoing research at the site complex of Tambillo in comparison with other areas of Chachapoyas indicates that the most productive approach at this stage is to focus on characterizing social and cultural patterns at the local level.  Determining how, or whether, higher-order sociocultural units were constituted at the regional level requires greater bodies of data than those currently available.  In this situation, it is both analytically productive and potentially more accurate to understand all interactions as inter-regional, even among groups that were once considered to belong to the same “region.”  Similar geographical and environmental conditions found in many parts of the Eastern Andes suggest that it is important to more broadly evaluate the importance of scale and landscape in characterizing inter-group interactions, and to reconsider models developed from coastal and highland contexts.",2994,Symposium,Presenter,2994,Anna,Guengerich

The forests collectively represent a global biodiversity hotspot, with many unique species. Environmental gradients are abrupt, with dramatic changes in temperature regimes with altitude, but also with switches in humidity from dry to pluvial depending on exposure to prevailing winds. The steep environmental gradients create dispersal barriers to plants and animals, resulting in highly restricted distributions. Along the >3000 m altitudinal gradient, there are zones where cooling air can form persistent fogs, leading to cloud forests that have moisture-dependent species and low stature trees, which nevertheless provide important ecosystem services. The relatively cool temperatures and steep slopes at higher elevations often discourage human colonization, but some sites include archaeological sites, suggesting that current land use may not be prescriptive of the past. Nonexclusive factors may include past climate change, enclaves with drier microenvironments, transhumance, and use of multiple ecological zones.

Specifically, how do we best recreate meaningful “archaeological regions” within a mosaic of ecological zones and groups with poorly known culture histories? Presenting results from the Proyecto Arqueológico Wimba – 2016, this paper analyzes the chronological development of the Wimba site within the Ceja de Selva of eastern Amazonas, Peru. Based on stratigraphy, radiocarbon dates, material culture, and architecture, Wimba went through both periods of local development and periods of involvement in regional interaction networks in the Late Intermediate Period (1000-1450 CE). The site is located along strategic pathways between the highland Chacha and eastern lowlands, and it includes diverse structures and open spaces that hosted communal gatherings. Excavation results show a long-term occupation that includes at least three phases of architectural construction. Recovered materials indicate that intra-regional exchange networks were most prevalent until the final occupation, when the impact of highland groups was felt. This paper argues that communal gatherings functioned as centrifugal forces in interaction networks, and most importantly helped “emplace” a regional network that incorporated multiple nearby ecological regions.",2994,Symposium,Presenter,2994,Brian,McCray

Located beside a pre-Hispanic paved road, the rock shelter accommodated mobile foragers, cultivators, travelers, and llama caravans moving through networks connecting societies north, south, east, and west. Despite several chronological gaps, Manachaqui’s sequence extends from the Terminal Pleistocene through the Late Horizon. Diachronic analysis of Manachaqui’s assemblages revealed two major patterns of movement and cultural connections. Early interregional interaction connected societies in regions north and south. By ca. AD 200-400, interaction involving llama caravans pivoted west toward highland societies. This new east-west network overlay, but did not replace north-south interaction that persisted throughout the latter centuries of the sequence. To evaluate subsistence self-sufficiency, it is more useful to examine data from the settlement complexes clustered to the east around 2,800 m in the forested Montecristo valley. Evidence from Manachaqui attests to the presence and intensity of interaction crisscrossing the ceja de selva.

I argue that significant changes in sociopolitical complexity occur alongside shifts and intensification in interregional interaction.
 During the Pomahuaca phase (BC. 1200-800); ceremonial centers with platform architecture appear suddenly throughout the valley alongside the expansion of roads and long distant interaction networks. By the subsequent Ingatambo phase (800 - 550 B.C.), the number of ceremonial centers in the valley decreased despite the florescence of monumentality at the site of Ingatambo and the increase presence of foreign pottery and other exotic materials. This data suggests that the long term development of sociopolitical complexity within the Huancabamba Valley was strongly linked to its interregional relationships and that Ingatambo, as a result of its strategic location, would eventually grow into a major node for both inter-regional and intra-regional interaction.",2994,Symposium,Presenter,2994,Atsushi,Yamamoto

Late Integration Period groups such as the Caras, Yumbos, Quijos, and Pastos were intimately connected via political affiliation and economic exchange – relations that were built and sustained in highly varied environments.

Based on the broad patterning of material culture, these networks were seemingly oriented around the Marañón River and its major tributaries.

Largely understudied, scholars have typically regarded the region as either a barrier or conduit for highland-lowland interaction. However, recent investigations show that the ceja was not simply a transitional zone but rather a locus of complex cultural developments that occurred “in relation to” and “independent from” contemporary phenomena in adjacent coastal, highland, and tropical lowland environments. Similarities in material patterning from Ecuador to Bolivia suggest that autonomous ceja de selva societies were integrated within long distance intraregional interaction networks which potentially impacted local cultural change. These networks were oriented around rivers such as the Marañón and Huallaga which facilitated the movement of people, resources, and ideas. Unfortunately, understanding these relationships has often been hindered by models that emphasize highland or lowland developments, and either ignore the ceja, or treat it as a transitional environment exploited for resources.

Aeolian deposits accumulated in lowland areas and adjacent foothills at relatively high rates, soils were relatively underdeveloped, river down-cutting prevailed across the valley, and wild fires were common. These disturbance regimes and periods of landscape instability fostered a wide expanse of early- to mid-successional mixed vegetation communities that included herbaceous tundra, shrubs and deciduous trees, key habitats for large grazers and browsers that were significant resources for early hunter-gatherer populations.

Major environmental transitions occurred in the region as the Holocene climate warmed and effective moisture increased, including the spread of boreal forests and peat lands, an expansion of lake development, and intensified landscape stability. These transitions introduced changes to the extent of habitat and seasonal availability of mammal and aquatic food resources. We discuss broad human responses to these environmental shifts in this region from the late Pleistocene through the later Holocene.

For modern Paleoindian researchers, Finley still poses important questions and offers several potential avenues for research. The prior work with the Finley faunal remains, as well as our current investigations, demonstrate that the site is associated with an enormous collection of bison remains that are thought to have been killed on site or nearby. Our reexamination of the site combines a taphonomic-based zooarchaeological analysis of the bison remains from both components with additional field-based investigations of the geoarchaeological context of the bonebeds. This work is being undertaken in order to 1) improve our understanding of the natural and cultural formational histories of the deposits, 2) evaluate prior interpretations concerning site function and season of occupation, and 3) evaluate how the Finley site improves our understanding of regional Paleoindian chronostratigraphy and paleoenvironments.

Prior alluvial stratigraphy studies concluded that arroyo formation near these settlements occurred two centuries after this exodus and therefore was not a contributing factor. The present study used a larger sample of radiocarbon dates, including short-lived, charred plant material from alluvial contexts and tree-rings from several deeply buried juniper trees preserved at the base of paleoarroyo fills, to refine the dating of late prehistoric channel entrenchment in the Zuni Salt Lake area. Bayesian age modeling that included juniper germination dates determined by radiocarbon wiggle matching facilitated construction of a high-resolution alluvial chronology. The revised chronology includes an arroyo-cutting episode constrained to the 60-year interval between AD 1106 and 1166. This finding suggests that terminal Pueblo II depopulation of the Zuni Salt Lake area ~AD1130 probably did in fact coincide with extensive arroyo formation.

Such information can provide insight into the production and consumption of artifacts, but may also inform discussions about local political economies. Our study uses qualitative optical petrography and geochemical analysis (NAA) to evaluate the tempers and paste recipes in ceramic fragments and raw clays from Angamuco, located in the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin, Michoacán. Angamuco was occupied before and throughout the development of the Purépecha Empire (1350-1530 CE) and is thus an important case study for understanding the impacts of political change on urban landscapes. Angamuco appears to have been relatively self-sufficient in pottery production, beginning in the Classic and through the Postclassic, including during imperial incorporation. While we did identify some temporal and spatial variation in ceramic production and consumption, pottery technologies and techniques of manufacture appear to have remained relatively stable over long periods of time. Our data point to multiple small-scale producers, who focused on local clays and tempers, generating numerous, complex paste recipes. The results of this analysis contribute to our understanding of ceramic production processes at Angamuco and may be compared to provenance studies in Western Mexico and elsewhere.

During a systematic field survey carried out for my doctoral research as part of the European Research Council-funded Crossroads of Empires project led by Prof Anne Haour, StG 263747, over 300 new archaeological sites were discovered and 50,000 material culture objects recorded. This paper will discuss the methodology used to systematically survey the landscape of this region using field walking and satellite imagery and how the results were integrated within a GIS, creating the most archaeologically comprehensive map of the area ever made. The preliminary results of this research demonstrate that settlement favoured areas close to perennial and ephemeral fluvial systems. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the sites discovered displayed strong evidence of spatial clustering, which has been shown in other West African contexts to be indicative of early urbanisation – however this may also be evidence of the slow destruction and segmentation of mounded sites.",2998,Symposium,Presenter,2998,Nadia,Khalaf

",Other,Remote Sensing/Geophysics,Landscape Archaeology,"During the summer of 2016, preliminary geophysical prospection survey using ground penetrating radar (GPR) was conducted at the Neo-Punic and Roman period site of Zita, Tunisia.  Since the time available for the fieldwork was limited to two weeks, the survey focused on examining specific areas of the site to document certain architectural features, and in several locations where industrial activities were known to have occurred based on previous limited excavations.  Additionally, a region identified as a “tophet”, a sacred burial precinct for infants, was examined during the survey.  Goals for the GPR survey were different in each area examined, and the results will aid in future excavations and paleoecological reconstructions.
Results from all survey areas will be briefly mentioned, but the paper will emphasize two main target areas.  Two industrial sectors were surveyed, where iron metallurgy was practiced, and total slag volumes are estimated to assess the ecological legacy of the industry.  A second area of emphasis was the “tophet” burial precinct, for which the GPR survey produced unexpectedly clear results that enable analysis of the mortuary landscape.  Implications of all the results will be briefly discussed, and directions for future GPR survey and excavation will be presented.

I am consolidating previous survey data and expanding upon them using several methods of archaeological survey and remote sensing with the broader goal of tracing cultural patterns in the landscape using GIS. Specifically, my work has been testing the informed hypothesis that many sacred groves, hilltops, and low rises in the coastal hinterlands and forests of Ghana were the settlement sites of agricultural communities in the first and early second millennium A.D. To do this I used a combination of satellite imagery analysis, topographic information, and archaeological survey to predictively model and test where these sites will be located based on this hypothesis.

Surrounding these historic settlements are sacred groves with springs, caves, and boulders that give physical evidence in their Indigenous religion of the animation of the non-human world. Yet, the canopy of trees also harbored cemeteries, Orthodox Churches, and stacked stone walls, berms, and trenches that reveal a history of conflict. We use Geographic Information Systems software in conjunction with collected locational data, physiographic and land cover data, oral traditions, toponymical associations, historic maps, and other documents to build historic settlement and environmental models.

Two common approaches involve: 1) analyzing the relative sizes of sites to evaluate possible site size hierarchies, and 2) analyzing the spatial distribution of sites across landscapes to evaluate possible clustering or dispersion. This paper applies more statistically rigorous methods that commonly employed, namely Ripley’s K Multi-Distance Spatial Cluster Analysis to evaluate possible spatial clustering/dispersion, and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) analysis to evaluate possible site size categories/hierarchies. These methods are performed on archaeological site data from two distinct areas of the northern Ethiopian highlands collected by the Eastern Tigray Archaeological Project (ETAP) and Southern Red Sea Archaeological Histories (SRSAH) Project. Results show strikingly similar patterns in the two areas, including an increase in the number of sites and decrease in average site size over time, site clustering only during the Pre-Aksumite period, and a lack of site size hierarchies that are predicted by traditional models of state-level settlement patterns.",2998,Symposium,Presenter,2998,Joseph,Mazzariello

As land claims were made for household farms, hierarchy developed and some were pushed to settle on the margins.

Examining marginal and non-marginal sites through a zooarchaeological lens can help decipher patterns of resource use which can act as a proxy for understanding environmental and social change. Current work on Hegranes has shown that the archaeofaunal assemblages from marginal sites are nearly always comprised of over 50% wild resources throughout the site’s short occupational history, while those from proper farms are dominated by domesticates. These marginal sites also follow a pattern of abandonment by the year 1104 A.D., while many of the larger farms are still functioning to the present.

The settlement of the island two centuries earlier set off cascading environmental and landscape changes whose agricultural consequences were now evident, including deforestation, erosion, and wetland alteration. Meanwhile, the rise of a wealthy landowning class altered the economic basis of society from primarily household production towards more centralized structures of rent extraction and tenancy. On Hegranes, a region in Skagafjörður, North Iceland, numerous small settlements on the margins of modern farm properties were abandoned during the 11th century. These sites are in localized areas of deep, dry soils between eroded bedrock and wetland, and while some may represent independent households, others likely served specialized functions in the service of larger farmsteads. After the sites ceased to be inhabited, they were used sporadically for livestock management over the next eight centuries. This rapid reorganization of settlement patterns and landscape use reflects simultaneous and interconnected transformations in ecological and social practice. This paper explores how the changing practices of marginal households both contributed and responded to this moment of transformation, as environmental and political factors came together to alter the material ways in which social inequality was organized and maintained.",2999,Symposium,Presenter,2999,Kathryn,Catlin

While marginal highland areas were most seriously affected, resulting in farmstead abandonment, the nature of changes in lowland areas and their impact on the productivity of individual farms is poorly understood.

This newly untethered and mobile lower class searched for avenues for wealth creation previously unavailable. One avenue, in the century following Iceland’s Black Death, was through fishing and fish exports. During this period, previously tightly restricted fish exports flourished in trade between European merchants and numerous fishing and trading sites around Iceland’s coast. The 15th century fishing station of Gufuskálar on the northern coast of Iceland’s Snæfellsnes peninsula demonstrates large and anomalous concentrations of wealth and European trade goods. The site also has evidence of increasingly specialized marine resource utilization. Whether Gufuskálar’s resident fishermen were Icelandic or European, it is likely that this concentration of wealth was only possible through the temporary breakdown in Icelandic social hierarchy.

Most of the research on the Dissolution focuses on how the new landowners reused the land, or converted churches into manor houses. However, people who lacked the means and resources to make large-scale changes to the former monasteries still found a way to express their new relationship through removing and reusing the stone in the farms and villages near the monastery. At Thornton Abbey, multiple agricultural and village properties were surveyed for monastic stone. The stone was reused as building material, garden decorations, and, more recently, as gifts.

Although the community was home to two small rural municipal centers, it was distant from coastal trading points. Through interdisciplinary archaeology, environmental investigation, and documentary evidence, this paper investigates and describes how people in Mývatn managed ecological productivity and economic engagement at a periphery. We find that their significant efforts to secure abundance from marginal places was inseparable from social transformations through which the community ultimately assumed an influential role in changing the conditions of regional and national trade.

The initial coastal-focused settlement of the region was followed by the founding of new farms in the deep interior.  Most were not sustained and some farm sites on the coast were also reduced. Initially, the magnate’s farm of Svalbarð had a herding economy supplemented by fishing while Hjálmarsvík, its coastal neighbor, exploited a diversity of marine resources. Around AD 1300 Svalbarð became the chief consumer of the region’s marine resources and Hjálmarsvík become a more specialized sheep-herding farm resembling other small farms. While this switch occurred during a period in which wool production was on the increase in Iceland, it also corresponds to a phase of climatic cooling. New geoarchaeological and remote sensing data provide a means of resolving the roles of these trends on the Svalbarð estate.

Finally, ideas will be presented on how to work with non-traditional partners, like emergency managers, to communicate the risk natural hazards and climate change pose to archeological sites and why it is important to “mitigate” those risks to sites.",3e3,Symposium,Presenter,3e3,Jennifer,Sparenberg

The survey identified 163 archaeological sites of which 33 were tested and partially excavated. Previous archaeological surveys of Block Island concluded that a high frequency, density, and complexity of Woodland (2700 – 400 years before present (B.P.) and Contact Period (400 – 350 B.P.) archaeological sites located on landforms immediately adjacent to the interior salt ponds with far fewer, and much less complex sites located on the bluffs along the seaward coastline.  Larger and more complex permanent and semi-permanent village sites were believed to be located almost exclusively along the salt ponds with smaller temporary and task specific sites associated with freshwater swamps and ponds throughout the interior and near coastal areas of the island. The identification of several large seaward Woodland and Contact Period coastal sites suggest a much more complex settlement pattern than previously believed. These sites are believed to represent spring fishing camps, indicating that earlier reconstructions of Native settlement patterns on Block Island need to be revised.

In the wake of this event, surveys to identify and characterize damaged coastal archaeological sites were conducted in several states.  This work seized a window of opportunity to access and observe sites along highly informative exposures, many of which have since progressively degraded and, in some instances, eroded completely. These surveys prompted the innovation, adaptation, and application of large-scale survey methodologies while collectively advancing understandings of the region's coastal archaeological record, addressing millennia of Native American occupation and centuries of post-Contact Period use. Hurricane Sandy compelled cultural resource management in this part of the world to begin a new chapter, one where archaeological sites threatened by rising sea levels and storms of increasing intensity and frequency present a fundamental priority. This symposium features presentations by several of the archaeologists and administrators involved with this work, who will discuss operational challenges, new perspectives of the past, and the future of coastal archaeology.

During the latter half of this period, the secondary site of Ucanha in Yucatán was physically integrated into a micropolity via an 18-km long sacbe and experienced the creation of integrative civic spaces, a population apogee, and an influx of ceramic heterogeneity. Unlike the more rigid and historically ingrained materialization of social differentiation seen in the Late Classic, the material components of distinction during this time were more fluid, in general, and more ambiguous during and after this process of larger regional integration. The presence of possible extrahousehold feasting at a relatively isolated, larger domestic platform, an elite residence covered in stucco with iconography indicating governance and/or economic distinction, and various ceramic forms and aesthetic embellishments highlight emerging new materialities of differentiation. With an apparent depopulation by the Early Classic, it is likely these new expressions favored social inequality over communal cohesion.",3002,Symposium,Presenter,3002,Barry,Kidder

Noted by John Stephens in 1841 as a large city with a deep water cave and gigantic pyramid, Xcoch is among a host of Puuc sites now dated to the Preclassic period. An interdisciplinary research program at Xcoch and vicinity from 2006 to 2013 revealed Preclassic Maya community patterns, megalithic architecture, and material culture for a developing complex society. Massive high building platforms, numerous stone pyramids and plazas, heavy stone habitation structures, and an internal site causeway connecting the large Gondola Aguada to the Xcoch grotto are among the many Preclassic settlement features extending across nearly 3 sq km. This paper examines Preclassic settlement patterns at Xcoch and its role as a regional center for the central Santa Elena plain and the greater Puuc region. Other Preclassic sites show mounting evidence for early megalithic architecture and formative ceramics  supporting the presence of a multi-tiered hierarchy within Xcoch's immediate settlement orbit. These data suggest that Xcoch was a stratified society at the center of a formative regional settlement hierarchy centuries before the apogee of the world heritage site of Uxmal.",3002,Symposium,Presenter,3002,Michael,Smyth

This type, classified as Yotholin Pattern-Burnished, has a medium-fine paste and unslipped surfaces that had been smoothed or burnished in decorative patterns. 
Since then, similar wares have been recovered from Preclassic contexts at a number of other sites. Although Brainerd originally described Yotholin as an Early Preclassic type, other archaeologists have attributed it to the late Middle Preclassic. In this paper, we will revisit the contextual evidence surrounding Yotholin and discuss it in light of our work in the Puuc and recent reevaluation of Middle Preclassic ceramics in general. This reanalysis suggests that Brainerd’s initial interpretation of Yotholin was correct and that it is contemporaneous with and/or slightly predates early Middle Preclassic Ek phase ceramics (900-700 BC). It is possible that Yotholin represents the earliest pottery yet identified in the Northern Lowlands. We examine the implications this would have for understanding the origins of the Maya in this region.

How can this power be release or lost? There are many ways in which a building can be imbued with certain attributes that allow expressing and regulating unequal power relations. Along with the form and style of buildings, ritual is perhaps one of the most important means. Through ritual performance, actors imbue the building with the ch'ulel, ensouling and animating it; obliged the ch'ulel to leave the building, killing the animate construction, and make it possible for the ch'ulel to reborn, favoring it to become more powerful. In the  lowlands, the performance of rituals that had as purpose to animate, kill or make reborn buildings is a long-standing tradition that dates back to the Middle Preclassic period. This paper focuses on Structure 1714-Asub of Xaman Susula, a public building interpreted as architecture of power, precursor of the Classic palaces that had administrative and ritual functions but lacked domestic functions of palaces. During the archaeological explorations, we found material remains of ritual behavior that indicates that Structure 1714-Asub was alive and powerful.

On the one hand, this data provides an outlet to better explore the large scale social processes impacting the early macro-region of the Maya area. However, material analysis of recovered shell, lithic, and ceramic artifacts assisted by stratigraphic context has revealed that many of the regional characteristics of later periods, such as shared religious practices, systems of material value, and networks of exchange were much more distinct at the local level than anticipated in the earliest investigated contexts. As a result, the data make it clear that as time progressed from 900 to 350 BC, while Yaxuná underwent urbanizing processes, the presence of material objects increased while the selection of those materials gradually became focused on more fixed sources. In the same way, the previously recognized diversity of material objects became increasingly limited. This paper will focus on the implications of the Yaxuná data for the development of systems of value and exchange in early Maya society.

For that reason it is an important area when trying to understand the unique characteristics of the Preclassic period in the Northern Lowlands. The Yalahau region is defined physiographically by freshwater wetlands (sabanas), which stand in stark contrast the rest of the Northern Lowlands. These wetlands were utilized by Preclassic inhabitants of the region for agricultural purposes and helped support a dense Preclassic population. The wetlands are framed to the north by the Yalahau Lagoon and Holbox Island. Research by Proyecto Costa Escondida members have revealed the dynamic nature of the coastline during the Preclassic period and there seems to be a correlation between the changing nature of the coastline with the utility of the inland freshwater wetlands for the region’s inhabitants.

Excavations along the center axes in the plaza of the Middle Preclassic village of Paso del Macho in the Puuc region of Yucatan have yielded a series of offerings spanning from the early Middle Preclassic to the cusp of the Late Preclassic. Three different floor sequences were each associated with several offerings. The forms of the nine pottery vessels recovered from the cache are quite unique compared to types normally encountered in Middle Preclassic contexts from the Puuc region. These include a bucket, miniature bowls and dishes, and cacao serving vessels. Several of these vessels contained large greenstone axes and basalt, while another contained a perforated greenstone plaque. Upon reaching sterile soil, a massive pile of basalt fragments was found, under which three large east-oriented greenstone axes were recovered. This greenstone cache bears strong resemblance to other Middle Preclassic place-making deposits from the Maya lowlands, including Ceibal, Cahal Pech, and Cival.

Yet archaeologists studying the Preclassic Maya of the Northern Lowlands have not only unearthed heretofore unknown sequences of cultural history, but have redefined the nature of social and political complexity for the Maya more broadly. Traditional archaeological methods such as survey and excavation have led to the identification of monumental acropoli, rural villages, and the construction of proto-urban spaces. These methods are increasingly being buttressed if not outright superseded by pioneering archaeological methods, including airborne LiDAR, chemical composition analyses, and sophisticated environmental studies. By exploring the adoption of new expressions of inequality, the effects of sedentary life, the construction of monumental spaces, and interaction with other Mesoamerican peoples, we seek to extend our knowledge of the Preclassic in this region beyond merely being a stepping-stone to the Classic period, and instead focus on its standing as a period of distinctive social and environmental adaptation.",3002,Symposium,Chair (Primary),3002,Evan,Parker

While much of what we know of this economic system is provided by written records, the presence of large-scale marketplaces and currency can be traced into earlier periods using archaeological evidence. This evidence suggests that, in the Maya lowlands, both of these features began in the 7th century, as the rival kingdoms of Tikal and Calakmul attempted to consolidate and centralize their regional economies. These economic strategies increased the demand for currency commodities, reconfiguring economic relationships far beyond these two kingdoms. This paper will address the archaeological evidence for rapid changes along the San Pedro River in Northwestern Guatemala, an important trade route for cacao importation. Focusing on the site of La Florida, it will discuss the rapid rise of this kingdom, its establishment of economic and political relationships with distant partners, and its strategic control of the San Pedro trade route.

The means of finance—whether by surplus production, saving, assuming debt, sharing costs, or other mechanisms—depends on the particulars of the economy in question and can have systemic and long-term consequences for adopters. To show why finance matters in explanations of technological change and how archaeologists can study it, this paper presents a case of household saltmaking in the Basin of Mexico during the Aztec and Spanish empires. Saltmakers adopted several innovations in the manufacture of vessels they used to evaporate brine, but differences in how they financed these changes had divergent effects on the social relations of production. One set of innovations that reduced ceramic vessel production costs during the Late Postclassic correlates with a period of independence and stability among saltmaking households. However, Colonial-era saltmakers became dependent on wealthier investors for access to the means of production, most likely because they lacked the financial means to adopt an innovation involving metal cauldrons.

While commonly referred to as ‘money’, these disks were not currency in the strict sense, though their value is not dissimilar to other traditional and modern objects where worth is arbitrary based on both real and perceived attributes (e.g., size, shape, quality, pedigree, or other factors). These characteristics have corollaries in today’s society for material culture and electronic cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology—essentially, digital ledgers that track financial transactions in real time across a computer network to ensure that they are seamless and incorruptible. Here I argue that transactions involving traditional forms of ‘money’ or exchange valuables are the precursor to Bitcoin and other technologies that demand a unified and continuous chain of information to ensure that the value is known and ownership indisputable.

Local and long-distance trade often functioned by market mechanisms. The economies had the capacity for real growth beyond Malthusian pace-keeping.
 Greece and Mesoamerica contrast in their current states of method and theory. Mesoamerica has better samples of city and hinterland settlement patterns. Ancient Greece has fuller textual sources. Research on the Greek economy is more in touch with economic theory.

The creation and use of a local coinage—silver from the 8th-10th centuries, and copper from the 11th century onward—is often viewed as a way that town leaders emulated features in the Islamic heartland thus linking towns to it. Although the copper coins of the Kilwa region clearly referenced and emulated coin systems in the Indian Ocean world, they were not, we argue, meant to connect Swahili towns to that broader world. This coinage, minted at Kilwa Kisiwani, was used only in a small region of the coast, and found at three towns (where they are plentiful in the archaeological record). We argue that the leaders of these towns created their local coinage as a medium of everyday exchange among the general populace, cognizant of the usage of coins more broadly within the Indian Ocean world, but as an effort to materialize power and authority locally.",3004,Symposium,Presenter,3004,Jeffrey,Fleisher

A noted shift in shell beads occurred about 800 years ago with the appearance of a new bead type, cupped beads, made from the thick callus of the Callianax biplicata, a portion of the shell that had previously not been used. These types of beads were common throughout the Chumash region and elsewhere during the Late period and have been identified as money beads on the basis of their distributions in cemeteries and other contexts. They are more widely distributed than other bead types, indicating that most individuals had access to them, although certain individuals were buried with hundreds or thousands of cupped beads while others had significantly fewer. Ethnographic and ethnohistoric accounts document that shell bead money was used for many types of transactions, including the purchase of subsistence items such as fish, acorns, seeds, and otter skins; most manufactured goods, including steatite ollas and digging stick weights; and some services, such as transporting people or goods in plank canoes between the islands and the mainland.",3004,Symposium,Presenter,3004,Lynn,Gamble

Though the contexts and nature of creditor-debtor relationships are variable and contested, evidence for debt is consistently present in documents related to large, corporate estates. But what does indebtedness look like beyond the hacienda on small-scale estates? In the absence of historical documents, or evidence of a company store, can debt be observed materially? This paper examines the role of debt in the relationship between landowners and laborers at Rancho Kiuic (ca. 1760-1950); a small, privately-owned cattle ranching estate in the Puuc Hills of Yucatán, Mexico. Owned and worked by generations of Maya speakers, narratives of indebtedness to the Rancho’s owners are woven throughout the oral history of the community.

The hidden archaeology of household debt and instability in medieval Iceland,Europe: Northern Europe,Historic,Survey,Political Economy,"Archaeologists generally assume that the absence of market exchange implies an absence of financial debt as a mechanism of exchange and social control found in more ""advanced"" economies. This implicit logic is reproduced in contexts where identifying market exchange largely relies on tracking the circulation of specialized and imported goods, as is the case in medieval Iceland: a society largely made up of subsistence tenant farmers where archaeological indicators of market exchange virtually disappear after the Viking Age settlement of the island. But David Graeber urges us to look deeper for sophisticated systems of value and material exchange in societies that have been traditionally considered to have primitive economies. His work also calls attention to the ways that debt, as a social and economic phenomenon, structures relationships and the juridical status of individuals. Reevaluating medieval Iceland with this lens, we see the disappearance of imported goods following the Viking Age not as evidence of a primitive subsistence economy but rather the development of an entrenched system of financial debt that had profound implications for the juridical and personal status of individuals as a failure to pay debts frequently resulted in the fracture of the family and household.",3004,Symposium,Presenter,3004,Douglas,Bolender

Although coins, mainly from the Greek colony of Massalia (modern Marseille) were already present before the conquest, their use appears to have been limited.  After the Roman conquest, the (at least partial) monetization of the local economy at Celtic settlements in Roman Mediterranean Gaul like Lattara significantly transformed notions of wealth and value, with a new interchangeability of wealth emerging.

Mules, horses or people pulled low and flat, four-wheeled wooden carts along these rails, which connected haciendas, ports, and remote jungle camps. These rails brought supplies from “civilization” or commodities out of the forest for distribution. This paper will explore the role that railroads played during this period. For the elites who ran commodity industries, Decauville rails were part of the modernizing infrastructure used to “tame” the jungle and speed up labor production. For the workers, the rails were laid atop stone roads built by their ancient ancestors, along jungle paths that their families had walked centuries, or through agricultural fields on lands formerly theirs. They were a tool used to exploit labor in a brutal process of forest and agricultural extraction for global commodity consumption, and a symbol of their loss of property rights, resources and the ability to feed their own families. And yet, in some cases, the rails that traversed into the forest allowed Maya workers to be away from the watchful eye of managers, hidden away in the untamable forest.

The roads provided a physical connection between portions of Ichmul, San Felipe, and Yo’okop, running between important structures, out to outlying groups, and even to what had likely been separate settlements. Although they would have been used for processions between termini and may have been had numerous symbolic meanings, the impact of some the roadways on the lives of commoners may have instead been that of impeding the flow of transit. An examination of the contexts, features, and physical forms of these roadways shows how, rather than necessarily easing transit in the manner of most modern roads, some sacbeob were set apart as sacred space no longer available for quotidian functions. In contrast, other causeways seemed to be designed to welcome public access, providing for the ready flow of foot traffic along and across their spans.

Some of these shared planning ideas reflect top-down design concepts related to specialized political and ritual functions for various buildings and features. Although plazas, buildings, and causeways may have had multiple functions, we use excavation data, comparisons to other sites, and depictions in Maya art to argue that the Late Classic rulers of Chan Chich designed some of their monumental architecture to function in part as the theater for public rituals and spectacles, including processions. The processional architecture at Chan Chich included the radial causeways, two possible terminus shrines, a massive range building, the ball court, and the main plaza.

Socioeconomic functions are also evident in the form of other specializations, one household producing specialty crops, another with spindle whorls for fine threads and groundstones, and another for painted gourds.The interpretation of evidence from Cerén documents the division of household groups into social units responsible for different economic needs within the community, which wove a deep fabric of social interaction. Physical markers of the Cerén landscape formed boundaries, agricultural fields separated by crop type, a sacbe and drainage canals dividing fields and providing transition from the border of the site center into the manioc field south of the community, and notably a large adobe block demarcating a division of space between fields, likely related to ownership.

During the complex negotiations between the various sectors involved it seems likely that the activities carried out through the sacbeob (e.g., processions, exchange of products) would have greatly mitigated the frictions which would have been created. Studies at the communities connected by the Ucí-Cansahcab sacbeob, in the NW plains of the Yucatan, are geared towards exploring these negotiations by considering multiple social sectors.

This site plan emphasizes a cruciform pattern, which we argue was intentional, and may symbolically represent the axis mundi. In the west, the sacbe is associated with a marketplace and ballcourt. The openness of this area reflects public participation in economic and ritual activities. As the sacbe narrows towards the east, access becomes more restricted. The sacbe terminates at a hilltop group (Group D) where excavations revealed evidence for repetitive ritual activities.

",Maya: Classic,Lithic Analysis,Political Economy,"Analysis of the production of imported lithic artifacts, especially obsidian and jade, has been important to recent research on the economic organization of the lowland Maya. However, the data for lithic production has come from a few key sites with clear evidence of workshops devoted to the working of such materials. Less attention has been dedicated to the diversity of obsidian and jade working within individual sites, much less across a given kingdom. This paper presents preliminary evidence for heterogeneity in obsidian and jade working in the kingdom of Piedras Negras, notable for being at the tail end in the exchange of obsidian, jade, and other imported lithic goods. The focus is especially on the diversity of production in household versus non-household areas, drawing comparisons with known market and production areas in Mexico and Guatemala, highlighting the connection with the subordinate center of Budsilha that yielded the best evidence to date for lithic production activities, to better understand regional economic dynamics. Macroscopic analyses are complemented by the results of XRF analysis.

Alternate travel routes through the valleys to the west  in Mexico crossed an even more complicated political landscape approaching the kingdoms of Palenque, Tonina, and Sak Tz’i’, as well as the plentiful minor centers and rural settlements throughout the region. While surveys between Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan in Guatemala have identified a definite border between the two kingdoms, research in Mexico has demonstrated a complex frontier that changed throughout the Late Classic period. Still, many of the sites identified by the Proyecto Arqueológico Busiljá-Chocoljá and others known from epigraphy can safely be associated with Piedras Negras at least for part of the Late Classic period, either based on proximity or emic accounts from inscriptions. Where carved monuments are absent, we must rely on archaeological evidence, primarily from ceramics and architecture, to understand this frontier zone of the kingdom of Piedras Negras.

Physicists, chemists, engineers, biologists, astronomers, and geoscientists have been among the first to adopt DBER, mostly at the undergraduate education level. Given research that demonstrates the effectiveness of instructional strategies derived from DBER, both at P-12 and undergraduate teaching, I call for archaeologists to adapt DBER, while developing infrastructure that supports and advances avenues of DBER and instructional implementation.

The goals of the fieldtrip generally align with the educational guidelines provided by each state.  This often means that archaeological modules or archaeology-themed fieldtrips are eliminated or reduced from curricula.

A tidal grist mill and a dam were established ca. 1750 at the mouth of Ash Creek. A corduroy road was constructed along the Creek’s salt marsh to link an early town road, the mill, and the Black Rock residents. Today, an intact 53-foot section of this road is visible at low tide, resting 36” below a mat of cord grass. It survives as an evocative remnant of a colonial road system. It appears to be the oldest remaining example of a preserved wooden road in the state and is a protected Archaeological Preserve.",3009,Symposium,Presenter,3009,Cece,Saunders

Brown anticipated and hoped that his actions might spur a rebellion that would spread throughout the South bringing freedom to all enslaved persons.  To some people he was a murderous lunatic; to others he was a martyr for the abolitionist cause; and, to many he was a hero whose actions sparked the onset of the Civil War.  Brown was willing to commit such extreme acts, including the deaths of his two sons because of his belief that slavery should be abolished at all costs.  

Following his execution, John Brown’s birthplace in the hills of northwestern Connecticut became a pilgrimage destination for those who revered the man and the principles he championed.  Although the house itself was destroyed by fire in 1918, the site has remained a destination for sightseers and admirers and is now a Connecticut Archaeological Preserve.  In order to better understand Brown’s motivations, one must examine his early life and the people and ideas that that most influenced him.

Approximately 8,700 artifacts were recovered from the site, primarily lithic tools made from locally sourced materials such as quartzite. These tools indicate the specific activity of fishing and processing.  Diagnostic artifacts recovered from the site indicate that it was utilized by indigenous people over the course of thousands of years, from the Middle Archaic to the Early Woodland. 
Among the site’s notable features is the presence of the diagonal weir, which is particularly useful compared to the traditional V shaped weir. This pattern allows for trapping activities to take place at lower water levels along the shore, whereas the V pattern concentrates the actions on the deeper, center portions of the waterway.  
This presentation will explore not only how the LeBeau site differs from other fishing sites found throughout Southern New England, but also how its artifacts provide a unique window into the past and how Native American people utilized the Quinebaug River as part of their seasonal subsistence strategy. And why these unique features included it to be listed as a State Archaeological Preserve.

Foremost among these additional benefits has been the forging of partnerships with the State Historic Preservation Office and inspiring stewardship for the sites so designated. While not every nominated site makes it to preserve status, just going through the process for consideration has made the value of these benefits more apparent to all involved. Nominations for archaeological preserve status have originated from a variety of concerned preservation groups, individual landowners, municipalities, state agencies, or at the request of SHPO.

While humans are indeed not always completely rational actors, their endeavors require either basic raw materials or environmental conditions that, when absent, either force them to seek out other regions for exploitation or adapt to new conditions.  Because of this, archaeologists have long been interested in the human response to the environment, particularly in areas of elevated risk.  This research seeks to address the variability in Virgin Branch Puebloan settlement patterns on the Shivwits Plateau though time as a response to socio-environmental stress.

In this paper, we present evidence from two sites (Zip Code and Zip Code 2) suggesting a pre-aggregation phase in BMIII or PI times.   These sites are  interesting because, although they are quite large,  extensive sites, they appear to be early in age because pottery is almost entirely unpainted and non corrugated, projectile point styles also seem to pre-date PII, and radiocarbon and OSL dates suggest a BMIII or PI  age.    Other large sites at Mt Trumbull  appear much more aggregated than the Zip Code sites, and  have been identified as PII based on pottery styles, radiocarbon and OSL dates.

The olivine-tempered ceramics are widely distributed in this region and the sources of olivine are in the highlands near Mt. Trumbull and Tuweep. Thus, the presence of olivine-tempered ceramics in the lowland Virgin area indicates economic and social ties between the highland and lowland populations. This ceramic compositional study using LA-ICP-MS suggests that the sources of the olivine-tempered ceramics found in the Mt. Trumbull and the lowland Virgin areas are not only in Mt. Trumbull but also in the lowland Virgin area, with the latter production centers having used olivine from Mt. Trumbull. The study also suggests that some of the olivine-tempered ceramics made in the lowland Virgin area were moved back to Mt. Trumbull. In this study, I explore the mechanisms of social interactions that moved olivine-tempered pots within various areas.

At first glance, the natural configuration of the coast seems to provide unobstructed passage, especially when compared with the rugged terrain of the adjacent highlands. The maps in many publications feature vague arrows marking trade or migration routes, giving the false impression that the coast was a broad unimpeded passageway. They generally omit details of topography and hydrography, and make no distinction among different parts of the coast. A closer look reveals important distinctions in the feasibility and comparative advantage of communication routes along the coastal piedmont, the coastal plain, and the Pacific littoral. The torrential rivers that cut across the coast posed important restrictions for east-west traffic, and in some cases, for north-south access from highland and piedmont sites to the coastal plain and littoral. In this talk, I will use ethnohistorical and geographic data to argue for finer assessment of coastal communication routes.

The author discusses the ways in which public art, architecture, and elite funerary contexts evolved at Kaminaljuyu during this time, evaluating how these changing styles may have tied into evolving relationships with distant sites and regions such as Teotihuacan, Veracruz, and the Maya lowlands. The Early Classic relationship between Kaminaljuyu and Teotihuacan has, in many ways, eclipsed the myriad other relationships evidenced by Kaminaljuyu’s material record during this time. The singular scholarly focus on the interaction between these two sites has created the impression that Early Classic Kaminaljuyu had a single, monolithic approach to foreign style and a single, primary foreign relationship. Stepping back to consider this time period more holistically, however, a pattern emerges instead of diachronic change and synchronic variation, with Kaminaljuyu laying claim to evolving sets of relationships with numerous foreign powers through time.

While most of the emphasis has been placed on the goods for which there is direct evidence of production and exchange—obsidian, jade, iron pyrite, and other lithic commodities present in abundance at these and other sites—Demarest, Dillon, and other scholars have posited that these sites were also important nodes of exchange for perishable goods that are harder to find in the archaeological record.

This presentation will focus on two of these perishable commodities—salt and quetzal feathers, both of which have ample ethnohistoric descriptions of their production during and after the Spanish conquest, and both of which are common in Classic Maya lowland iconography.

Given that some archaeologists have interpreted the appearance of the nixtamal/tortilla/comal complex in Guatemala as evidence of the “Mexicanization” of the Maya region, the Pacific coastal region of Guatemala -and its Central Mexican diasporic populations- is seen as the likely source of comales. As a result, comales are useful for tracking the degree/nature of entanglements between coastal and highland populations. Whatever the origin of comales, by the Colonial period, their presence is ubiquitous, despite the fact that documentary sources speak to strained interactions and severed social and economic networks between coastal Pipil and highland Kaqchikel communities. This paper explores coastal and highland interactions prior to and after colonization through the comparative Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) of comales at the Pacific piedmont Kaqchikel Maya site of San Pedro Aguacatepeque and Guatemalan coastal sites.

Historical ecology offers a holistic landscape approach to a phenomenon that archaeologically has often been viewed through shifts in diet and butchering practices. This study examines the creation of range practices at Spanish colonial Mission Lost Santos Angeles de Guevavi, near what is today Nogales, Arizona. Using multiple lines of evidence, this paper proposes a set of indicators to identify semi-feral ranching in both the archaeological and historical record. Isotopic evidence shows that semi-desert grasslands were most affected by the introduction of cattle and sheep. Faunal and historical analyses suggest cattle ages were loosely monitored, and animals were culled at an older age than optimal for meat and grease extractive strategies. These findings indicate a low investment strategy, which may have helped indigenous groups maintain traditional agricultural and gathering practices, augmenting their resilience in the colonial period. Finally, this paper explores how semi-feral cattle ranching was sustainable under historical conditions, but has since become an ecologically and politically problematic practice in the modern American West and used to justify U.S. federal interventions without community consultation on reservations.",3014,Symposium,Presenter,3014,Nicole,Mathwich

Among these drivers, human-driven environmental degradation has, for centuries, operated as a significant producer of inequality. Anthropogenic climate change today perpetuates and strengthens these multi-generational, regional-scale phenomena of landscape change. These processes, such as sediment erosion in Iceland during the past millennium, create a ‘second nature’ landscape of human design that create and reinforce resource scarcity and thus, social and economic inequality. These ‘second nature’ landscapes are self-perpetuating; their cause so viscous and nonlocal that they regularly defy our perception.

Six hypothesized painting episodes were identified based on motif type and panel position. pXRF measurements were taken on 8 motifs and 3 rock surfaces. Multivariate statistical analyses showed no significant differences in the hypothesized groupings and, in 2 cases, between motifs and unpainted rock, suggesting that variations in paint thickness, weathering and rock coatings affected the elemental measurements.

Our documentation methods utilize Structure from Motion 3D modeling, high resolution gigapanoramas, specialized recording forms, and GPS coordinates. We are collecting a dataset intended for future research and analyses including stylistic variation, attribute identification, and iconographic interpretation. To examine the feasibility of conducting such analyses from baseline data, a test analysis was conducted using a sample of the sites recorded thus far. We conducted figure identification, stylistic classification, and iconographic inventory using only the recording forms, gigapanoramas, and 3D models processed from baseline data.

The focus of this study is the use of portable X-ray fluorescence on Lower Pecos painted pebbles to conduct elemental analyses, providing insight into the chaîne opératoire of painted pebble production. Using a sample of recently excavated painted pebbles, as well as a sample from a private collection, a total of 257 pXRF measurements were collected on 73 pebbles. We determined that charcoal was used as a pigment for black paintings and that iron-based mineral pigments were used for red paintings. The 30 excavated pebbles range in age from ~8000 cal BP to 550 cal BP, and the stratigraphic and chronologic context of these pebbles provides a dataset for analyzing not only the chaîne opératoire of painted pebble production, but also allows us to analyze the potential for changes in production through time.

This style is characterized by finely executed anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures arranged in highly-ordered, complex compositions.

Zoomorphic figures of felines and deer are also represented with this pictographic element. ""Soul Expression"" explores the significance of this recurring motif in Pecos River style rock art and proposes that it is a graphic representation of breath, soul, and speech. In ancient Mexico, breath was believed to be a manifestation of one’s soul. Breath soul, when expressed in ritualized speech or song, was a powerful force engaged in both creation and maintenance of the cosmos. Graphic representations of breath soul and speech first appear in Mesoamerica during the Middle and Late Formative periods (900 to 100 BC) as volutes or scrolls issuing from the mouth of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures.

Not merely shelters, dwellings often incorporate subtle aspects of social life and world view while being literally structured by the capacities of raw materials and construction techniques. Rather than a passive reflection of human intention or social existence, dwellings result from  making—to use Tim Ingold’s notion, a perspective placing “the maker from the outset as participant in a world of active materials” in which the maker intervenes “in worldly processes that are already going on and which give rise to the forms of the living world.” Methodologically, ‘making’ is “read longitudinally, as a confluence of forces and materials, rather than laterally, as a transposition from image to object.” Further, the transformations of ancient dwellings into archaeological features and contexts engage with additional modes of ‘making’ as houses become sites. I apply these concepts to two different classes of late prehispanic dwellings in coastal Peru—casas de quincha in the Casma Valley and tabique dwellings in the Tumbes Valley—and discuss analytical challenges involved in a comparative study of Andean houses and households.",3018,Symposium,Presenter,3018,Jerry D.,Moore

Since people tend to clean activity areas, especially those that are used repeatedly, visible artifacts are rarely discovered in the context where they were originally used. Microartifact analysis focuses on the tiny fragments (<1 cm) of ceramics, bone, lithics, shell and other microartifacts that are produced as a result of human action. These tiny fragments are much more likely to remain in or near the context where they were originally produced because they are too small to be easily gathered and are often trampled into the soil matrixes of ancient surfaces. This study applies microartifactual sampling, processing and analytical techniques to characterize and compare the activities that took place on ancient surfaces at the site of Pampa la Cruz in Huanchaco, Peru. By examining the ubiquity of various microartifact categories per liter of excavated surface matrix, we isolate loci of food production, suggest which types of local and non-local foods were consumed, theorize about cooking practice and waste disposal, and examine traffic patterns in and around two Gallinazo structures.

Since 2010, I have been excavating multiple sites around Huanchaco bay, located in the littoral of the Moche Valley, North Coast of Peru. One particularity of this coastline is that there is still an active group of fishermen exploiting the sea resources using traditional technology. The continuity between the earliest occupation identified in this area (B.C. 1500-1200) and the present day fishermen is giving us a new perspective for exploring the social, economic and ideological trajectories of the Huanchaco community. In short, instead of framing archaeological occupations as Salinar or Moche, I propose a “Huanchaco identity” created over time by their economic and ideological relationship with the ocean.  To explore this possibility, I present the case of Pampa la Cruz, first occupied around B.C. 350/300 and abandoned roughly at 650/700 A.D. This occupation lasted for more than one thousand years in which this domestic settlement experienced several changes but also continuities in spatial organization and material culture.

The comparative age distributions consist of the 1870 California mortality census, 1870 California living census (as a proxy for a catastrophic population), mortality data from California military regulars, a hospital distribution, and a prehistoric distribution. The PSJ age distribution shows significant differences from all those groups except the hospital distribution. The PSJ sex ratio (approximately 3 females: 4 males) demonstrates similarities with the 1870 California mortality census.

Similar influences are inferred for past populations and the skeletal samples that represent them, including human remains from a pit at Point San Jose (PSJ), San Francisco. Employing all possible PSJ adult stature estimations in this analysis, they average 64.3 inches. The PSJ statures display a bimodal distribution, with peaks at 62 inches and 66 inches. That bimodality may result from a number of causes: small sample size, over-representation of a few individuals, ancestral differences, or sexual dimorphism. When compared with worldwide adult statures, the PSJ material display average stature. On the other hand, compared to a 19th century U.S. military sample, most members from PSJ stand shorter than that group by an average of 3.5 inches. This result suggests that the PSJ individuals faced impoverishment, deprivations and other challenges during their growth period.",3019,Symposium,Presenter,3019,P,Willey

Skeletal remains from a late 19th century military hospital at Point San Jose (PSJ), San Francisco, represent a commingled assemblage, complicating paleopathological observations on the bones. Unlike bony changes, dental pathologies are often studied by individual teeth. Consequently, observations of the PSJ dental remains are best interpreted using tooth counts. Dental disease and oral stress at PSJ include dental caries, dental wear, dental calculus, and LEH. Frequency data show that 32/165 teeth (19.4%) exhibit LEH.

For most of this time, the use of cadavers was neither ethical, nor legal. In U.S. medical study today, most cadavers come from body donation programs largely resulting from the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA), first proposed in 1968. The UAGA followed a change in social context of cadavers. It introduced the body as property and provided individuals the right to donate their body following death. Before the mid-1900s, the lack of legal avenues for the acquisition of cadavers led to the 18th century practice of grave robbing. In the U.S., “Resurrectionists” exhumed and sold recently buried bodies to anatomists. To stop grave robbing, anatomy acts were introduced in the late 18th/early 19th century. Governed at the state level, these laws outlined which bodies could be obtained legally for use as cadavers. Most laws allowed the bodies of criminals, suicides, indigent, or unclaimed individuals to be used as cadavers. The Point San Jose collection offers an opportunity to understand the social context of anatomy laws during the 19th century and identify those people used in anatomical studies.

Within this context, this paper presents a model for the initiation, establishment, and maintenance of permanent high altitude settlements, especially in middle latitudes. This model takes into account the limiting factors found in such settings, the costs and benefits of different ways of coping with these limitations, and the contexts under which different behavioral strategies and physiological changes might be expected to be selected either for or against. The model is evaluated with archaeological data from the Rockies, Intermountain West and the Argentine Andes. This evaluation suggests that in most scenarios demographic packing triggers increasingly intensive high altitude use, that establishing semi-permanent or permanent settlements requires economic subsidization with lower-altitude resources and increasingly costly high altitude ones, and that maintenance of high altitude lifeways is tenuous and contingent upon both biological adaptation and/or articulation with larger regional economies.",3020,Symposium,Presenter,3020,Christopher,Morgan

Over 750 sites of all periods (276 prehistoric components) are recorded over an area encompassing seven 1:24,000 scale maps.

Located in western Eurasia, at the crossroads of human migrations out of Africa during the Pleistocene, the Iranian Plateau stands at the centre of models of anatomically modern human dispersals out of Africa. This paper aims to understand the cultural diversity among the first modern human populations in the area, and the implications of this diversity to evolutionary and ecological models of human dispersal through the Iranian Plateau, by re-examining four key UP lithic assemblages from the sites Warwasi, Yafteh and Pasangar of the west central and Ghār-e Boof Cave of the southern Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The results demonstrate that there is a significant degree of cultural diversity rather than homogeneity among the UP throughout the different Zagros habitat areas as a result of the relative geo-topographical isolation of the different areas occupied favouring different ecological adaptations. Based on the chronological and geographical patterns of Zagros UP variability, we propose a model of an initial phase of localised and patchy development of the early UP in the region, with limited subsequent contact among these first UP groups. This has important implications for the origins of biological diversity in the early phases of modern human colonisation of Eurasia.",3020,Symposium,Presenter,3020,Elham,Ghasidian

To date, the empirical evidence indicates an initial appearance of humans in the high Andes (up to 4500 m above sea level) in the Terminal Pleistocene, about 12,500 years ago. Early forager sites of the Andes exhibit a spectrum of settlement and mobility configurations, which constitute responses to the structure of resources in their specific habitats. Intriguingly, some of the earliest and highest sites indicate thorough familiarity with highland resources, implying either considerable pre-existing cultural knowledge about mountains or very rapid landscape learning. Current debates center on the identification of explorations vs more permanent settlements, functional configurations of early highland sites with those in lower ecological zones, and the role of physiologic and genetic adaptations in the settlement process. Approaches relying solely on assemblages of artifacts and subsistence remains may be inadequate to resolve these issues.

",Paleolithic,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis,Trade and Exchange,"Humans have frequented southern Africa’s highest reaches – Lesotho’s Maloti-Drakensberg Mountains – for ≥90,000 years. As with many high mountain systems worldwide, the Maloti-Drakensberg cast a rainshadow over closely neighboring arid lowlands (the eastern Karoo Desert). Based on previous archaeological and paleoenvironmental work in highland Lesotho, researchers have posited that source populations for human dispersals into the mountain zone often originated in the Karoo, particularly during phases of enhanced regional aridity or climatic instability. Lesotho’s mid/high-altitude temperate grasslands may have been attractive to lowland desert foragers because they offer topographical resource diversity and stable supplies of key resources. Such dynamics would have necessitated the existence and maintenance of strong cultural linkages between these ecologically contrasting macro-regions. To begin testing these hypotheses, we are conducting strontium isotope analyses of ostrich eggshell beads recovered from Sehonghong, a highland Lesotho rock shelter with a record of human occupation stretching from the late Holocene to early Marine Isotope Stage 3, and constructing terrestrial strontium isoscapes in both regions.

Field school excavations conducted between 1946 and 1960 uncovered compelling traces of immigrants from the Kayenta region of far northeastern Arizona and southeastern Utah. Noting evidence of a fire in the part of the pueblo referred to as the Maverick Mountain phase roomblock, and the rarity of Maverick Mountain Series pottery in deposits post-dating the conflagration, Haury concluded that the locals at Point of Pines burned these rooms in order to drive the Kayenta immigrants out. Recent research with the site’s collections and their associated records has revealed indications of ritual architectural closure behavior similar to that documented at the Homol’ovi villages, a key indicator being enriched deposits. The nature of these deposits suggests that, rather than the locals, the immigrants set fire to the roomblock. In this paper, we describe this new evidence and consider the implications for understanding interactions between locals and immigrants at Point of Pines.",3022,Symposium,Presenter,3022,Patrick,Lyons

Ethnographic accounts also indicate the importance of macaws to ancient Puebloan peoples and modern groups. Macaws have been interpreted as indicators of exchange, aspects of intricate ritual systems, and indexes of social complexity. This research attempts to further our understanding of the roles macaw imagery have played in Puebloan culture through an analysis of images on pottery and the depositional contexts of the vessels or vessel fragments bearing these representations at the Homol’ovi Settlement Cluster, a 13th-14th century ancestral Hopi group of villages located in northeastern Arizona. Is macaw imagery tied to certain wares, types, or vessel forms? How are these birds depicted on ceramics?  Are items adorned with macaw imagery and macaw skeletal remains deposited in similar contexts? Considering the contexts in which objects decorated with macaw imagery were deposited in reference to macaw and other bird burial practices may provide a more refined understanding of the functions these artifacts served and the symbolism they evoked in prehistoric Puebloan society.",3022,Symposium,Presenter,3022,Claire,Barker

Ethnographic evidence indicates that prophets realize their visions, in part, by transforming relationships between people and material objects. They shun, embrace, or reorient technologies, artifacts, and architecture.  Not surprisingly, in cultures where spiritual forces already animate artifacts and architecture, such reorganizations can produce dramatic changes in material culture. Much of the revitalization and crisis cult literature has logically focused on the role that colonialism played in creating new religious movements. Prehistoric contexts, however, exhibit a broader range of underexplored contexts such as environmental stress, disease, and war. The ethnographic and historical records of the American Southwest suggest revitalization movements extend far into the past. We argue that widespread changes in material culture associated with significant inflection points in southwestern prehistory (circa A.D. 700s, 1000s, and 1300s) document the work of ancient prophets.

",Other,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis,Social and Political Organization: States and Empires,"Anthropological research suggests that early states and empires frequently relied on state-sponsored building projects to produce networks of state control and identity on the landscape. The production and use of monumental architecture, however, can also be influenced by local agency, resilience and/or resistance, and degrees of socio-political autonomy. Rather than a homogenous blanket of state/imperial power, the result is a mosaic of core state control and local choices across the landscape. Focusing on the Angkorian Khmer Empire (9th to 15th c. CE), this paper employs a landscape network approach to investigate degrees of state control and evidence of intermediate elite power, thus providing a more dynamic perspective of the imperial landscape. These investigations are informed through an analysis of the assemblage of provincial sandstone temples, which were key loci for the negotiation of state and intermediate elite power within the Khmer Empire. Emphasis is placed on understanding the geographic distribution of temples, the acquisition of sandstone for temple production, and temple form and organization, as variations in these variables may reflect different intermediate elite strategies and levels of agentive decision making.",3023,Symposium,Presenter,3023,Kendall,Hills

Artisans built its temples, sculpted temple images, and cast metal goods; specialists and communities tended temples; and voracious elites broadcast political and religious affairs in stone and through pageantry. Some archaeologists studying the multiscalar, multicentric nature of Angkorian production focus on ceramics as proxies for tracking state economy within and beyond Angkor’s urban epicenter. Stoneware ceramics were neither wealth nor staple finance; their functions complemented earthenware and metal objects; and they were ubiquitous in Angkorian households across the kingdom. Kiln excavations in three discrete Angkorian subregions have produced in-situ ceramics; field projects across Cambodia offer samples from consumption sites.

Inevitably the question arises as to whose past is being interpreted and who has the right to interpret it, and the discipline has sought ways to address those questions with the help of communities invested in that knowledge and of the media. Archaeologists now form part of the different communities invested in access to knowledge of the past where these communities seek to advocate for different voices to be heard. How these communities interact with the public and the role that broadcast, print, and social media play in those interactions is the focus of this proposed forum where members of the media, archaeologists, and stakeholder of the past communities share their thoughts to start a conversation about these communities’ goals and expectations from each other and from the public, and how those goals and expectations play out on public medium forums and how these translate into other forms of civic advocacy such as activism, lobbying, legislation, and program implementation.",3024,Forum,Moderator (Primary),3024,Nezahualcoyotl,Xiuhtecutli

Birds possess specific traits and engage in a variety of behaviors that directly affect the mechanics of capture and use, such as gregariousness and flock size, preferences in nesting and feeding locations, wing strength and readiness to flush, and aggressiveness and territoriality. Human-bird relationships also move beyond the semantics of capture to cases in which birds are kept in captivity as sources of feathers and/or awaiting sacrifice, as pets, and as domestic birds. Chaco Canyon, New Mexico was the center of a large regional system in the Pueblo II period (AD 850-1150). The avifaunal assemblages from one great house, Pueblo Bonito, and two small sites, BC 57 and BC 58, will be examined and compared.

But no simple model of unidirectional causation, whether by natural agents or humans, really does justice to the situation. Disease responds to social and biological environments (for instance, settlement distributions affecting contagion, and poverty and malnutrition compromising the immune system), and it has complex effects on society.

Sub-Saharan Africa, like many other parts of the Old World where past mass mortalities were not documented, has been omitted from the debate about the impact of pandemics on deep historical trajectories. This paper suggests that the second pandemic of plague—the infamous fourteenth century Black Death—was responsible for demographic crises south of the Sahara, which in turn created opportunities for new elite groups to emerge. I will discuss possible short- and long-term impacts of and responses to the plague crisis in the 14th century by different communities living in the forest environment of West Africa, as manifested in the archaeological and oral historical records of southern Ghana and south-western Nigeria.

Animals are important resources of food, labor, and secondary products in many societies, as well as symbolically important features of the ritual landscape. As relationships with animals intensify, processes such as domestication ensure that humans are potentially able to control the behavior and deployment of large numbers of animals, altering ecosystems and creating an anthropogenic landscape. However, these types of relationships are heavily structured by the innate attributes of the animals involved. Pre-evolved characteristics create the set of possibilities on which human agents can act, and actions undertaken by animals without the influence of humans can have major impacts on human behavior. Because of this, evaluating “human” environments as complete ecosystems with multiple players is an important part of understanding how we exist within the environment.",3026,Symposium,Presenter,3026,Steven,Ammerman

While much attention has been paid to the political context of agricultural production, as well as environmental changes brought about by certain techniques, less has been paid to the active manipulation of productive environments by non-human animals. Within the context of some recent theoretical advances in archaeology and ecology, it has become apparent that animals - intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans - modify the context under which agricultural production occurs. These modified landscapes are inherited by subsequent generations of producers who are challenged to make minor, and sometimes major, adjustments based on changing landscapes. In this paper, we highlight these processes using case studies from historic North America (e.g., earthworms) and the pre-European Pacific (e.g., rats and birds). We demonstrate that the ecosystem modifications and services provided by animals created a particular kind of path dependency that had ramifications for past peoples, and continues to have consequences for present producers.",3026,Symposium,Presenter,3026,Seth,Quintus

Yet the question of what drives social change, human actions or climatic factors, is still quite hard to discern. My case study focuses on non-human agency, particularly eroding landforms and climatic conditions, as forces of change in pre-contact East Polynesia. A Society Island case study outlines varied human responses to expected events, such as soil creep onto agricultural terraces, and cataclysmic ones, such as major landslides, tropical cyclones, and flooding. Some cataclysmic events had remarkably deleterious short-term effects, but in the long-term created more advantageous residential and agricultural conditions for the indigenous Ma'ohi. Other short-term cataclysmic events were successfully buffered with new adaptations, spurring cultural innovation. Maʻohi efforts to combat soil erosion, due to both natural and human causes, led to remarkably labor-intensive inputs into the pre-contact socio-economic system. From a behavioral ecological perspective, both nature and culture shaped Ma'ohi habitats. East Polynesian case studies support that decision makers often lacked information about the long-term consequences of their actions, yet could sometimes rapidly adapt and integrate new forms of traditional ecological knowledge into their socioecosystems.",3026,Symposium,Presenter,3026,Jennifer,Kahn

From mineral exploration and mining to primary metal production, manufacturing, and consumption across a range of social contexts, metallurgy influenced a wide range of distinctly human conditions. However, while metals are particularly transmutable, they also rapidly corrode back into increasingly stable mineral compounds in processes that people tried to mitigate and often unsuccessfully overcame. This paper discusses how metal production and consumption leads to this poorly studied phenomenon of material fatigue, where metals embrittled, corrode and ultimately fail, giving way to potentially systematic societal and environmental upheaval with oftentimes unpredictable and disastrous effects. Using ancient and modern case studies, this paper will then examine the human response to overcome the problems of material fatigue. In particular, we examine the case of the 1200 BC Cape Gelidonya Shipwreck found off the coast of southwestern Turkey, and whose cargo of copper ingot and alloy scrap metal demonstrates how some sectors of society worked alongside consumers to recycle fatigued metal. Examination of this metallurgical cycle – from minerals to metals and back again – affords a new perspective on the role of metal technology in human societies.",3026,Symposium,Presenter,3026,Joseph,Lehner

This paper offers a survey of earthquakes as non-human change agents in the Roman and Late Antique Mediterranean, with especial focus on the cities of Ephesus, Antioch, and Phrygian Hierapolis. While contemporary Roman sources tend to describe urban rebuilding after earthquakes in a symbolic manner with a generic picture of cities “rebuilt” (ἀνοικοδομίσθαι) or “restored” (ἀνενέοθι) with state-directed support in coin or labor, these literary images rarely correspond with the archaeological evidence.

The monsoon winds are the lifeline of this region but also a major threat, inspiring societies to devise mechanisms to both harness their potential and subvert the damage they may cause. This paper analyzes prehistoric and historical responses to monsoons in South Asia in terms of their unpredictable nature, and examines how the monsoons both facilitate and constrict people’s actions. In doing so, the paper compares societal responses to monsoons in the different contexts of rurality and urbanity, which each exert specific exigencies over individual and collective actions. In both situations, conserving seasonal rainwater is crucial to the sustenance of societies but an excess of that water can cause significant destruction. Poets of the past and the present allude to the vagaries of the monsoons, reflecting a society conscious of monsoons’ deceits, but even today, it is nearly impossible to predict how much it might rain, when, and where. The paper thus urges archaeological studies of water infrastructure to take into consideration both human agency and the agency of the monsoons.",3026,Symposium,Presenter,3026,Kanika,Kalra

Flowing water can build and destroy landscapes rapidly in dramatic fashion as with flash flooding or gradually through incremental natural processes, shaping the terrain through sedimentation, erosion, and seasonal fluctuations in water flow. Within human societies, these waterways may be perceived as a source of danger, but also provide subsistence and non-subsistence resources, and serve as landscape features that alter how people move through the physical world. Though scholars widely recognize the extent to which humans have incorporated flowing water into cultural processes such as for trade, this paper focuses on the idea that waterways introduce possibilities and limitations to which communities respond. I consider several case studies in North America, with a focus on the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, to show that flowing water is not a passive element of the human environment, but an active participant in the creation of  physical and social worlds.

Incremental processes of natural change, such as soil creep, vegetation growth, oxidation, and material fatigue similarly act against human intentionality by causing deterioration and decay whose denouement is unpredictable in timing and magnitude. The sentient world of animals, in which behavioral patterns have evolved for viability in a diverse world of predators and reproduction strategies, similarly presents challenges when managed under the assumption that humans are the primary determinant of comportment. In this session, speakers will consider the agentive effects of natural phenomena to which the direct human response is primarily reactive.

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Material Culture and Technology,"Jebel Faya is a key Paleolithic site in Arabia. The site provides important data on the history of human occupation of desert environments during the Late Pleistocene. One central question is if the observed diachronic pattern of occupation is largely driven by climatic change, as often assumed, or if other factors such as adaptation processes play significant roles. Based on the assumption that survival in the often unpredictable environments of SE Arabia requires increased behavioral flexibility and risk minimizing strategies this paper examines Jebel Faya’s Paleolithic stone artifact assemblages with regard to economization of lithic raw material and the intensification of social relations. Attributes such as production efficiency and re-use potential represent raw material economization, while technological complexity, occupation intensity and raw material provisioning are used to deduce an indirect estimate for the intensity of social relations. To assess the degree of economization and social relation, the archaeological assemblages are compared to data modeled under optimality assumption using a probabilistic approach based on Naïve Bayes classifier. These results were used to track changes in social relations and raw material economy through the archaeological sequence from Jebel Faya to see if these data provide meaningful information on differences in social learning.",3028,Symposium,Presenter,3028,Knut,Bretzke

Yet when this becomes evident in our oldest cultural proxy, lithic artifacts, is hotly debated. Much of the variation in how archaeologists study this question is caused by differing assumptions related to the constraints on the performance, and thus the learning, of the flintknapping process. This paper explores the consequences of the physical constraints within lithic technology on its cultural transmission, using a spatially-explicit agent-based model. Building off of our previous work (PLoSOne 2016), we examine the incomplete social learning of the technological knowledge to produce curated lithic tool kits. We measure the number of learning events produced under the different constraints within flintknapping that reside at the heart of this debate. These constraints include where the learning occurred on the taskscape, the significance of the cognitive difference between strategic knowledge and tactical know-how, the degree of equifinality of products from different sequences, the generative entrenchment between products and sequences, and the size of the parameter space of lithic technology. Using the developmental utility of our model, we discuss ways to improve both experimental and artifactual studies designed to test for social learning during the Stone Age.",3028,Symposium,Presenter,3028,Gilbert,Tostevin

One explanation for this puzzling degree of conservatism is that Acheulean tools were not culturally transmitted but rather genetically determined.

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Cultural Transmission,"Social learning by modern humans led to the repetition and persistence of stone tool forms we see in the recent archaeological record. The emergence of similar patterning in early hominin assemblages is often assumed to track the beginnings of social learning. Less clear is what was being socially transmitted during this early period. One possibility is that hominins learned how to make objects according to a shared ‘mental template’. A second possibility is that specific sequences were learned, which led to repeated forms. Here we describe recent experiments that explored the interplay of stone-flaking intentions and the mechanical outcomes of fracture. By removing complex ‘intent’ from the experimental design, we demonstrated that repetitions in forms and sequences can occur by removing flakes in simple series, without complex goal-directed intentions, and that some of these forms mimic aspects of objects often assumed to reflect more complex cognitive processes. The emergence of repetitive form is possible through the transmission of simple stoneworking sets, or combinations of gestures, without an a priori conception of a manufacturing process or final goal, suggesting that complex forms of social transmission may not have been necessary until relatively late in evolutionary history.",3028,Symposium,Presenter,3028,Mark,Moore

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Cultural Transmission,"The ability to transmit cultural information with high-fidelity across generations is a defining trait of modern humans. It is unclear, however, how and when this adaptation emerged in the human lineage. The earliest forms of human technology—stone artifacts—required knappers to understand raw material mechanics, as well as geometry (volume reduction, angles), and physics. Thus, it is often assumed that the spread of lithic technologies involved some degree of information transmission. However, archaeologists lack systematic methods to study the transmission of information from lithic palimpsests. A growing interest in this topic has emphasized design theory (Carr 1995), breaking down lithic technology into a series of independent domains of lithic production (Tostevin 2012) (e.g. core orientation, platform preparation). The research presented here used controlled knapping experiments to understand the influence of varied social learning conditions on these technological domains. The ultimate goal is to define attributes that can be used as proxies for information transmission in Paleolithic assemblages. We simulated two social learning conditions: emulation (lower-fidelity) and imitation (higher-fidelity) as novice knappers were taught Levallois technology. Results suggest that attributes associated with core orientation are more strongly correlated with degree of information transfer than attributes of toolkit morphology.",3028,Symposium,Presenter,3028,Kathryn,Ranhorn

Here we present results from an experimental neuroarchaeology study of individual variation in handaxe-making skill acquisition. Naïve subjects received ~100 hrs training over several months, accompanied by regular behavioral, psychometric, and MRI assessments. To quantify skill, knapping performance was observed after every 10 hrs training and rated using a systematic rubric. We fit a multivariate model of artifact metrics to these ratings to derive an objective “quality” score and regressed quality scores on hours practice per subject to derive individual learning curves. The multivariate model identifies morphological correlates of knapping performance whereas parameters and values from individual learning curves can be directly compared with individual differences in brain structure and psychometric performance. Our results are an initial step toward better understanding the roles of skill acquisition and differential aptitude in generating lithic variability and shaping human neurocognitive evolution.",3028,Symposium,Presenter,3028,Dietrich,Stout

Despite intriguing differences in brain activity (measured with fNIRS) between these groups, the mode of social transmission has yet to reveal significant effects on handaxe morphology, suggesting that verbal teaching may not have been necessary for the social reproduction of early stone toolmaking skill. We coded video-recordings of subject performance using BORIS event-logging software and a knapping ethogram to test for possible behavioral differences between conditions that might explain observed differences in brain activity and indicate influences of teaching on early-stage skill acquisition that are difficult to detect from artifacts.

In response, sugar planters in 18th century Antigua, West Indies, deforested over 90 percent of the landscape, carving the island into proto-industrialized plantations defined by sugarcane monoculture and labored by enslaved Africans. New World plantation organization was once ascribed as a balance between profit and surveillance: simultaneously maximizing control over the landscape and enslaved labor.  However, evidence from Antigua questions aspects of these earlier notions.  This paper examines the socio-spatiality of the late 18th century Antiguan plantationscape. Specifically, this research builds upon the analysis of Bates (2015) in Jamaica and Nevis, conducting a diachronic and synchronic analysis of seven different plantations in Antigua owned by the Codrington family, including Betty’s Hope [1655-1944], New Works [before 1710], Cotton Estate [before 1710], Tuitts Estate [before 1750], Rooms Estate [1717-1852], Clare Hall [1814-1848 (at least)], Jennings Estate [1772-1815], and Bolans Estate [1772-1815] to determine whether plantation layout sought to maximize profit or surveillance.

Social implications of factories and productive landscapes in the Caribbean have often been obscured by the socio-cultural palimpsest of plantation environments. Material culture studies of Caribbean factories, both structures and machinery, can be vital descriptors regarding enslaved and emancipated labour narratives. The connection between industrialisation, machinery, slavery, and manumission underlies major themes of the plantation organism. The industrialisation of the factory complex generated a newly habituated space and altered perceptions of workspaces from one of slavery and semi-artisanal, cottage-manufacture to constant mechanised motion, noise and ‘free’-production. Using the term anthropomorphic-machinism to cover both the relationship of workers to technologies being manipulated, it is possible to characterise the effect of machinery on the organisms themselves (labourers). Despite their continued financial confinement, Abolition marked the ‘freedom’ of the labourer from the yolk of oppressive production. The introduction of industrialised steam machinery replaced the corporeal labour of the enslaved. The relationships developed between the labourer and the workplace is depicted within their interaction with procedure, machinery, technology and, eventually, the product.

Our research reassesses this claim by using geometric morphometric analysis to study 547 Aurignacian osseous implements recovered from 49 European sites. This approach allowed the identification of eight volumetric templates reproduced by Aurignacian artisans during the manufacture of split-based points. Two templates were identified for massive-based points, one of which includes a number of variants. Spatial and chronological distribution of these templates suggests the dominant hypothesis must be reconsidered. We argue that Aurignacian armatures signal the development of innovative socioeconomic strategies by groups already present on the continent and linked to one another. In this case, the osseous armatures would have conferred an adaptive technological solution to prehistoric groups engaged in increased mobility. The subsequent adoption of the innovation at a continental scale must be linked with the dispersal of the Campanian Ignimbrite tephra.

However, research in some localities that clearly sample closed habitats do not yield hominins.

Yet, the Mursi Formation has no hominins while the other localities with dryer and more open habitats do, suggesting that early hominins could not occupy exclusively closed habitat and were reliant on resources found in more open settings.

The dualistic layout of the huaca’s ceremonial nucleus resonates with general Andean philosophies that moral order was founded on the balanced if dialectical interdependence of male and female forces.  However, an investigation of the ritual practices of the center along with the spatial differentiation of gender-specific activities within the larger site reveals some of the distinguishing features of Late Moche ideologies of sex and complementarity.  Ideals of male, female, and their union (yanatin) were spatially inscribed and appear to have formed the common denominator of a whole series of complementary oppositions, including production and consumption, life and death, senior and junior, day and night, highland and lowlands, and possibly sky and earth.

The Moche are well-known for their representations of warriors and warfare, as well as the sacrificial rituals associated with the taking of prisoners. However, this martial focus was not consistent across Moche time and space, and regional variations indicate the existence of a potential field of expression which was used differently in different areas and times. In this paper, I explore that potential field of expression, and the representations of gender that could exist outside of the strongly-gendered warriors and priests. I focus instead on the center of a Moche spectrum of gender that had women at one end and men on the other. Clothing could cover areas of the body associated with gender identity, and diagnostic elements such as hairstyle could be covered or simply not expressed.

Many examples of human sacrifice have been identified recently across the north coast of Peru involving a range of time periods and bodily treatment to suggest that there was incredible variation in practice, including in the identity of those sacrificed. Both males and females have been identified as sacrifices, but rarely are both found within the same sacrifice tradition suggesting that gender identity often played a role. This paper explores the various human sacrificial contexts at Túcume (1000-1532 CE) specifically focusing on the 19 young females from Huaca Larga who were inferred as an Inca Aqlla; supposedly killed to accompany the principal ruler at his dead. While no direct perimortem trauma is evident, they do conform to mortuary treatments of human offerings. The osteological analysis of pathological stress markers suggests that these women did not necessarily lead lives of honored status, but suffered cranial trauma, dental disease, and episodic stress during childhood.

The sudden appearance of that specific character is echoed in the sacred imagery where the priestess is depicted, as a supernatural women enacting in complex ritual activities with other elite characters. This new imagery introduces an era where powerful women are made visible and contributes to the construction of a normative image of the Moche deity. While the necessary and contingent reasons for their sudden appearance remain unclear, some questions still remain regarding the women who were buried as their personification.

All depicted dogs appear to share the same phenotypic traits, and hunting scenes show up to 21 dogs in a single group.

To test this hypothesis, we are generating nuclear genomes of ~10 Mesolithic dogs sampled from sites in Europe and Western and Eastern Russia, and mitochondrial genomes from ~400 dogs spanning the last 15,000 years across Eurasia. The results of this analysis will reveal the phylogenetic affinities of dogs that were present across the Old World prior to the introduction of dogs associated with farming communities.

The Arctic was the gateway for at least 4 independent waves of migration of dogs into the Americas, beginning as early as ~17,500-13,000 years ago, making this region particularly important for investigating not only the cultural and technological functions of Arctic dogs, but also the impact of successive introductions in the past 1,000 years on the high-latitude adaptations of prehistoric Arctic human populations.
 This paper will focus on the integrated use of genetics, GMM and isotopes to reconstruct individual and population life-histories of prehistoric Arctic domestic dogs. This combination of interrelated analyses allows for a comprehensive investigation into genetic, morphological and dietary variability for the identification of domesticates from archaeological assemblages, and for examining the relationship between domesticates and wild canids in archaeological contexts. Our results demonstrate that this three-strand analytical investigation can shed new light on continuity and change in human-canid relationships during these periods of migration, providing valuable information about the relationship between humans and animals in prehistory, and the complex cultural and technological diffusions of successive human migrations across the Arctic.",3032,Symposium,Presenter,3032,Carly,Ameen

Domestic but not livestock, they typically share human space and diet more than most herd animals. They are more likely to be considered persons, with souls – a trait they share with wild animals. Here I examine the spiritual status of dogs in early Near Eastern herding societies, as livestock-keeping spread through the region and it became possible to situate dogs in relation to other domestic animals as well as wild ones. I rely primarily on data from Çatalhöyük in central Anatolia, where I have extensive contextual information, supported by patterning from other PPNB/early Pottery Neolithic sites. Drawing on the contextual analysis of animal bones, burial practices, and animal representations, I argue that dogs were not regarded in the same way as wild animals, but that they held greater spiritual power than domestic sheep and goats. This power is evident through taboos: on human consumption of dogs, and on dogs entering occupied houses.

",Paleolithic,Mortuary Analysis,Mortuary Archaeology,"Throughout prehistory, dogs and humans have sometimes been interred together in the same grave, in different locations in the world. This practice raises the question of why this practice was so prevalent. Circumstances leading to this practice were variable, but its consistency suggests an underlying factor in common. Using one of the earliest known cases as a point of departure, Bonn-Oberkassel from Germany, we suggest that this underlying factor in common is that dogs and people were regarded similarly. Further, as part of developing that framework, we suggest that in certain cases, simultaneous human-dog interments may not so much have reflected one or more dogs being buried with people, but rather one or more people being buried with dogs.

It is unclear how far back the current modern morphology of dogs goes, or how different ancient dogs were from their modern descendants. Here we present the results of analyses examining the differences between archaeologically identified dogs with modern domestic dogs, modern wolves and Pleistocene wolves to see how these groups have morphologically diverged. To do this we will examine the morphologies of both the mandible and the first mandibular molar and compare the through-time shape change of archaeological dogs to the baseline of shape variation of each of the reference groups.

Not only was Lingnan distant from imperial centers in the north, its native pre-literate ‘Yue’ inhabitants spoke non-sinitic languages and were known for their distinctive ‘uncivilized’ behaviors. Along with its location at the southern margin of modern China’s territory, the fact that political, cultural and material elements originating north of it did have a significant impact on Lingnan’s long-term development further helps mark the region as ‘peripheral’. However, by focusing on unidirectional currents emanating from distant political centers, one risks underestimating the influence of areas ‘beyond the periphery’, as the case of Lingnan illustrates when one takes into account material and cultural elements which reached southern China along the ‘Maritime Silk Road’.

Often distance between such diverging theoretical trajectories is mitigated by communication and collaboration across borders between scholars. However, the Cold War that divided Western and Soviet nations geographically, politically, and culturally also applied to archaeological research, as the flow of information and people across borders was stifled. Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the mostly normalized relations that developed afterwards, a scholarly Iron Curtain has remained, diminished but enduring. Though certainly not as rigid as decades past, such a divide is visible in the limited number of American scholars conducting research in modern Russian, and in the exclusion of Russian research from our narratives about the prehistoric and ancient past. This paper examines the legacy of the Cold War in American archaeology, specifically in relation to the marginalization of Russian archaeological phenomena in our popular narratives.

",Bronze Age,Other,Materiality,"Archaeologists studying prehistoric Eurasian steppe pastoral lifeways often seek inclusion into comparative research of urbanism, craft production, and complexity. Even as these studies contribute valuable information, they also reify their place in the intellectual periphery of archaeological inquiry. This peripheralization is due to several factors. First, the Eurasian steppe is perhaps unwittingly conceptualized as a relatively timeless socio-geographical periphery to “state-level” social entities located to the adjacent south - western Asia, south-central Asia, and east Asia. Second, this peripheralization is ultimately a spatially-derived frame of mind, one that essentializes and promotes geographic and cultural space over equally important considerations of time and materiality. In the following paper, I interrogate the spatio-centric mindsets that permeate current studies of Eurasian steppe pastoral social groups; a mindset that contributes to the further marginalization of pastoral-based case studies in anthropological archaeology. To break out of this exclusionary mindset, I explore the ways in which meaning was made in Bronze Age pastoral groups through a more inclusive inquiry drawing upon ethnographic and archaeological case studies to illustrate how pastoralists engaged with time and materials (as well as space) as they undergo periods of social change and continuity.",3035,Symposium,Presenter,3035,James,Johnson

However, these perceptions continue to color interpretations of Appalachia’s deeper past, despite the region’s long tradition of rigorous archaeological research. Some scholars have suggested that pre-Columbian Appalachia has remained peripheral in archaeological discourse because it comprised the geographic edge of different cultural expressions (e.g., Mississippian, Morrow Mountain) or interaction spheres. In this paper, we argue that Appalachia’s recurring position as a cultural boundary renders it uniquely suited for studying pre-Columbian interaction and connectivity. Drawing on spatial and contextual data from the New River headwaters of northwestern North Carolina, we attempt to reframe the southern Appalachians as socially and symbolically central to Woodland period events and histories, and we propose new lines of archaeological research to further interrogate erroneous impressions of the region’s inaccessibility, isolation, and cultural inertia.",3035,Symposium,Presenter,3035,Alice,Wright

When I do, I am often greeted with surprise, confusion, and a polite suggestion that I should be in Papua New Guinea or other places where German anthropologists engage with people who are perceived as different from contemporary Europeans. In Central Europe, archaeology is traditionally tied to history and the people of its past are often assumed to be just like “us.” Interpretive frameworks to explain the Iron Age, have long been derived from European medieval history, such as the concept of the Fürstensitz (“princely seat”) of the early Iron Age, or from the European Classics, such as the notion that ubiquitous late Iron Age rectilinear enclosures (Viereckschanzen) are functionally similar to Greek temples. While a new generation of German scholars embraces critical history and social theory, the idea that the later European past is a familiar place is persistent.

In modern archaeological practice, certain regions and areas of study have been treated as peripheral to more central phenomenon. A considerable amount of literature since the 1990s has problematized unidirectional and monodimensional models of interregional interaction, premised on migration, diffusion, world-systems, state expansion, empire building, and more. However, despite considerable critique and increasing engagement with multidirectional and multi-scalar models for such interactions, many regions and moments in time remain outside traditional archaeological focus. This session examines areas of archaeological research that have been pushed to the margins of the discipline. Crossing chronological and regional boundaries, the papers presented here offer a global perspective on the causes and effects of disciplinary peripheralization in theory and practice.

I use data from the site of Calixtlahuaca to evaluate the archaeological validity of such stereotypical practices for one group, the Matlatzinca. In particular, I focus on the heavy reliance on maguey, and locally distinctive foodways relating to maize. I then consider whether these practices became more or less pronounced once the area came under Triple Alliance rule. I find that there is a modest shift toward more characteristically Aztec practices in both activities over time, but that these changes are highly unevenly distributed among households. Given that both of the activities under consideration are relatively low-visibility, household-level practices, it is unlikely that they were specifically targeted by Aztec imperial policies.

In such contexts, ethnic identities, constructed around concepts of blood, race, language, or locality, are important for achieving cooperation because they heighten trust that group members are willing to comply with the costs associated with collective action. Members “signal” their ethnicity and, thereby their commitment to costly moral values associated with cooperation by consuming ethnically appropriate material culture, speaking local dialects, and participating in community rituals. However, when such regions shift toward more centralized administration, multiethnic landscapes appear to pose impediments to achieving collective action at larger spatial scales. In such cases, larger more inclusive identifies are hypothesized to be an important ingredient in overcoming inter-community distrust and the unwillingness of individuals with local identities to collectively bare the costs of regional public goods and/or collective defense.

However, a growing body of scholarship on the material culture of such incorporated societies shows that the nature of their relationship with the Empire was variable, and that Inka control was not territorially continuous. One key strategy through which the Inka incorporated these groups was the entangling and capture of their local religious practices with those of the official state cult. In this paper, I propose to flip this model and ask how local polities interpreted the Inka within their own memory and history. In other words, what were the narratives that some of these polities spanned to define their own standing within the Empire? I focus on the Yauyos people from the highlands of Lima, Peru.

While imperial influence spread rapidly and thoroughly throughout the central valleys, Tlaxcallan appears as a rift in imperial control, resisting the encircling empire. Aztec narratives relegate Tlaxcallan to the peripheries, downplaying Tlaxcaltecas as one-dimensional barbaric enemies, unconquered by choice. In contrast, ethnohistoric accounts from within Tlaxcallan emphasize a state that intentionally separated itself from the Aztecs in ideology, social organization, and political and economic alliances, actively challenging the encroaching empire.

I examine these narratives through historical accounts from both northern sources and Cusco-centric writers, which serve as our primary sources of information, and compare these to archaeological data, which are mainly limited to the Cañari region. These narratives are the product of the history of Inca interactions from initial contact and conquest through the subsequent impacts of colonization, Inca civil war, and Spanish conquest, and they present attitudes toward those groups that range from indifference (Paltas) or scorn (Punaes) to respect (Cañaris). How the Incas treated these groups had impacts on how their ethnic identities were transformed or maintained during the Inca and Spanish Colonial eras, and show a pattern of consolidation of numerous smaller, related groups. Overall, the Cañaris fared best, and there are even documents revealing aspects of their own narratives of who they were during the Inca era.

While the Spanish chronicles and local ethnohistoric sources attest to these events and to the important role the local indigenous populations played in Inka colonization efforts along the eastern imperial frontier, they are all curiously silent on another important population which inhabited the eastern Andean valleys into the Inka period. Abundant archaeological evidence from the Inka site of Pulquina Arriba and surrounding settlements demonstrates that the earliest settlers of this region had arrived not from the altiplano, but instead from the eastern tropical lowlands. Further, instead of being administered by Inka elites, Pulquina Arriba seems to have been inhabited by a combination of Charkas- and lowland-affiliated peoples. As such, this seems to represent a case in which a historically unacknowledged indigenous population was nevertheless critical to the success of imperial activities and administration in a critical frontier region.

Nearly a century later, a second wave of erasures occurred when Spanish conquerors destroyed indigenous books and idols in an effort to eradicate blasphemous religious beliefs. Although indigenous accounts were eventually rewritten, largely at the hands of Spanish-educated indigenous elites, the diverse histories from Basin of Mexico polities that pre-dated the formation of the Aztec Empire remained lost.

For example, alliances, arranged marriages and ritual performances served to consolidate internal diversity and manage external challenges to the imperial façade. The historical record (a largely imperial perspective) often portrays encountered polities in subservient ways - as allies, as belligerent, as barbaric, or as the “other”. Yet, empires were invariably constrained by the actions of competing and incorporated polities, who complicated the imperial narratives through their conscious or inadvertent engagements with the empire.The papers in this session center on material evidence from recent archaeological research to challenge historical imperial narratives, and explore the spectrum of imperial influence in local material cultural expression. Specifically, we look at the Inka in the Central Andes and the Aztec in Mesoamerica.

A tendency among Mesoamericanists not to look further to the north and west, to present states such as Guanajuato and Querétaro, have thus led to the surprising oversight of the major site of El Cerrito in Querétaro. A thriving and important player of the period, El Cerrito displays iconography, sculpture and writing that is essentially indistinguishable from what is known from Tula and Chichen Itza, and the site’s largest structure, the “Basamento Piramidal” (25 m in height), is a perfect example of a radial pyramid, similar to the Temple of K’uk’ulkan at Chichen Itza.

This feature, perhaps to be associated with fire and burning, takes up its place on the nose of a different deity, Tlaloc, in Central Mexico, in the Late Postclassic. How is it that Tlaloc took on this attribute, and what did it mean in the context of the Mexica? No image of Tlaloc from Tula features the cruller: in all likelihood the cruller takes on its role in the mid-15th century, during the period of Mexica expansion. 

In this study, the iconography meaning of the twisted cord will be examined, its meaning in both Maya and Central Mexican contexts, and a possible motivation for transmission. The study will revisit the fundamental union of fire and water at the heart of Tenochtitlan, in the twinned temple of Tlaloc and Huizilopochtli.

Detailed analysis of the costumes, ceremonial responsibilities, and internal rankings of Chichen’s Itza’s fire priests reveals strong similarities to those of later Aztec fire priests as documented in painted manuscripts, stone carvings, and early colonial writings. These men, like the fire priests of Chichen Itza, dressed as the god known to the Aztecs as Tlaloc, who was the divine patron of the branch of the Aztec priesthood responsible for fire rituals. Although interesting iconographic parallels also appear at late 9th- early 10th c. Tula, whose legacy in Tenochtitlan is well documented, the Aztec priests’ physical and structural similarities to Chichen Itza are more numerous and more compelling. This suggests that the Aztecs, by some means still undetermined, were directly or indirectly drawing upon information and/or memories passed down to central Mexico from Chichen Itza.",3038,Symposium,Presenter,3038,Cecelia,Klein

Classic Maya stelae have been proposed as precursors for the Early Postclassic stelae at Tula and the relief pillars of Pyramid B at the site in previous scholarship. While suggested Maya connections for the Tula stelae are often overstated, and local central Mexican stela traditions as well as ideas from Oaxaca and Guerrero also probably contributed to the genesis of these monuments, the role of Maya contacts remains plausible. Here I explore possible Maya analogs, including stelae, for the famed atlantid columns of Pyramid B. While in style and construction these sculptures reflect the legacy of Teotihuacan, their use of elite or royal images as literal pillars has conceptual parallels in Classic Maya stelae equating kings with trees, pillars of the sky and the axis mundi. I also critically assess the possible connection, first proposed by Kubler, between the Tula atlantids and the Terminal Classic figure columns of the Puuk area. While these similarities may reflect a common Mesoamerican background rather than direct contact, recent dating of the Tula sculptural style to 650-850 CE at Tula Chico increases the probability of interaction.

The sheer cosmopolitanism of Chichen Itza makes this site an excellent point of departure for examining how stylistic and iconographic elements came to be shared at such distant sites and in similar ways. While Central Mexican influence cannot and should not be ignored, other cultural areas in the Late Classic period such as Cotzumalhuapa and Ceibal deserve renewed attention as contributors to an Early Postclassic International Style.

The visual scarcity of this crop extends into divine imagery – for instance, cacao remained an important aspect of Ek’ Chuah, the Postclassic Maya merchant god, but does not appear among the connotations of his almost-identical Mexica counterpart known as Yacatecuhtli. This disconnection between visual versus economic consumption resonates with ethnohistorical evidence of an anxiety over cacao due to its luxurious and foreign nature – and by extension the larger tensions inherent in relationships with long-distance trade goods. In this work, I examine not only what foreign goods appear in the visual vocabulary of the Mexica, but the connotations of ‘place’ in their artistic contexts. In addition, I argue that the dearth of cacao iconography reflects larger tensions. As the Mexica expanded the boundaries of their empire in search of foreign products, the imperial artistic program broadcasts a complicated narrative of a people wrestling with identity in the face of increasing connections with far-flung places.",3038,Symposium,Presenter,3038,Elliot,Lopez-Finn

As noted by Eduard Seler over a century ago, Nahua ethnohistories such as the Codex Chimalpopoca refer to the cultural region of the Maya as Tlillan Tlapallan, a land of writing and high art. In addition, archaeological evidence points to sustained artistic contact between Central Mexico and the Classic Maya kingdoms from as early as the Classic Period. While the geographic region of the Maya is famously known for its jade, cacao, rubber, copal, and tropical bird feathers, the peoples of these regions also actively participated in the borrowing and lending of artistic knowledge. This session will examine the legacy of Classic Maya art and culture within the wider cultural sphere of Mesoamerica, both in contemporary cultures and later peoples who inherited and innovated upon the complex visual artistic vocabulary established in these earlier periods.

What is the point of analyzing hundreds and thousands of small, broken pieces of pottery?  This paper explores these, and other questions, within the context of Classic Maya civilization.  Too often, it seems, ceramic analysis is used as a loose chronological framework, used solely to construct broad frameworks of relative dating.  These frameworks are then applied to archaeological assemblages, placing them within chronologically bounded “ceramic complexes” and geographically bounded “ceramic spheres.”  Then most ceramic analyses end.  This paper argues that this is the point where real ceramic analysis should begin.  Ceramic complexes should be broken down into distinct centuries and even individual decades, if possible.  Ceramic analysis can be used to create absolute chronologies.  Ceramic spheres can be subdivided, revealing the exchange of material culture between individual cities, communities, and households.  Thus, ceramic analysis can shed significant light on cultural, social, economic, and political ties on such material exchanges.

Research suggests that a “middle” status group exists. However, the social segment from which they arise is unknown.

Previous research suggested that no biological affinity existed between the ruling elite and the “middle” status groups. Thus, we hypothesized that there would be a biological connection between the “middle” status group and the nonelites at these sites. Our study used a bio-cultural approach to interpret social connections by comparing dental characteristics (crown size and trait expression) and archaeological evidence to assess whether there was biological affinity between these two social groups. Our results indicate that there was shared affinity, suggesting that middle status individuals maintained biological and cultural ties with the nonelite group.

Formal analysis of zooarchaeological materials from Fernvale took place from 2007-2012 as part of an overall effort to reassess the site assemblage. In this paper we describe findings generated by combining traditional zooarchaeological analysis with ethnohistorical research, ethnographic analogy, experimental archaeology, and use-wear analysis. By incorporating these various lines of evidence we are able not only to correct previous errors in species identification, but also to produce a contextual framework that informs our understanding of both emerging and entirely new aspects of Late Archaic lifeways.

At Lamanai, Belize, the main problem consists of distinguishing between pre- and post-Spanish contact deposits buried at a depth of 10 to 60 cm. Evidence of interaction with the Spanish includes a few European objects and two Christian churches. However, identifying pre-contact deposits is more challenging. Maya archaeologists typically rely on ceramic typology to establish chronology, but the main pottery type in use at Lamanai before Spanish arrival continued to be widely used after contact. Diachronic changes in the distribution of other archaeological correlates for pre- and post-contact assemblages, including structure features and lithics, are subtle and do not effectively demarcate deposit type. Here, I use the taphonomic study of animal remains to assess the integrity of the stratigraphic levels identified during excavations and determine whether these levels represent pre- or post-contact accumulations. The methods employed include bone counts, species composition, skeletal part distribution, refits on dry and green bone, and vertical distribution of elements. As Lamanai is one of few known locations of Maya and Spanish interactions in the southern lowlands, identifying pre- and post-contact deposits is essential for studying the impact of Spanish arrival on the Maya society.",3040,Symposium,Presenter,3040,Arianne,Boileau

In the case of the Middle Horizon (AD600-1000) contexts of Ak’awillay, new insights into the extent of trade networks and long-distance interaction are visible through the faunal record. The presence of sea lion, penguin, and coastal shell within house contexts dominated by New World camelids demonstrate that the villagers of Ak’awillay had access to long-distance exchange networks. A comparison between the public building and house contexts further reveal that these exotic species where not exclusively used and discarded in public areas but also kept within private domestic spaces.

As zooarchaeologists, we are tasked with bridging more abstract and ideational anthropological variables with the archaeological hard evidence as well as with a narrower set of more explicit zooarchaeological measures; thus, moving from heavily fragmented animal bones to complex and abstract human behaviors. A large corpus of cuneiform tablets from the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000-1750 BC) urban center of Kanesh (the archaeological site of Kültepe, Kayseri, Turkey) provide direct and indirect evidence for various aspects of agropastoral economy and offer detailed information on food ways with specific reference to animals. Thus, we have a unique opportunity to question the applicability and meaningfulness of dichotomized approaches to organization of every state or society in the ancient Near East or elsewhere. Theoretically, I focus on centralization and bureaucratic control, asymmetrical access and inequalities, and production-distribution-consumption dynamics.

Diverse types of sites were utilized by this time, including locales primarily for ritual activities. More studies of ritual site use are needed to clarify how space was organized and used during the Neolithic Transition. This paper presents evidence of animal selection and refuse management to investigate the intensity of site occupation and use of space at Kfar HaHoresh (10,600–8,700 cal. BP), the only Pre-Pottery Neolithic site in the southern Levant that served a primarily mortuary function. I employ zooarchaeological methods to assess the intensity of site occupation based on the degree of hunting pressure that humans placed on small game from the environment immediately surrounding the site. Taphonomic analysis of faunal refuse deposition is used to further illuminate the use of space, namely cleaning practices.

What began as part of the project of the Enlightenment to catalog the world based on the principles of Linnean taxonomy turned into a salvage operation to preserve vanishing traditional cultures. The objects filled the shelves of the storage rooms of museums, were more rarely seen in their exhibition halls, and almost never engaged the productive curiosity of scholars. This paper uses the Bororo and Kadiwéu cases to illustrate aspects in the history of ethnographic collecting and shows how the virtual gathering of this now widely scattered monumental corpus may at last be put to some beneficial use for new anthropological approaches and for the benefit of the source communities.",3042,Symposium,Presenter,3042,Christian,Feest

Archaeological context provides evidence of ancient Maya aggregation of disparate objects in tombs, caches, or sculptural tableaux as well as evidence of repositioning or separating things. These changes are fundamental aspects of objects’ life histories. Yet in the twentieth century, ancient monuments and object sets also have been divided -- and new sets created--whether by national museums or research institutions seeking to trade duplicates or by players in the art market hoping to increase return by splitting paired or assembled objects. Such divisions are problematic, for new assemblages often frame modern understandings of them, and evidence for original assemblage may be difficult or impossible to reconstruct. This paper thus explores the importance of considering objects not just on their own but also in relation to other pieces to which they were connected. Thinking about biographies of objects--or collective biographies-- in the past and present is a way to theorize both objects’ individual trajectories and the connections and disconnections resulting from forming or splitting pairs, sets, or other groupings.",3042,Symposium,Presenter,3042,Megan E.,O'Neil

The mead-hall in Anglo-Saxon Britain functioned as a location where social bonds were strengthened both vertically and horizontally; Vikings in Iceland relied on barley beer to demonstrate the power and generosity of chieftains. Production of alcohol in the large quantities required for feasting necessitates some degree of specialisation, but to what degree did this specialisation take on a ritual significance for the individuals involved?

Whether goods are exchanged for social, political or cultural capital, the model for examining the practice is based on a commodity framework. However, gift exchange is also a performance, often with proscribed behaviors based on the culture and the individuals participating in the exchange. This behavior clearly falls within the realm of ritual as much as that of trade or economics. In this paper I discuss gift exchange as a performed ritual both within and across cultural groups. Furthermore, while gift exchange is a behavior between individuals, it often has larger ramifications for the communities these individuals inhabit. For example, gift exchange between political leaders may influence the lives of everyone within their society. This link between social organization and gift exchange is an important aspect of its power as a ritual behavior.

Although numerous ceremonial centers of various size dotted the Irish landscape, Dún Ailinne, along with Teamhair (Tara), Emain Macha (Navan Fort), and Crúachain (Rathcroghan,) stand out due to their size and location. These characteristics indicate that the sites would have been major foci of ceremonial activity, and would have impacted the ceremonial activity itself.  Although excavations have largely focused on the sites themselves, archaeologists have long acknowledged the importance of the larger “sacred” landscape in which these major ceremonial sites are situated, postulating that their proximity, visually and physically, to other sites in the landscape would have had an important effect on the performance and experience of ritual and ceremony. As such, these landscapes are not “monolithic” entities of sacredness, but have unique developmental trajectories that may have played an important role in shaping and reflecting emerging ideas in the local community.

Imposing monuments such as Dún Ailinne, Navan Fort, and Rathcrogan have provided tantalizing glimpses into ritual and ceremonial performances of the Irish Iron Age (~500 BC-AD 500). Communal feasting has been suggested to be a key practice at these sites during the later periods of use. At feasts, social structure and identity are reinforced, wealth is redistributed, and political alliances are formed. In this way, feasts become a space for community concerns to be negotiated. The large hilltop complexes, however, are not the only ritual spaces in Iron Age Ireland. During the later prehistoric period, there is a proliferation of smaller ceremonial enclosures and barrow burials. Variation in ritual performance at these different sites provide insights into cultural concerns across different scales of society.

I argue that this case can lead to interesting questions on the archaeology of belief and ritual as well as how both can play into the archaeology of colonial entanglement and mission contexts. Focusing on an existing collection of materials from one LDS family’s household along with spatial organization and historical documentation from the broader community, I first consider the implications of ritual, belief, and practice between the individuals and the community and second, I show how this understudied context expands the discussion on belief and ritual in mission studies and recent historical archaeology.",3044,Symposium,Presenter,3044,Kaila,Akina

The regulation of ritual is a key aspect of social cohesion and status reinforcement, so what does it imply when there are variances in the performance of the ritual? Personal belief may diverge from public rituals as evidenced in burials and votive deposits, but are often included beneath the umbrella of the broader cultural norms.

Such scholars assert that alluvial settings contained fertile soils with a higher surplus potential than estuarine habitats.  Challenging this view, other scholars stress the abundance and protein values of estuarine species. We will problematize this debate through three overlapping topics. First, to what extent have disciplinary biases underemphasized coastal productivity and settlement (c.f. Erlandson and Fitzpatrick 2006)?

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Landscape Archaeology,"Abundant surface scatters of Middle Stone Age artifacts are found throughout northern Malawi, eroding from remnant alluvial fan deposits (Chitimwe Beds). Surface surveys documenting these areas have guided the emplacement of 50+ archaeological test pits and excavations, many of which have yielded in situ MSA sites.  However, the surficial evidence itself has been subject to less discussion and merits closer attention. At the Bruce site, surface artifacts were identified as part of an assemblage originally excavated in 1965, but which has since undergone significant disturbance from local development. Recent excavation and surface collecting by archaeologists has had an additional impact on the site. Bruce contrasts with localities like the similarly aged White Whale, ~40km to the south, where surface finds evidence a well-preserved knapping surface exposed by erosion near a cliff edge, that nevertheless retains spatial integrity. We use these case studies to discuss assumptions associated with surface finds, the role and influence of archaeological research on the integrity of surface and subsurface assemblages, and the relative stability of archaeological landscapes. Finally, we examine the potential for assessing landscapes modified by agrarianism—which may obscure or erase surficial archaeological materials—using declassified CORONA satellite imagery collected from 1959 to 1972.",3047,Symposium,Presenter,3047,Sheila,Nightingale

However, due to the difficulties in numerically dating them, they are usually considered as coarse indicators of past behaviors. Here, we explore the use of lithic weathering to develop local relative chronologies, and to better incorporate these assemblages into archaeological research. We test whether the most weathered artifacts should be considered the oldest; an assumption that has informally served to compare assemblages. Through macroscopic analyses, we compared seven surficial mid-to-late Holocene lithic assemblages from different micro-environments of the Atacama Desert, northern Chile. By recording changes in polish, texture, shine and color, we established that weathering varied significantly between two main locations: interfluve and canyon sites. Lithics from interfluve sites showed a dark coating and were moderately to highly weathered, whereas canyon lithics were mildly weathered and uncoated. This means that even within the hyperarid core of the Atacama, lithics of roughly the same age, are differentially weathered. We conclude that wind is the main weathering agent, mostly affecting artifacts deposited on inactive terraces or interfluves, where they remain persistently at the surface. Consequently, we stress the importance of considering taphonomic, geomorphologic and archaeological factors together when trying to establish relative chronologies.

Hence, spatial and morphological trends in the lithic record are interpreted primarily in terms of human technological behavior without a systematic assessment of unintentional and/or non-human factors as sources of variation. Surprisingly, controversies on the natural vs. anthropic character of several lithic assemblages or ‘industries’ did not prompt the adoption of taphonomic approaches by lithic analysts on a regular basis. Here I argue that archaeologist’s lack of knowledge about the effects of taphonomic mechanisms -whether natural or cultural- on stone and other knappable materials is the main obstacle towards a more comprehensive analysis of lithic assemblages. Furthermore, I propose that the study of taphonomic patterns (or background noise) in non-archaeological contexts is a mandatory task that researchers need to undertake in every region to achieve a more thorough understanding of lithic assemblage formation processes and trends. From the perspective advocated here both naturalistic and experimental constituents of actualistic taphonomic research are key to identify the agents involved in the formation of any fossil record. I present case studies from Patagonia (Southern South America) to illustrate the main contributions of lithic taphonomy to assess pseudoartifact components in the surface record.",3047,Symposium,Presenter,3047,Karen,Borrazzo

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Landscape Archaeology,"During the past two decades Paleolithic research in Serbia has rapidly expanded with numerous cave sites currently under excavation. However, this focus on caves in largely upland terrain may create a biased understanding of the Paleolithic record. Typically, open-air sites are integrated into research projects to correct for this bias. Unfortunately, Serbia has very few open-air sites, requiring us to use other sources of evidence as proxies for understanding the Paleolithic record in lowland areas. One underutilized source of data is Lithic Surface Scatters.  
This presentation describes the Paleolithic surface material gathered from Pleistocene river terraces in Serbia and how researchers are using it to understand the Paleolithic record in the country outside of cave contexts. In addition to identifying the typological and technological affinities of these artifacts, I will also assess whether the presence (or absence) of surface material in different regions of Serbia is the result of taphonomic factors, differential landform preservation or survey selection bias.",3047,Symposium,Presenter,3047,Eric,Heffter

",Paleolithic,Digital Archaeology: GIS,Landscape Archaeology,"Lithic surface scatters comprise a large proportion of the archaeological record but their value for understanding human behavior is often doubted. Modern geomorphological processes often laterally displace and selectively bias surface assemblages of artifacts. The predictable effects of displacement on the condition, weathering and size distributions of lithic assemblages is better understood. While topography is known to play a role in this process, the degree to which topographic variables contribute to the taphonomy of surface assemblages is understudied. Understanding how topography influences the displacement and taphonomy of surface assemblages provides a potential avenue for assessing the extent to which surface assemblages reflect past human discard patterns. We use digital terrain analysis to investigate the influence of topography on the formation of surface lithic assemblages. The modern geomorphology and topography of the lithic landscapes from the Koobi Fora Formation (Kenya) are characterized by digital elevation models obtained from unmanned aerial systems.  Spatial analysis is used to assess the relationship between the modern landscape and taphonomic attributes of surface assemblages. A discussion of the efficacy of this approach for assessing the integrity of surface assemblages is presented.

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Mobility,"Large scale surface surveys represent singular insights into the landscape scale variation in behaviors. Detailed investigations of the spatial distribution of artifacts across large spatial extents allow archaeologists to investigate a landscape as a single site. Surface assemblages have the advantage of large sample sizes and large aerial extents. However, biases associated with the formation processes of surface assemblages often undermine our confidence in the behavioral inferences derived from these records. Here we investigate patterns of behavior recorded in several whole assemblage behavioral indicators for seven assemblages recovered from the Acheulean dunefield site of Elandsfontein (800 ka -1 Ma) from the Western Cape in South Africa. Large surface and excavated assemblages of stone artifacts from similar locations allow us to investigate the impact of deflation processes on behavioral inferences. We use agent based models to develop expectations about the spatial variation in behaviors across this ancient landscape. Results suggest that the processes that created deflated surface assemblages have varied impacts on whole assemblage behavioral indicators. Some of these proxies of behavior appear to provide faithful representations of patterns derived from excavated assemblages. We compare these behavioral inferences to contextual data collected from excavated contexts.

Relying on data from the archaeological record, primarily radiocarbon dates, variation in cemetery structure, mound location, and material culture, we address this issue. Possible explanations range from the simple, depopulation and regional cultural discontinuity, to nuanced, complex interpretations of funerary activities and interment facilities from throughout the Middle and Late Woodland periods.

At times during high water stands in the basin the location was the entrepot to the system from Lake Huron, and during later recessional episodes became the first highly visible landform encountered in upstream travel.  The “mound” was employed for ritual purposes and cumulative mortuary behaviors for 5000 years. As recently as the late 18th century it harbored a Native American cemetery, and during the early 19th century it continued its prominent role of place as the site of major treaty negotiations. Such continuity of use reifies its status as a persistent place with attached and transmitted intergenerational information, and potentially transcending specific named ethnic/tribal groups; it is a cumulative historical space.

Second, just 10% of the core residential area has been excavated and far less than 10% of the entire site has been studied. To gain large-scale spatial control over ancient and modern subsurface disturbances across the site, the authors undertook a comprehensive magnetic gradient survey of the entire palisaded portion of the site.

Previous experimental attempts at photogrammetry at Pacbitun were implemented in an ad-hoc manner to serve as a proof of concept for the inclusion of 3D photogrammetry in the program of research at Pacbitun. Spatial control of the acquired models was similarly ad hoc, utilizing the tools available at that time. The resultant 3D models from the 2015 and 2016 campaigns have proven a highly effective tool for the visualization of excavations conducted during those field seasons.  
This presentation marks the maturation of 3D photogrammetry at Pacbitun. The integration of 3D data with differential GPS positional data allows for data processed using photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques to be integrated into existing GIS data. By acquiring images in a rule-based manner, the overall number of images can be optimized to balance between number of images needed and photogrammetric coverage. Reducing the overall number of images while maximizing coverage will allow for models to be produced more efficiently, and with great overall accuracy. Improved spatial control, updated software and enhanced image acquisition techniques have allowed photogrammetry at Pacbitun to mature from an experiment to a critical recordation tool.

This group, designated as the Tzib Group, was targeted because one of the mounds, labelled Mano Mound, yielded numerous mano fragments on its surface. Intensive investigations at Mano Mound revealed a production loci, namely the manufacture of manos made from granite, dating to the Late Classic (600-800 CE) period. Systematic survey immediately around the Tzib Group has produced numerous other small groups of mounds also engaged in mano production. Until the summer of 2017 we believed that this mano producing community was limited to the northwest periphery of the site core.

These investigations have probed into plaza floors, residential and ceremonial platforms, as well as burials. The resulting conclusions have demonstrated a relatively narrow use of animals at the site as food resources but exemplify a significant use of freshwater and marine faunal resources, with evidence for the widespread use of the latter as raw material for Preclassic shell bead production. We offer varying interpretations for the substantial amounts of freshwater jute shells found at the site and discuss Pacbitun’s role in long distance exchange networks to procure marine faunal resources.

Sacred landscapes, for example, inspire social narratives regarding how people should interact with the environment. Components of those landscapes, such as caves and mountains, become active participants in the establishment, maintenance, and mobilization of environmental narratives. They serve as hegemonic tools for conveying morality and proper behavior, and as such they are prone to appropriation by those in power. Using archaeological data from the Maya site of Pacbitun, this paper seeks to understand how materialized narratives are part of broader networks of power used to reinforce and challenge dominant hegemony. The presence of elite-sponsored constructions near caves act as overt manifestations of environmental narratives seeking to situate the community as a unified whole. Yet, studying ritually deposited offerings in Pacbitun’s caves reveals differences in ceremonial practice.

But not all memories are treated the same or are even chosen to be remembered. My own experiences as an archaeologist living in a modest-sized, rust-belt city for nearly two decades has exposed the never-ending rush of “progress” to erase the past. At both my research sites and my home, I see communities harmed by the trauma of forced erasure of the past – forced forgetting. As landmarks, parks, homesteads, and factories that were once the backdrop of many people’s lives are destroyed, communities experience the disorientation and dislocation of memory. The demolition of the past is usually coated with a veneer of newness and the promise of better times ahead. But what trauma becomes embedded in the landscape once communities lose their physical connection to their past and their identities?  What burdens are placed on those who are left to do the work of remembering? I propose that “traumascapes” are created in the violence of gentrification.

Often missed by those without proper training, archaeologists recover mundane objects (plates, cups, etc.) and use them to speak about grand social issues (past peoples have left lessons for us). These parallels are not uncanny, they are noteworthy. By investigating how and why a space takes on the aura of a haunted place, archaeology can tap into the enthusiasm for the past that ghost hunters/tourists espouse.

Archaeologists have often explained human responses to these increasingly aquatic environment as in terms of an increasing reliance on fisher-hunter-gatherer economies. Similarly, once the AHP ended, humans abandoned these lifeways. These perspectives are overly deterministic; in this paper, we approach this problem by adapting a Resilience Theory framework to examine a (type site?) case-site on the Lothagam-Lokam site near Lake Turkana, Kenya. New excavations at Lothagam-Lokam have uncovered a sequence of small-scale local environmental shifts with interstratified cultural horizons that spans the entire Holocene. We argue that people’s decisions to intensify or re-organize their economic strategies shaped their options and cultural attitudes in responding to subsequent stresses when faced with small-scale environmental fluctuations around Turkana. The interconnected cultural and economic systems gradually assembled through multiple resilience cycles ultimately conditioned responses to more extreme events such as the 60 m drop in Turkana’s lake level at the end of the AHP. Our application of Resilience Theory at Lokam provides a potential path forward for more nuanced discussions of human-environment interactions during the AHP.",3055,Symposium,Presenter,3055,Steven,Goldstein

Increasing aridity ca. 6,000-5,000 BP encouraged early herders to migrate south into the region, while local hunter-gatherers intensified their reliance on ecologically-rich environments. Kansyore hunter-gatherers of the Lake Victoria basin established specialized subsistence systems that incorporated heavy pottery-use and seasonal site occupation at this time, possibly in response to decreasing rainfall. A gap in the archaeological record, however, limits understandings of Kansyore strategies in relation to environmental reorganization. Evidence from western Kenya suggests Early (~8,000-6,000 BP) and Late phase occupations (~3,500-1,500 BP) associated with changes in the frequency of pottery production/use, ceramic style, and fishing strategies, yet no evidence exists for Kansyore activities between these periods. Recent excavations at Namundiri A in eastern Uganda reveal a long archaeological sequence without breaks in the stratigraphic or material record. Faunal and ceramic data shows clear patterns of subsistence change similar to those observed between the Early and Late Kansyore, suggesting that this Kansyore “gap” is the result of incomplete radiometric data and a dearth of targeted research in the region, rather than a break in occupation during the mid-Holocene.",3055,Symposium,Presenter,3055,Mica,Jones

In addition to Bayira, Mota Cave contains a diverse lithic assemblage, as well as the onset of pottery. The cave has revealed evidence for the beginning of food production in the region. Fauna and flora remains suggest that agropastoralism began over the last two millennia. The excavations suggest that Mota Cave was utilized for a variety of purposes from a mortuary site to a living site to a place to seek refuge in times of conflict.

This paper explores two key questions: 1) can we identify archaeological evidence for hunter-gatherer activities in this region during the early AHP ~15-12 ka; and 2) if so are there technological, settlement, dietary and other behavioral changes that can be linked to climatic change or other possible causal mechanisms? A preliminary review of the early AHP archaeological record shows that despite a small data set and a limited number of chronometric ages, there appears to be few sites in the Nile Valley, while in eastern Africa there are substantially more.

The relationship of environmental change to human social and territorial organization adaptations are fairly well-documented in northern, eastern and southern Africa. However, the Holocene terrestrial record of environmental change in east-central Africa is poorly documented. Stable carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotope analyses of human bones and teeth from northern Malawi suggest that hunter-gatherers exploited humid closed woodlands during the AHP (low 13C, low 15N), drier more open habitats during the MHDP (higher 13C, very high 15N), and relatively closed, humid woodlands during the later Holocene (low 13C, low 15N). Iron Age peoples consumed substantial amounts C4 plants (high 13C, low 15N). Strontium isotope data for small subset of these skeletons are insufficient to reconstruct residential life histories.

",Bronze Age,Digital Archaeology,Material Culture and Technology,"Formal approaches to rock art traditionally focused on meaning and representation. Rock art images and panels were treated as static representations of symbolic frameworks while their materiality and active role in cultural production were overlooked. Rock art is the product of the dynamic interplay between people, tools and the rock surface. The properties of the rock panel have the capacity to shape rock art production as much as the skill and knowledge held by the engraver/painter and the social context in which these engagements take place. Furthermore, rock art panels may accrue complex biographies via multiple engagements.
I combine a relational-biographical approach with digital imaging technologies (e.g. RTI) to the study of rock art carvings as a way forward to address these questions. By focusing on the biographies of Iberian warrior stelae (how they were made, reworked, etc.), relevant details emerge: despite iconographic standardisation there is variability in the techniques and procedures deployed which are linked to the interplay between the stone, the skill of the carver and her/his knowledge of local rock art traditions; stelae can be reworked at later stages and reused in a variety of ways, opening up a debate about the temporality of rock art traditions.",3057,Symposium,Presenter,3057,Marta,Diaz-Guardamino

",Other,Other,Landscape Archaeology,"This paper approaches Silk Road-scapes as imagined topographies, a particular inheritance of the medieval culture of travel, and of its representations of the world(s). How we imagine ‘Silk Road’ landscape is therefore rooted in assumptions about categories and conditions of agency (social and historical), and about space. These include mobility, transcendence, and visibility—both in the landscape and in the record. Travel and cosmopolitan encounters along roads (Silk or otherwise) are chrono-topoi (spacetimes) which structure our historically-situated regard of spaces, such as mountain valleys and expansive deserts. 
Working in local landscapes of medieval Armenia, I problematize the idea of Silk Road space, thinking not only about mobility and contact, but also about spaces of care, hospitality, and comfort. Critical to the theme of this session, these spaces and practices are gendered, embodied, they depend on vulnerable spacetimes and ‘quotidian’ actors, as well as particular ideas of ‘culture’ and ‘nature.’ In this paper I will explore how picking at the gendered structuring of Silk Road narratives both requires that we deploy archaeological data in different ways, and also leads to larger-scale untanglings of understandings about large-scale exchange, culture ‘contact’ and the distinctions between pre-modern and modern worlds.

The physical act of placing a body into the ground is a place-making practice, a performative act, and, in the process, the place becomes gendered. This has been true since the origins of burial practices in the human lineage, dating to at least the early Upper Paleolithic, and perhaps earlier. This paper is a preliminary attempt to look back at the European Upper Paleolithic burial record to examine these burials as queer spaces, and as a place for queer identity construction, reconstruction, and negotiation. The Upper Paleolithic has a severely limited number of burials, and thus these burial places – both cave or rockshelter and open-air contexts - and the individuals contained within them, can be considered queer, different, and non-normative. The queer nature of the embodied identities of these burials and their location has been hereto unexplored.

These settlements were intimately associated with rundale farming, a system of cooperative or collective agriculture. This system was a sophisticated response to specific ecological conditions. Lands within infields, outfields, and commonage were allocated so that each household received a proportionate share of productive and non-productive land. Thus, each community was highly adapted to its unique environmental niche. These settlements were also highly complex social organisms. Children kept cattle away from the gardens, cut and planted potatoes, and gleaned fields where grains were harvested. Women provided for the children, carded and spun wool, and tended to the household. Men were responsible for the management of farm lands. Thus, activity within each clachan and rundale was shaped by gender and age. Although maligned as ‘backwards’ and ‘primitive,’ clachans were in fact well-orchestrated socio-economic systems that distributed the risk of agricultural production among its members.

Traditionally, researchers have modelled the origins of Moundville within a political-economic lens: the growing aspirations of elites, who are implied to be male, are supported and fueled by stores of and feasts of maize, which is treated primarily as a resource to achieve their ambitions. However, through a careful analysis of the early landscape of practice of the hominy foodway of the Black Warrior Valley, I suggest that during this early period, it was not the activities of men, but instead those of new and endemic women to the area that first sparked and then united the early Moundville landscape. This analysis further suggests that what has largely been interpreted as a homogenous cultural expression for all people regardless of gender within the area was instead more heavily driven by, and had a greater impact on, female gendered activities.

Studies of the region’s earliest ceramics of the Formative period have been almost completely ignored.  The earliest ceramics made in the region tend to be much coarser than the later serving wares, so we cannot use the existing reference databases to source them.  Here we build the Formative reference database with a large sample of chemical and petrographic data generated from the earliest ceramics found in the Basin of Mexico, the Teotihuacan Valley, the Toluca Valley, western Puebla, Tlaxcala, southern Hidalgo, and eastern Morelos.  We add Formative ceramics opportunistically sampled from the Soconusco, the Tehuacán Valley, and Pánuco in northern Veracruz for comparison.  While the objectives of this study were not intended to highlight long-distance exchange, both regional and interregional trade of ceramics were identified.  These patterns of interaction were key in producing the interregional style horizons that developed during the Early and Middle Formative periods in Mesoamerica.",3060,Symposium,Presenter,3060,Wesley,Stoner

Yet their urbanization process remains poorly understood. Our research over the last six field seasons indicates that some residential groups were settled at Tlalancaleca towards 800 BC and the settlement was urbanized with a significant population growth during the later Middle Formative period (ca. 650-500 BC); the city experienced large-scale urban transformations during the Late Formative (ca. 500-100 BC) and a subsequent and final urban expansion during the Terminal Formative (ca. 100 BC-AD 250). Tlalancaleca’s long occupational history overlaps with that of Chalcatzingo as well as Teotihuacan and, thus, provides a unique opportunity to address long-term social transformations during the Formative period. Based on preliminary results of our research at Tlalancaleca, we will reconsider the trajectory of urban transformations in Central Mexico over 1000 years from the Middle Formative to the Terminal Formative/Early Classic periods and discuss its implications for understanding parallel and divergent trajectories of social transformation in later Formative Mesoamerica.",3060,Symposium,Presenter,3060,Tatsuya,Murakami

In previous papers, I have presented stylistic evidence for interaction between La Consentida and potters from distant West Mexican traditions such as Capacha and Opeño. While some of La Consentida’s decorated Tlacuache phase vessels suggest involvement in a system of long-distance interaction along Mesoamerica’s Pacific coast, more utilitarian wares such as globular jars and undecorated hemispherical bowls imply affiliations closer to home, specifically with Early Formative period highland assemblages of the Espiridión, Tierras Largas, and Purrón phases. In this paper, I discuss formal similarities between highland pottery and La Consentida’s Tlacuache phase assemblage. On the basis of these affiliations, I propose a model in which La Consentida’s diverse ceramics are explained as partly the result of the cooperating or even conflicting emphases of overlapping interaction spheres: one along the Pacific coast and one tying the coast to the southern and central Mesoamerican highlands. These patterns suggest that people at La Consentida both maintained some traditional practices of Red-on-Buff potters in adjacent regions and self-consciously participated in a coastal interaction network involving more superficial decorative styles.",3060,Symposium,Presenter,3060,Guy,Hepp

This paper presents preliminary results of excavations, which were carried at monumental structures at Tlalancaleca. It examines the construction techniques used for monument building (including talud-tablero facades), the degree of urban planning, and the temporal relationship between monumental construction and the urban development based on new radiocarbon dates. Preliminary analysis suggests that monumental construction and reconstruction was heightened during the Terminal Formative period and was associated with urban expansion after the eruption of Popocatepetl around AD 50. While there was no central avenue at Tlalancaleca, we have noted a certain degree of standardization of main axes for monumental building.

The decades before our era underwent both socio-spatial reconfigurations, probably due to rapid environmental change in the principal cultural epicenter, the valley of Acambaro, which was massively depopulated. The synchronicity of these evolutions with the events that took place in the Basin of Mexico or the regions of Puebla Tlaxacala is particularly striking.  The recent works carried out in two zones of the Lerma region, the valley of Acambaro itself, and the alluvial plain of Lerma some 100 km downstream, lead to revisit the current assumptions on the directions of population movements that signal the end of Chupicuaro and which mark the beginning of new processes embodied by Protoclassic societies in north-central Mexico.

While we do not imply that the presence or absence of certain ceramic traditions serves as direct indicators for political control, it is likely that Tlalancaleca formed part of important interaction spheres along with other areas such as the Morelos region, the Tehuacan Valley, the Basin of Mexico, and more lately with the Valley of Teotihuacan. Some ceramics resembling those from the Patlachique-Tzacualli tradition at Teotihuacan, which were formerly seen as foreign and brought after the abandonment of Tlalancaleca around 100 A.D., have been obtained from secure contexts in recent excavations of monumental architecture at Tlalancaleca.

In the village of Tetimpa, some beverage was fitting for the last journey, since several of over a hundred burials have goblets. Their content is unknown, but as each house had, besides ollas for water, amphorae similar to those later used in Cholula for pulque, it might have been this or another fermented brew.

These institutions were motivated to both understand the prehistory of the Northeast, and to build large museum collections for comparative and public engagement purposes. The drive to acquire largely intact objects led to the excavation of many graves throughout New England and the Maritime Provinces, but the frequent discovery of graves in Eastern Massachusetts due to urban expansion led to their heavy representation within the literature. A large body of incised ceramic vessels from grave contexts thus entered institutional collections during this period, and formed the core of what scholars and avocationalists used to define Protohistoric ceramic technology. This paper seeks to evaluate the persistence of these chronologies in the twentieth century, address later research which demonstrates the inappropriateness of applying these chronologies to much of the Far Northeast due to the contemporaneous use of cord impressed ceramics in areas of Maine and the Maritimes, and to serve as a starting point for future research concerning ceramic diversity in the Protohistoric Far Northeast.",3061,Symposium,Presenter,3061,Trevor,Lamb

Persistent places like bedrock lithic sources may shape human movement; however, patterning in the distribution of stone tools may provide more than just settlement and exchange information.

WMCC is a ubiquitous stone tool material found throughout the LSJR sub-region during the Maritime Woodland Period (ca. 3000-500 BP) and appears as a (presumably) traded material in assemblages outside of the LSJR. Thus, the location of the bedrock source may have facilitated social interaction between different ethnic groups.

The study of human mobility is key to understanding the social and cultural dynamics of the pre-Columbian groups that inhabited northern Chile’s Atacama Desert. Material culture suggests that during the Late Intermediate Period (AD 900-1450) individuals frequently crossed the desert from the coast to the Andes and vice versa. Fish remains have been found in the interior valleys, and inland textiles and crops at the coast. This paper explores mobility in northern Chile through the application of strontium and oxygen isotope analyses on human teeth from several archaeological sites. First we present a local bioavailable strontium baseline for the study area, based on plant and animal remains, which helps to alleviate the scarcity of bio-available strontium isotope data for northern Chile. Results show that non-local individuals of both sexes were buried in the dispersed cemeteries of Pica 8, Quitor 6 and Los Verdes 1. These results support the idea that varied groups of individuals moved across the landscape, complementing and augmenting the larger discussion on mobility patterns in the Atacama Desert.

This is especially true for the Andes, where the “thorny oyster” has been found far afield from its tropical breeding sites along the coasts of Ecuador and northern Peru. However, factors such as the uneven development of archaeology between Peru and Ecuador and the persistence of certain myths about Andean Spondylus have led to a “black-boxing” effect where exchange from Ecuador to Peru is assumed rather than tested.
This paper briefly presents the state of understanding in Andean Spondylus, as relates to: its exploitation by ancient people; its exchange through the coast, highlands, and jungle; its production into remarkable artifacts of beauty and importance; and its cosmological significance for numerous Andean societies. This review highlights the potential impact of developing techniques to source Spondylus shells from their coastal Ecuadorian and Peruvian breeding grounds on the study of the ancient Andes.

Here, I examine intensified camelid pastoral systems as an adaptation to scarcity in the Andean highlands. I employ a multiproxy analysis including zooarchaeology, microbotany, and stable isotopes to examine the extent to which intensified pastoralism was key in proliferating the widespread cultural phenomena we see in the highlands at approximately 1000BC in the Central Andes.

I then explore some of the current institutional factors (many of them legacies of the discipline’s trajectory) that either inhibit or fail to actively encourage collaborative archaeological practice in Greece. For archaeological projects supported by U.S. academic institutions, these include the academic position of Greek archaeology within Classics departments and the dismissal of Modern Greek as a legitimate field of study for Classical archaeologists. Finally, I suggest potential future directions for engaged archaeologies of Greece that directly confront this disciplinary legacy.

Is it possible to practice engaged and ethical research in these contexts, and if so, what practical accommodations can we reach—or must we abandon the project altogether?
 
This paper investigates these questions in the context of post-genocide Rwanda, where social science research has become increasingly constrained. Some researchers have found themselves on semi-official “enemies lists”, while others encounter pressure to be “friends of Rwanda” who can be counted on to produce complimentary accounts of the country. Drawing on my experiences as a heritage ethnographer in Rwanda, I examine the ethical and practical difficulties of conducting research under the eye of a powerful and sensitive government, and negotiating responsibilities both to communities and to scholarship itself. ",3064,Symposium,Presenter,3064,Annalisa,Bolin

",Other,Other,Theory,"Fore fronting that “decolonization is not a metaphor” (Tuck and Yang
2012), this paper demonstrates how decolonization is not just an
historical process but rather an action that is political at its core. As
global efforts to redefine archaeological practice are underway to ensure
a more just and equitable practice, political historiographies of colonial
archaeology in high income postcolonies, such as the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), must also be investigated. Epistemic violence embedded within
colonial archaeology maintains itself under the guise of ‘science,’ as
archaeology continues to make demands upon bodies, landscapes, memories,
histories, and heritage.

This paper investigates what refusing to work in inequitable conditions
might look like and what sorts of alternative pathways exist for an
equitable and decolonized archaeological praxis. This will include
entering archaeology (as a discipline) into transdisciplinary dialog with
contemporary art and design. Engagement is not limited to a human to human
interaction but rather, this paper will consider conceptual engagement as
a key facet to epistemic rearrangements. Utilizing over five years of work
with collaborators in the UAE, in this paper I will provide multiple
formats through which ethical praxis emerged within frameworks of critical
pedagogy, public engagement and archaeological practice.",3064,Symposium,Presenter,3064,Uzma,Rizvi

At the same time, archaeology is recognized as a powerful tool by governments, organizations, and communities around the world. Many of these groups seek to use archaeology for their own political purposes: to justify nationalism, to legitimize seizures of territory, and to assert certain historical narratives and rights. An archaeologist’s commitment to engaged, ethical archaeology may prepare them to grapple with manifestations of colonialism and privilege, but what happens when that very ethics requires them to push back against the groups they hope to engage? How do archaeologists negotiate the practical issues that arise out of conflicting needs and desires by various stakeholders? This session explores how an ethics of engaged archaeology intersects with the dynamics of contemporary politics. In an age of rising, insular nationalism, “engagement” and “reflexivity” are insufficient guidelines when the archaeologist is situated within shifting and cross-cutting political dynamics.

To address this gap for archaeology and other social sciences, in 2016 the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) undertook an effort to engage four underrepresented social science disciplines to support preparation of the fourth US National Climate Assessment and other ongoing federal work.

Instead, we argue that discussions need to bring together all the social and natural aspects that people tend to abstract as separate; to see capitalism as an internally related dynamic totality. The unforeseen consequences of an ever-expanding economy built on the accumulation of wealth is that one of its “products” is the concentration of toxic gases that have contributed to global climate change.

Evidence for intensive blade production coincides with pollen evidence from Cobweb Swamp for economic species such as maize and manioc. 
     During the Archaic Period, a warmer, wetter environment jumpstarts an archaeologically visible trend in cultivation and domestication. Mesoamerica’s biologically diverse landscape had much to offer its early revolutionary inhabitants. Research involving the cultural transition from complex hunter-gatherers to agriculturalists supports evidence that the early inhabitants of Colha can be studied as a regional model to understand their larger role during the commencement of the Maya civilization.

Such palimpsests become potent, which, in the case of mortuary landscapes, can manifest in increasingly complex burial rituals through time. The 2017 excavations at Colha revealed a series of 9 interments in the main plaza of the 2000 sector, yielding a minimum number of 13 individuals. This mortuary area initially utilized during the Middle Preclassic was reused during the Late Preclassic, with some later interments cutting into those of the preceding period, as suggested by associated practices and material accoutrements. Zooarchaeological evidence indicates that although certain taxa, including deer, were exploited throughout the entire temporal span, others, specifically ichthyofauna, are characteristic of Late Classic mortuary contexts. The placement of elements from this taxonomic group within vessel burials alongside commingled human individuals is associated with the elaboration of mortuary practices more broadly, which includes complex secondary depositions and increasingly specialized craft production of grave goods.

This low-lying area, known locally as the Cobweb depression, encompasses a complex wetland system that is affected by Holocene sea level rise, human-induced vegetation changes, and both natural and anthropogenic erosional sequences. The dynamic landscape, coupled with a long history of human occupation, places this site in a complex geographic and cultural position within the greater Maya Lowlands. This paper focuses on the interplay between natural soil formation sequences, the built environment, and the temporal changes in resource extraction and utilization within the Colha core. Here, we specifically build upon previous research on soils and sediments of the greater Cobweb Swamp depression and how these soils form onsite. Accelerator Mass  Spectrometry (AMS) dating, Magnetic Susceptibility, and Loss On Ignition methodologies are employed to further characterize the present soils and geologic resources. Geochemical and elemental techniques are applied to lime plaster samples in order to determine sourcing and production during Preclassic occupation. The data proffered from these analyses highlight the unique geologic context of Colha,  demonstrate how these environmental resources were manipulated, and supplement broader work on local human-landscape interactions.",3068,Symposium,Presenter,3068,Anastasia,Kotsoglou

The site is bisected northwest to southeast by the Old Northern Highway, and further bisected perpendicularly by Rancho Creek. Cobweb Swamp lines the eastern boundaries of the site. Colha is located within the northern portion of the northern Belize chert-bearing zone. It is well-known for being one of the largest Maya lithic production sites with hundreds of chert workshops for the production of tools including adzes, celts, and stemmed blades. The site has occupation dating to the Archaic Period as well as the 
Middle Preclassic through the Early Postclassic.

The objective of the 2017 field season centered around fine tuning the chronology of the earlier occupation periods for the site during the Archaic and Middle Preclassic Periods, as well as investigations surrounding human environmental interaction during a critical cultural transition. Targeted excavations within the 4000 sector and the 2000 sector are the focal points of this session. An overview of excavation strategies and history of the site will lead into papers discussing preliminary analysis of burials, lithics, ceramics, faunal remains, paleoethnobotanical finds, and other analytical research.",3068,Symposium,Chair (Primary),3068,Luisa,Aebersold

",Intermediate Area,Ceramic Analysis,Mobility,"Mobility, as it relates to censers, can be discussed on both large and small scales; it includes the movement of iconographic concepts, the physical objects, and the material or organics burned inside the censer. Censers styles fluctuate across pre-Columbian time due to a wide variety of reasons, though the purpose remains the same, which is to burn incense. The singular function of censers makes it an exemplary artefact class for the discussion of mobility across geographical and cultural regions. Here, I draw upon multiple regions to show the continuity of certain design elements across the different cultural regions and time periods. This discussion draws particular attention to the occurrences of the spiked vessel style of censers and the periods of use as they have the strongest iconographical botanical connections. Spiked vessel comparative studies are not new to Mesoamerica and the Maya region; here I continue the discussion further into southern Central America. It is hoped that the macro scale discussion will provide further understanding to the nuances of Potosí Applique from Greater Nicoya.",3070,Symposium,Presenter,3070,Lorelei,Platz

",Intermediate Area,Ethnohistory/History,Migration,"Ethnoshitorical sources describe migrations from central Mexico of Nahuat and Mangue speakers, known as the Pipil/Nicarao and the Chorotega, who settled along the Pacific Coast of Central America in the centuries prior to European contact. According to these accounts the new groups introduced cultural and religious traits into settlements in El Salvador, the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, and northwestern Costa Rica. Beginning in 2000, archaeologists from the University of Calgary have investigated various sites along the shore of Lake Cocibolca, searching for evidence of migration and colonization of the region. Based on these intensive excavations we have NOT identified evidence of the Pipil/Nicarao, and characteristics of the Chorotega are enigmatic at best. Although innovative features do appear beginning about AD 700, particularly in terms of polychrome ceramics and mortuary patterns, the evidence supports only limited Mexican contact but with more interaction with greater Central America. This paper will present excavated data to critique the historical sources, with the conclusion that the historical myths are not reliable chronicles for interpreting pre-Columbian migrations.",3070,Symposium,Presenter,3070,Geoffrey,McCafferty

",Other,Cultural Resources and Heritage Management,Mobility,"To paraphrase the symposium organizers, for decades changes in the pre-Columbian material culture of Central America were attributed to either migration or conquest. When I began archaeological research in Costa Rica in 1969 the endless debate was about Mesoamerican influence. Technological and iconographic linkages were frequently cited, but rarely were the mechanisms of the proposed linkages adequately defined or demonstrated archaeologically. In 2008, perhaps unduly influenced by having moved to California in 2004, I floated the concept of a “southern Mesoamerican Wedge” a la Kroeber. This wedge paralleled the Pacific coast and while the Paleo and Archaic periods were almost invisible, by the early Preclassic almost identical ceramics are found in the Soconusco, beneath downtown Managua, and in the Arenal region of Costa Rica. And, in a pattern even more complicated than was ever described for the Takic Wedge, the southern Mesoamerican Wedge is also intersected throughout Central America with river drainages that for all intent and purpose connected the Caribbean with the Pacific and low, natural “roads” or “saddles” between the volcanoes that accomplished the same objective. Investigating these complex adaptations, particularly involving groups of differing linguistic or ethnic backgrounds, requires new research designs and multi-country research.",3070,Symposium,Presenter,3070,Frederick,Lange

It originates from Fisher’s model for the diffusion of advantageous alleles across the landscape, but was then applied in archaeology to the diffusion of agriculture from the Near East into Europe. More recently, Lévy flights, which are random walks with step lengths derived from power-law distributions, have been proposed as models for human movement, especially for foragers. The archaeological signatures for these two dynamical processes—Brownian motion versus Lévy flights—are potentially quite different, making them useful and practical to consider. It seems likely prima facie that both processes are good models for different kinds of prehistoric migrations, and, moreover, in each case tuning the parameters of the model yields different patterns. In this paper, I discuss historical and archaeological evidence for these two different dynamical regimes of migration models and their implications for our interpretations.",3070,Symposium,Presenter,3070,Clifford,Brown

",Intermediate Area,Ceramic Analysis,Identity/Ethnicity,"Ethnohistoric and colonial documents typically focus on detailing a socioeconomic and political landscape dominated by Chorotega and Nicarao groups for contact-period Pacific Nicaragua. Yet these texts simultaneously indicate that other groups living in isolated communities or urban barrios were also commonplace and included Maribios, Mazatec, Chondal, Matagalpans, Sumo-Ulwa, and possibly Lenca and/or Maya-speaking peoples, among others. As archaeologists, we are aware—many of us dutifully placing the convoluted language distribution map in our culture history write-ups. Despite this, most of these groups are not factored into theoretical discussions and are rarely, if ever, seriously discussed as part of the region’s archaeological past. Instead, a three-phase linear trajectory (Chibchan-Chorotega-Nicarao) premised on ‘great’ migration events ending in regional domination by foreigners and their intrusive material monoculture has been the interpretive norm. This inconsistency begs the questions: Do we really believe complex multicultural lifeways magically appeared with or immediately before the Spaniards? And if multicultural lifeways were a pre-Columbian norm in this area, as complex social organization at contact suggests, why can’t we see those other groups in the record? Using Sapoá-period (AD 800-1250) ceramics as a case study, this paper explores whether the assemblage represents ‘Chorotega monoculture’ or a complex multicultural aggregate.",3070,Symposium,Presenter,3070,Carrie,Dennett

Quelepa was restructured from what was likely a Lenca foundation to reflect possibly invasive Veracruz tastes, yet some Lenca elements were retained. Did both Lenca and Veracruz immigrants live together peacefully? What can art and architecture tell us of this possible merger, an instance of multiculturalism? Farther south in the highlands of Caribbean Costa Rica, the site of Guayabo de Turrialba was sculpted in the image of Colombian cities farther to the south or possibly vice versa. Yet Guayabo art retains traits of what is likely deep-seated ancient Huetar culture in this region, newly blended with Tairona styles.

",Intermediate Area,Iconography and Epigraphy,Iconography and Art,"Pacific Nicaragua has long been noted as a cultural crossroads, especially featuring historically documented migrants from central Mexico. Following ethnohistorical accounts, Nahuat speaking groups colonized the Rivas area in the Late Postclassic Ometepe period.  The most prominent diagnostic ceramic of this time was Luna Polychrome, often found in mortuary contexts. This paper presents a detailed analysis of over 50 Luna vessels from the Mi Museo collection. The overarching theme of the painted designs relates to the Praying Mantis. This interpretation coincides with oral traditions relating the mantis as the “Madre Culebra”, a powerful and revered predator of the insect world and closely affiliated with female symbolic authority. The association of these vessels with mortuary ritual suggest links to the Nahuat deity Cihuacoatl, a goddess of death and regeneration, whose name also translates as ‘woman serpent’.",3070,Symposium,Presenter,3070,Sharisse,McCafferty

Normal diffusion is seen in the Department of Chinandega through the ceramics of the early facet of the Late Preclassic Cosigüina complex, which derive from the Providencia Sphere. This ceramic sphere originates from the southern highlands of Guatemala and western El Salvador and now extends at least to northwest Nicaragua. The evidence of superdiffusion lies with a type known as Delirio Red-on-white, which is found at scattered sites in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. We argue that its patchy and discontinuous distribution is evidence for superdiffusion because, as we show through design analysis and comparison of forms and pastes, Delirio is related to Coyotlatelcto types from Late Classic Central Mexico. We suggest that Delirio and associated types may serve as a marker for the historically attested Chorotega migrations to Nicaragua, Chiapas, and nearby areas.",3070,Symposium,Presenter,3070,Kelsey,Willis

",Intermediate Area,Digital Archaeology: Simulation and Modeling,Mobility,"Sometime before AD 1, a dynamic interaction and exchange network developed among the villages and hamlets of Greater Nicoya. The range and frequency of trade within this region is demonstrated by geochemically sourced ceramic and stone artifacts. The travel routes along which these artifacts were traded remain poorly understood. Geographic information systems (GIS) offer a means to predictively model the optimal terrestrial and aquatic travel routes that interconnected the settlements of Greater Nicoya. Accounting for both pedestrian travel on land and canoe-borne travel in the rivers and lakes, I use a GIS to present a probable simulation of the travel infrastructure that facilitated the regional movement of trade goods. I then test and refine the results of my simulations against the rest of the archaeological record. By interpreting this simulated travel network and the given distribution of traded goods within an intersocietal interaction framework, I discuss the role that intraregional movement and mobility played in the evolution of the societies that once thrived in this section of southern Central America. While some trade goods traveled long distances, most interactions were oriented locally or among neighboring polities.",3070,Symposium,Presenter,3070,Adam,Benfer

",Intermediate Area,Other,Mobility,"Traditional narratives within Nicaraguan archaeology, based on primarily ethnohistoric rather than archaeological evidence, have privileged the arrival of external actors from Central Mexico at the expense of indigenous developments and have emphasized imposed change rather than situated continuity. Especially given that as archaeologists, our primary sources are material culture, we should approach mobility from a materialist engagement with the flows and hardenings of matter, sensu Manuel De Landa. This framework will allow for more nuanced interpretations of multidirectional movement, as well as an acknowledgement of the emergent properties that may have arisen from these interactions. Such a nonlinear approach will require a redefinition of the spatial logics of orientation posited by culture-areas, aided by employing the concept of landscape as defined by historical ecology. It will move towards a re-entanglement of humans and environments, which I argue are enmeshed and inseparable. My research centers around Lake Cocibolca, tracing flows of lacustrine resources between the multiple communities of practice situated around and within it and the sedimentation of these flows in the landscape. It is an explicit attempt to illustrate the vital role of multiple forms of localized movements, which have been overlooked in favor of unidirectional trans-isthmus migrations.",3070,Symposium,Presenter,3070,Lucy,Gill

",Other,Other,Communities of Practice,"The relationship between individuals and urban soundscapes can tell us about the personhood and sonic practices of people in the past. To reconstruct the interaction between a musician and audience in archaeological contexts, I introduce a novel theoretical framework called ‘communities of engaged performance’ (CEP). CEP is defined as the transmission of knowledge through performance resulting in variable group-specific sound practices. CEP is derived and builds upon theories of ‘communities of practice’ and is identifiable in the archaeological record as intentional modifications to both space and sound-related artefacts. CEP is especially pertinent to the discussion of multicultural social organization, because it denotes group identity based on consistencies within practices rather than by ethnic origin. For example, variation in instrument design, playing of a musical instrument (gestures, finger positions, etc.), or in soundscapes might suggest the presence of several distinct communities of engaged musical performance.  On the other hand, consistency or shared practices across groups might reflect the development of a single performance community. A case study from Central America will explore these different aspects of CEP in a multi-ethnic landscape.",3070,Symposium,Presenter,3070,Katrina,Kosyk

",Intermediate Area,Ceramic Analysis,Communities of Practice,"Despite being the largest country in Central America, Nicaragua’s archaeological record remains the least explored and most ignored. One consequence of this is that reconstructions of Nicaragua’s prehistory have tended to rely overmuch on rather sparse (and not necessarily reliable) ethnohistoric accounts in which migration from Mesoamerican homelands is heavily emphasized, generally to the detriment of other kinds of cultural phenomena, including indigenous developments that are not explicitly “Mesoamerican”. Meanwhile, only sporadic attention has been paid to the archaeological record itself, and the potential evidence that it provides for (a) actual migration and/or conquest, (b) interaction and mobility between groups within Nicaragua and beyond, and (c) multiculturalism across Greater Nicoya. This paper argues that understanding of Greater Nicoya’s multicultural prehistory would benefit from approaches in which archaeological interpretations are informed but not dominated by ethnohistoric evidence—approaches that not only treat migration as a cultural phenomenon that must be demonstrated in the record rather than taken for granted but which also are capable of recognizing archaeological evidence of potential interaction between diverse groups.",3070,Symposium,Presenter,3070,Larry,Steinbrenner

Was a Mesoamerican monumental stone sculptural tradition adopted in eastern Costa Rica?,Mesoamerica,Other,Iconography and Epigraphy,Cultural Transmission,"The unique monumental stone sculptural form known as a “Chacmool” —a reclining human with an offeratory bowl on its abdomen— first appeared in the late Epiclassic period in Mesoamerica, most notably at the Toltec site of Tula in Central Mexico and the Maya site of Chichen Itza in the Yucatan. The form is known across Mesoamerica in archaeological contexts from Michoacán, Mexico to Guatamala and El Salvador. It persisted in Central Mexico to the time of the Aztec empire and European Contact, when a Chacmool was a major feature at the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan. Carlson has identified the uniquely posed male human form as having derived specifically from the stance of a Mesoamerican ballplayer. Subsequent research has demonstrated clear associations between Chacmool sculptures and ballcourts. Several examples of a similar sculptural form have been found at the site of Las Mercedes in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica.

",Intermediate Area,Other,Mobility,"Periodic changes in the pre-Columbian material culture of Central America are typically attributed to the impact of either migration to and/or conquest of regions by foreigners, or the diffusion of ideas along exchange networks. While technological and iconographic linkages are frequently raised as evidence for these events, very rarely are their mechanisms adequately defined or demonstrated archaeologically. Describing these changes, particularly involving groups of differing linguistic and/or ethnic backgrounds, traditional linear narratives tend to focus on episodic cultural succession—the replacement of a passive (generally ‘indigenous’) group by a well-defined donor group or worldview—when some critical tipping point is met. In the material culture of Central America, this tipping point is frequently identified by shifts in choice of raw material, technology, symbolic content, function, and/or decorative style.  

This symposium aims to transcend over-simplified notions of human mobility and social organization. In many regions, ethnohistoric and colonial records indicate that major centers frequently contained differing linguistic or ethnic groups at European contact.  We welcome all papers that explore human mobility from multiscalar, nonlinear perspectives, and/or the potential implications of multicultural lifeways for archaeological reconstructions. How might we better access and demonstrate mobility and multicultural social organization in the record?

Drawing primarily on economic and behavioral ecology models, these studies have focused on subsistence strategies, carrying capacity, resource over-exploitation, extinctions, diet and health, and related questions such as the translocation of species. Food is integral to non-economic, social and cultural processes, though, and some anthropologists and food historians would argue that food is culture. The purpose of this forum is to discuss food-related issues such as identity and cuisine, performance, cultural taboos, status and social differentiation (i.e. the relationship between cuisine and social position), the symbolic meanings of some foods, creolization or transculturation, resistance and many others processes in the Caribbean’s ancient and recent pasts.

Archaeological sites in Alaska are among the oldest in the Americas, providing valuable information concerning human/animal interactions. Although there is substantial amounts of archaeological information present in the literature, there is a distinct lack of indigenous ecological knowledge. The goal of this project is to combine traditional indigenous ways of knowing with archaeological methods to make inferences about past human behaviors. The traditional knowledge camp, conducted during the summer of 2017 along the banks of the Yukon River, was a collaboration between elder Paul Williams Sr. and the University of Alaska Fairbanks. It was created for elders to teach Gwich’in ways of knowing to community members and students in a traditional fish camp setting. This research utilized that learning space to explore the effects of traditional capture, processing, and cooking activities on fauna in a way which appropriately represented traditional elder knowledge. Isotopic analysis was then used to quantitatively associate the modern subsistence activities to prehistoric behavior. The research to be presented will discuss how the traditional knowledge and the isotopic analysis of this project informed about past human behaviors of the arctic.",3074,Symposium,Presenter,3074,Dougless,Skinner

How can we define the lithic landscape? How did humans provision themselves in eastern Beringia, and how did these provisioning behaviors change through time? Toolstone procurement and selection behaviors influence toolkits, mobility, and settlement strategies; therefore, they are important in explaining prehistoric behavioral adaptation and the complexities of landscape use. We can begin to explore toolstone procurement in the Nenana Valley of central Alaska through geochemical sourcing studies. Portable x-ray fluorescence (pXRF) is a useful geochemical tool for characterizing non-obsidian volcanic materials (basalts, dacites and andesites). In an effort to define the lithic landscape in the Nenana Valley and explore hunter-gatherer land-use strategies, this paper presents results of a raw material survey conducted during the 2015-2017 field seasons aimed at mapping the distribution of knappable volcanic materials in the valley.

There are occasions when the archaeological definition of toolstone material and the geological definition of the same toolstone material do not match. A situation where this discrepancy might arise is when archaeologists give a more specific name to a cryptocrystalline silicate that is difficult to identify based on visual analysis. An understanding of the geological definition and geochemistry of toolstone can allow archaeologist to ask more specific questions about toolstone provenance, procurement, and use.  The toolstone variability among sites in the Tangle Lakes Region is not well understood, and is thought to belong to two local quarries. This project seeks to understand the geochemical composition of two cryptocrystalline silicate toolstone quarries and visually similar artifacts from specific activity areas from three sites in the region at varying distances from the quarries. The toolstone variability will be defined by geochemical groupings using XRF and pXRF analysis. Future analysis will attempt to geochemically match the artifacts with the two quarries, and learn if there is more variation in the material than can be accounted for by the two quarries.

This landscape approach to managing and interpreting resources is particularly important when looking at game drives. Many Alaskan game drives are comprised of stone alignments that were used to direct animal movement across a landscape. Game drives vary in form, but most are demarcated by stacked or piled rock cairns or monoliths. Some are extensive and complex while others are minimal and ephemeral, as they range from a few stacked rocks in a row to several hundred in long lines. Spatial analysis of game drives found in northern Alaska points to patterns that reflect intentional landscape use and integration with their surroundings, including intersecting valleys, water sources, ridgelines, and material sources.

Populations continued to move northward within the prairie and coalesced around what is today Tupelo, MS, in the 1600s. The move from a riverine to upland setting involved a dramatic shift in practices of historical ecology. The rich soils and open terrain of the prairie system at the time of European contact were likely a result of repeated burning and other modifications by ancestral Chickasaw, leading to an early description of the countryside as “pleasant open forests of oak chesnuts and hickory so intermixt with savannas as if it were a made landskape.” Our work describes how the historical ecology of migration was an outgrowth of climate change, regional social tensions, and the later arrival of Europeans.",3075,Symposium,Presenter,3075,Charles,Cobb

These are just a few examples of projects where the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) failed to protect cultural resources deemed significant by Native American tribes. In these instances, why did NHPA fail? Largely because NHPA does not consider impacts to the complete suite of cultural resources. It only addresses historic properties and historic properties “of traditional religious and cultural significance”. This narrow focus makes NHPA a less-than-perfect tool to deal with cultural resources when it comes to today’s current issues and concerns. Is there an alternative? For years, experts suggest that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is better equipped to protect a wider range of cultural resources. In this presentation, I highlight several court cases where NEPA has successfully protected cultural resources when NHPA has failed to do so under similar circumstances. This ultimately shows the broad strokes of NEPA are a stronger tool for preserving cultural resources today rather than the limiting paintbrush of NHPA.",3077,Symposium,Presenter,3077,Jamie,Palmer

This being the case, the questions always arise, how do we document these linear features and how do we remain consistent with recordation, context, significance and integrity beyond our lands? Many agencies are dealing with this using formal historic contexts or Multiple Property Documentation Forms as outlined by the United States National Park Service, while others are using exemptions and categorical exclusions in formal agreement documents.

Looting issues can be exacerbated by the limited on-the-ground resources of federal agencies that manage millions of acres. The proactive actions the BLM is taking against looting has resulted in increased Archaeological Resources Protection Act investigations, the recovery of looted artifacts, and educational campaigns to curb unintentional, destructive behaviors. The BLM-Utah’s dual approach of education and enforcement illustrates the active role the BLM is taking to reduce looting. The BLM-Utah manages large collections of archaeological artifacts recovered from law enforcement investigations and prosecutions, is currently determining best practices for the long-term curation of recovered artifacts, and is developing anti-looting centered interpretation of the collections.

Iberia has followed a unique trajectory in the development of metallurgy, with a case for the independent invention of copper smelting in the southwest, and small-scale production of bronze and other metals across the Peninsula until Roman occupation. The advent of Roman imperial control of labour and mines constituted a sea change in the scale and intensity of metal exploitation in Iberia with the introduction of large-scale mining, smelting, and production operations. What did this change look like within communities? How did local people adopt, adapt, or reject these new technologies and practices?

Despite this consensus, there is a pressing need for further research on the topic. Publications dedicated to the study of castro architecture are few, and they have mostly taken a broad approach that focuses on apparent commonalities between sites from across Galicia and northern Portugal. Authors have placed undue emphasis on singular features of the evidence from each site, overlooking the more complex and problematic questions that arise when a structure is viewed in the context of its own settlement. While these works have been effective in establishing some distinct architectural trends, their interpretive components are often oversimplified or unnecessarily speculative. Such an approach encourages tentative generalizations and contributes little toward an in-depth understanding of castro communities.

Usually they are associated with animal fodder and fuel.  But what if they were condiments? Recently there has been more information on wild herbaceous plants and insects as part of rural people’s cuisines.  These oft-hidden ingredients should be recalled when taxa lists are studied, as some could have been important if rarely used spices and flavoring ingredients. We see, for example, that some creations in Europe’s cuisine are entirely composed of what some might call weedy species.  Consider the ingredients of cordials across Europe, drinks that can include up to 15 ‘wild’ taxa. These plants were collected, nurtured and cultivated in and around kitchen gardens and houses.  For example, the current Italian kitchen garden weed Portulaca was not only eaten in salads in the past and into the present in some rural locations, but it also interestingly has helpful blood pressure lowering capacities, further suggesting that local weeds that grew next to people’s houses and in their nearby kitchen gardens were potentially essential to cuisines, flavors, as well as the health of the inhabitants.

Rejolladas, like cenotes, are sinkholes formed in the karstic bedrock of Yucatán, although they do not reach to the level of the water table.

At the nearby site of Kulubá it has also been shown that rejolladas share some of the same significance within Maya cosmology as cenotes and caves. Their locations, deeper into the earth, may have been seen as places with additional potential for communication with the underworld.

At Naachtun (Northern Peten, Guatemala), we studied charcoal remains from archaeological contexts in relation with pedological data to reconstruct forest resources and land management through time. Since the beginning of Naachtun's occupation at the end of the Preclassic period (≈ AD 150), domestic firewood economy seems to have been closely linked to the local agrarian system. Wood was collected in semi-opened woodlands, suggesting a reliance on both fallow lands and preserved forests probably close to human settlements. In that context, the observation of an important shift in firewood collection strategies during the second half of the Late Classic period (AD 750-830), from opportunistic gathering of a wide range of forest species to a heavier reliance on fruit tree species, allows us to draw hypotheses on the intensification of arboriculture practices and the progressive transformation of woodlands around the site.

Historically, archaeologists have focused on outfields to reconstruct ancient agriculture and subsistence practices. On the other hand, researchers studying contemporary gardening practices understand the cultural, economic, and ritual significance of gardens. Gardens are spaces where food, medicine, construction materials, and plants of aesthetic value are grown for household consumption and for sale in markets. They are also spaces to conduct household activities, generate supplemental income, and maintain cultural memory. Archaeological explorations of garden spaces, particularly in the American Neotropics, have tended to focus on their identification, through soil chemical, archaeobotanical, and spatial analyses. Now that we have refined our ability to identify garden spaces, we can turn to more anthropologically oriented questions. How do households use cultivated infield spaces, and what meanings are given to these activities? How do gardens serve as spaces for the display of wealth and status and as spaces of cultural memory? How do gender dynamics interact with physical garden spaces? Can changes in garden cultivation reveal larger shifts in the political economy?

Furthermore, digital data can be used to generate measurements that are simply not possible with analog data. However, as computing technology continues to become faster, more powerful, and cheaper, and the ease of collecting massive amounts of data increases, it is fair to ask: Are our abilities to analyze and interpret these data keeping up? This paper addresses this question at a time in archaeology when digital methods are more accessible than ever, and where processing data requires little more than the push of a button to run “black box” functions without really understanding the theory behind it. In turn, the interpretation of such data often takes a back seat and little is ultimately added to the anthropological understanding of a site.

Without sufficient training data for supervised classification, an iterative spectral clustering method was used to group spectrally similar pixels from multispectral imagery into a large number of spectrally distinct but unknown classes. By visually assessing and removing classes that do not correlate with known sites in the region, the remaining classes provide a map for prospective site locations. This work illustrates how satellite imagery and digital remote sensing methods enable the inspection of large areas with little processing time, something that would be impossible from the ground in a single field-season.

In this paper we consider the implications of the replication of this sculptural form, its role in articulating an elite agenda linked to the production of cacao, and its pertinence to sites of varying scale and relative regional authority. A similar suite of meanings engaged with cacao and supernatural characters persisted during the Classic period, especially in courtly circles.  Yet the iconographic and social antecedents for these concepts emerged far earlier, likely between 500-300 BC.  We explore the ways in which these Late Formative messages of elite authority, expressed metaphorically but laden with the economic implications of cacao production, proliferated across the physical landscape of Mesoamerica by the advent of the Late Formative period.

Sak Pol Pak is a small site encompassing the entire hilltop, with no room for agriculture and is difficult to access, yet it contains the largest pyramid-temple outside of Pacbitun’s epicenter. At the foot of the hill is the deepest, and most complex cave system in the Pacbitun area—a primary landscape drain for the region—as well as several other unrelated karst landmarks. In this paper, we analyze Sak Pol Pak from a Mesoamerican ideational landscape perspective, specifically that mountains, caves, and water were inextricably linked in thought, to propose the site was a significant ceremonial pilgrimage shrine for Pacbitun. Drawing on ethnographic, ethnohistoric and iconographic sources demonstrating mountains were believed to be living guardians of the wildland, and filled with water, while caves were mouths, exhaling aromatic, smoke-like breath, filling the skies with rain clouds, we conclude two of the primary uses of this hilltop shrine were rain and agricultural rituals.",3081,Electronic Symposium,Presenter,3081,Jon,Spenard

These were disposed of in natural caves along cliffsides surrounding residential sites as well as in a variety of above-ground mausoleum constructed at highly visible locations.  In this paper, I develop a typology of sepulchres and analyze their spatial patterning.  Building on ethnographic and ethnohistorical material, I argue that the different types of mortuary constructions and their specific distribution across the Rapayán landscape reflected different kinds of mortuary programs. On the one hand, rituals honoring the dead located in caves and smaller mausoleums grounded people in place and participated in the construction of group identity. I suggest that the deceased in this funerary program became ancestral spirits and were likely commemorated as an anonymous collectivity. On the other, rituals celebrating the deceased placed in tall multi-story buildings distributed at the top of hillside embodied political competition among kin groups and were ultimately used to legitimize power.  I suggest that the deceased in this funerary program became ancestors and were celebrated as the named founding ancestors of kin groups.",3081,Electronic Symposium,Presenter,3081,Alexis,Mantha

Implementation of stylistic seriation bolstered by art from more securely dated archaeological deposits allowed for the development of a chronological sequence of rock art styles in Huánuco. The research revealed rock art played a prominent role in expressing changing social relations in the region. This paper focuses on the rockshelter, Gonga, and its rock art panel that was created and repainted multiple times over the millennia. An early painting depicts a human couple, while later repaintings emphasized the female character and the male figure was smeared with paint. I propose that the initial painting served to instantiate the people represented by the figures as founding ancestors of an ayllu (kinship group) based on the timing of the painting in conjunction with the appearance of public burial structures called chullpas. The highlighting of the female character at the expense of the male indicates a negotiation or contestation of prevailing social relations.

In addition to leaving material remains scattered throughout the landscape, this political history was encoded in ritualized performances still practiced today in these coastal communities, as well as in their oral traditions and territorial-narratives. Our interdisciplinary research project in the region demonstrates that mountains, caves, lagoons, and the ocean itself served as portals for both animal and human agents, moving and operating in between the physical and spiritual realms.

These beings and forces were accessed through sacred landmark portals—caves, rockshelters, boulders, mountains, hills, and bodies of water—variably called wak’a, ch’een, and tzuultqu’a—where ritual petitions were made for gaining their favor, where community origins were celebrated, and where rulers demonstrated their supernaturally-sanctioned right to rule.

Excavations over two seasons in Front E prioritized horizontal exposures in order to assess these possibilities. They confirm the presence of open plazas and residential structures in the south of the front, and larger, decorated structures of likely ceremonial function to the north, defining the central precinct of the Plaza of the Columns. In this paper we review the excavation contexts, architecture, preliminary artifact analysis, and working hypotheses concerning the diverse functions of the area, changes over time, and what both contribute to better understanding the political economy of Teotihuacan.

Politicians, from the left and right, bemoan what they term “crumbling infrastructure,” offering fixes by way of material and technological improvements to roads, waterways, cities, and energy grids.  Scholars draw on and expand posthumanist theories to analyze and expose how infrastructure does not just passively support social aims, but actively shapes (and subverts) human intentions. These discussions sharpen focus on the material characteristics and necessities of infrastructure, but frequently neglect to equally take into account the ideological mechanisms—processes of labor coordination, perceptions of progress, or projects for sustainable ecology—that are essential to and inseparable from infrastructure.  With this paper, I ask how archaeologists, with their unique ability to record and interpret long-term socio-material processes, might add to such discussions of infrastructure. I argue that “crumbling infrastructure” is a misnomer because it defines infrastructure as fixed materials rather than fluid entities that are parts of broader assemblages comprising things, people, and ideas. I present data from Cusco, Peru during early Spanish colonization to examine the interwoven ideologies and materials that can bring infrastructure into being, and relegate it to ruin.

Rather, its development might more productively be characterized as a process of “growth” in which socio-material systems for facilitating the movement and production of matter and things emerged in relation to a range of differentiated actors and unruly cultivation conditions. The durable associations of soils, cultigens, and water appear to belie the common characterization of the Raichur Doab as a space of inherent “fertility” and calls into question the assumption that the region’s unique multiculturalism during the medieval period was an outcome of competition for its economic resources, as is commonly emphasized.",3086,Symposium,Presenter,3086,Andrew,Bauer

Ironically today, archaeological practices, situated in late 20th Century normative systematics and the constraining objectives of compliance-initiated archaeological field projects (often undertaken in the interests of furthering large-scale infrastructure), unwittingly contribute to both reductive understandings of the region’s rich pre-colonial past and an overly biased sample of the archaeological record, one in which in which past cultural landscapes are analytically difficult to conceive.",3086,Symposium,Presenter,3086,Peter,Johansen

",Historic,Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology,Settlement Patterns,"The Spanish conquest of the Philippines redesigned the indigenous landscape to adhere to the idealized orthogonal plan outlined by King Philip II’s Ordinances of 1573, centered on the church plaza. This reconfiguration facilitated the successful political, economic, and religious control of the colonial possession. An aspect of this resettlement plan is the concept of Bajo de Campana (under the bell) that implied control through the ringing of the church bell. The plaza complex, which is exemplified by the policy of reducción, projects a Spanish ideal Catholic Society, whereby the configuration of the physical landscape was ordered. Reducción aimed to consolidate colonial control over Philippine indigenous communities by compelling prominent individuals to relocate into poblaciones within hearing distance of church-bells. Bell ringing ordered daily life by signaling times to congregate and by marking special occasions. The audibility of church-bells also marked the extent of the Crown’s territorial holdings. To understand the processes associated with this colonial accommodation, we explore the social, religious, and environmental ramifications of Spanish settlement-building programs in the Philippines by examining spatial, acoustic, ethnohistoric, and archaeological data from plaza complexes located at two Spanish-era church sites: Quipayo and St. Francis of Assisi (both established in 1578).",3086,Symposium,Presenter,3086,Jared,Koller

This paper approaches this matter via the analysis of archaeological, historical, and ethnographic data over the past 1000 years in the Basin of Mexico. This case is particularly relevant because this region’s landscapes, places, and people both have defied and haven fallen within the limits of the Anthropocene cosmology. The development in infrastructures tied to varying institutional systems has always had to encounter—physically, socially, and culturally—the materiality of precedent, a trajectory that shows the Anthropocene is not simply geological or cultural but also is political.

Infrastructures are increasingly seen as unruly or fragile historical assemblages that can transcend or disrupt the historical conditions of their production. In this symposium, we ask contributors to pull on their expertise and case studies in studying the built environment, technologies, and landscapes to respond to one central question about infrastructures: how do physical and social dimensions of infrastructures relate across time and space? We urge contributors to address this problem through specific archaeological case studies and by considering issues that might be subsumed within them. These include (1) infrastructures that facilitate some political projects, prevent others, and outlive still others; (2) infrastructures that are invisible and taken for granted or provide the material for spectacle, conflict, or violence, and (3) the multiple intended and unintended dimensions and consequences that stem from the coupling of social and physical infrastructures.",3086,Symposium,Chair (Primary),3086,Christopher,Morehart

Despite the fact that most archaeologists are employed by CRM firms, government agencies, museums, or community-based institutions, much of this discussion has occurred within and around academic environments. This panel will focus its discussion on how we can bring diversity to the forefront of non-academic archaeological practice by considering the following questions:
-What does inclusive archaeology look like when the work is client-based?
-How do we diversify the discipline, particularly in the areas of CRM, government, and museum archaeology?
-How do people’s experiences of racism, homophobia, and sexism influence whether or not they pursue professional archaeology? 
-What programs and initiatives are currently in place that focus on outreach and education to minority groups? 
The panel will encourage the audience to discuss these questions and generate ideas about how to make archaeology a more inclusive, engaged community.

Near the site of El Zotz in northern Guatemala, this technology has aided in the identification of fortresses, terraces, and a network of raised roads. Archaeologist who employ LiDAR focus principally on the structural data acquired from the LiDAR point clouds. Building on these methodologies, we assess the benefits of incorporating both structural and spectral derived data from LiDAR sensors. Specifically, we address the use of intensity measurements attained during a 2016 flight over the northern Peten by a Titan Multispectral Mapping LiDAR. Intensity measurements are used to create multispectral datasets of above and below canopy measurements that clarify spectral properties of the archaeological landscape. These datasets allow archaeologists to assess how structural components of tropical environments (canopy height, varying vegetation, and surface elements) relate to their spectral properties. Additionally, these multispectral datasets allow researchers to regionally assess long-term effects of landscape use and change in Mesoamerica.",3090,Symposium,Presenter,3090,Omar A.,Alcover

Features such as terrain, monumental and residential architecture, can be made more visible in a broader context through derivative products from photogrammetry, including but not limited to digital elevation models, watersheds, hillshades and vegetation color. At the site of Yaxuna, we use orthomosaic and photogrammetric registration to contextualize residential buildings with the sacbe which links to the sites of Ekal and Coba. The notable importance of the sacbe was highlighted by past exchange of people, goods and ideas between these communities, and is now pronounced by physical features in construction architecture and physical layout.

The Preclassic period was the period during which the construction of monumental architecture such as E-groups and Triadic Group occurred at numerous sites including Tayasal. It was also the period during which ritualistic ideologies and collective identity were established and permeated. At Tayasal, the massive platform was elevated by a natural hill and held several platform groups. Two Triadic groups were constructed at the margin of the site, probably indicating the boundary of the community. The construction effort required for such monumental architecture may be a result of the emergence of a collective community identity and political authorities.

Heritage museums formed archaeological collections with donations or purchases from private collectors who often depended on individuals that made a business out of locating sites with the desired pieces. The continued institutionalization of collections without context that gave rise to several museums has contributed to the perpetuation of an antiquities market that has negatively impacted the community’s connection to the country’s indigenous heritage and its perceived value and relevance. 
Heritage legislation regarding the protection of pre-Columbian archaeological materials continues to be weak. Despite the bureaucratic control over international scientific research, there are no local regulatory mechanisms that register the sale of archaeological objects by street vendors, huaqueros, or between private collectors that continue, at a lesser but impactful rate, to expand their collections, prestige, and market value.

But these weren’t the first indications of an emerging market: Caribbean forgeries had been circulating since at least the 1950s. The artistic heritage of the pre-Columbian Caribbean still remains largely understudied, with far smaller-scale production than seen in neighbouring regions like Mexico and Peru (with their own long-established, highly prolific forgers) – two of a number of factors that have led not only to site looting but entrepreneurial ‘reinterpretations’ of ancient artforms, both aimed at filling voids in private collections. These neo-artforms eventually enter museum collections, and are published in glossy catalogues as the genuine article, perpetuating the continuation of a particular forger’s oeuvre, cementing it as an established, ancient ‘style’, and so skewing understanding of past artistic expressions and meanings. The forger's craft has become increasingly sophisticated, deceptive and profitable.

It was hoped this would allow both museums to advocate the small island of Carriacou as a site of particular archaeological significance, to stimulate scientific tourism and promote the research potential of the island to post-graduates.
However, the making of the casts has raised some potentially problematic issues. The original intention was that the museums would display the casts correctly labelled as copies. This has not happened, raising the question as to whether or not the casts are moving from being mere “replicas” to being fakes: copies which deceive - however unintentionally or benignly.

These relations are visible in contemporary museum settings as well as in the art world as such, and may be particularly poignant in the case of the Caribbean and Central America with its diverse manifestations of emotive styles and materials such as wood and stone. Historically deep and widespread, 19th and 20th century Central American trafficking of pre-Columbian things was tied to foreign-owned plantations and centred on San Jose, Costa Rica, leading to a scarcity of a ‘Nicaragua’ provenance indicator in current-day museum signage. Eventually, archaeology emerged from such uncontrolled collecting and now works to counter looting, yet market demand for objects remains stable. 
This paper explores the ongoing resilience of authenticity and its persistence in the global art market. I argue that this is in part due to the ascribed inspirational value Amerindian objects hold in modern art, as argued in the notion of primitivism. Primitivist art is seen in opposition to modernity, ascribing it legitimacy through temporal or cultural distance. With some exceptions, programs focussed on revitalizing artisanship and producing high-quality copies or working on stylistic and technical innovations are countered by rendering this primitive authenticity.

Of the 19,149 bones examined from a 2016 excavation, all were identified to at least an animal’s taxonomic order, although identification to the species level was usually not possible due to the fragmentary nature of the sample. This information was compared with radiocarbon data to determine changes to diet through time as well as with oral histories from Seminole community members in order to compare stated dietary preferences with prehistoric evidence. The study determined that the three most prominent animal types present are turtle, fish, and snake, and that there were fluctuations in animal composition present throughout time which may indicate a changing environment and differential resource availability and exploitation.  There is strong evidence that climatic changes, specifically the Little Ice Age, had an impact on the diets tree island inhabitants.  Understanding the environmental changes through time and their impacts on subsistence patterns indicate the ways in which tree island inhabitants reacted to these environmental changes.",3094,Electronic Symposium,Presenter,3094,Brandy,Norton

As such, by examining paleoenvironmental change on seasonal and climatic scales, we can further understand this unique environment and infer how it has shaped human and animal histories of the past. This work will be carried out by employing broad spectrum ecological theories which shall provide the necessary framework to understand past resource scheduling, seasonal mobility patterns, and fluidity of resource utilization by the paleo-inhabitants of the region. 

Inferences based on several sites across South Florida will illustrate the paleo-resiliency of the regional inhabitants to adapt to variable environmental change including fluctuations in water levels and vegetative communities. A broad regional framework analyzing zooarchaeological materials from sites within the Northern Everglades and surrounding areas will contribute to the knowledge-base of the area from the Late Archaic Period to the present.

Nevertheless, archaeological exploration of the area to date has successfully contextualized the nature and transitions of non-perishable material culture. However, organic remains rarely survive in funerary contexts due to the high acidity of the soil, high humidity, and high precipitation in this region. Human remains almost never remain in the stone-lined tombs of Greater Chiriquí, in which one or more occupants were buried (as evidenced by the number and placement of mortuary offerings). But in shell-bearing middens along the coast, the increased soil pH from high calcium carbonate contents allows better preservation of human and animal bone. These differences in preservation have led to a sharp division in the variety and quality of mortuary information derived from coastal (lowland) and inland (highland) sites. The present study traces the few examples of human remains recovered from archaeological sites in the region and what they tell us about the cultural activities and health of pre-Columbian populations.

Kin-based population structure is the result of a migratory behavior of a familial group in which fragmentation, movement and relocation occurs among populations of high mobility such as hunter-gathers and mobile agriculturalists.

The reintroduction of freshwater into the oceans radically changed global sea-levels and littoral landscapes. Over the last 20,000 years, approximately 15-20 million km2 of landscape has been submerged worldwide. Sea-level rise explains the rarity of glacial period coastal archaeological sites. Understanding Florida’s Paleoindians’ interactions with the coastal environment requires an accurate sea-level curve for the Gulf of Mexico. Balsillie and Donoghue (2004) sea-level curve has been the standard model for oceanic transgression in the Gulf for over a decade. Yet, when compared to global sea-level curves, there are discontinuities within their model.

Past research has demonstrated that Florida cherts can be coarsely differentiated into various quarry clusters on the basis of microfossil inclusions, and more recent research has suggested that geochemically characterizing these cherts may further improve provenance determinations. New methodological approaches include using a combination of microfossil analysis, NAA, and LA-ICP-MS to provide accurate qualitative and quantitative descriptions for Florida cherts. Additionally, the sampling and description of previously unstudied prehistoric quarry sites is improving our understanding of the geochemical and microscopic variability inherent in Florida cherts. By intensively sampling both terrestrial and inundated sites on a cluster-by-cluster basis, our characterization resolution will be significantly enhanced on regional and local levels, and new conclusions can be drawn about past human mobility within an improved geographic and temporal framework.

A lack of robust unfluted point assemblages found in secure context in association with radiocarbon datable material has made interpreting these types difficult. However, a few sites in the Southeast contain unfluted lanceolate points within relative stratigraphic sequences or associated with extinct fauna. Based on this evidence from these sites, these styles are often attributed to the Middle Paleoindian period (~10,600-10,200 rcybp). The Middle Paleoindian period in North America is theorized to be a time of regional specialization and settlement following a phase during which people maintained generalized, adaptable toolkits suited for high mobility. However, the rarity of discreet Middle Paleoindian components in the Southeast has made this theory difficult to test in the region. Here, I examine the only site in the Southeast at which excavations have revealed a discrete Suwannee lithic component; the Ryan-Harley site (8JE1004) in North Florida.

However, climate and other environmental shifts have left many formerly terrestrial landscapes submerged, obscuring them and rendering interpretation difficult. Despite this complication, submerged sites and landscapes can offer enhanced site preservation, unique taphonomic considerations, access to powerful remote sensing tools, and unique data for analysis. To take advantage of these benefits, archaeologists must overcome challenges that differ from terrestrial contexts. Nonetheless, these efforts on submerged sites and landscapes contribute significant data concerning human cultural developments during prehistory, especially when human groups faced rapid shifts in both ecology and climate.

This symposium explores the challenges archaeologists face when working on drowned landscapes and the range of new information these rich environments have provided. Papers presenting methodology and results for underwater landscape surveys, site testing and exploration, and underwater excavation demonstrate the growing importance of this area of research. With sites ranging in age from the terminal Pleistocene through the Late Holocene, explorations of underwater landscapes and drowned terrestrial sites are invaluable for current and future archaeological research.

Foodways-the ways we produce, prepare, and consume foods-are an important part of human society and culture and play a vital role in making and maintaining social relationships.  In the US Southwest, ceramic vessels were essential tools in nearly every task associated with the production, preparation, and consumption of food, making them an ideal source of data for understanding changes in food practices at multiple scales.

In order to make categories simpler to use, Western scholars have tended to dichotomize religious and secular. Exploring the role of Mesa Verde style mugs in the Ancestral Puebloan world, this paper takes an object biography approach and acknowledges that boundaries between religious and secular practices are not always clear cut.  Researchers tend to consider Mesa Verde style mugs an object used primarily in religious ritual contexts. However, their investigations have assumed an unnecessary dichotomy between domestic/secular and religious/ceremonial uses.

This paper examines the deposition of whole vessels and ceramic sherds from Cerro de Trincheras, Sonora, Mexico. It compares two contexts: the debris of domestic spaces, and the careful internment of vessels as part of mortuary ritual. The ceramic deposition practices of Trinchereños (Trincheras Tradition peoples) reveal the life history of the pots themselves. Despite the ubiquity of pottery by 1300 AD, Trinchereños treated their vessels with great care and consideration, vessels were mended, repurposed and included in burial assemblages showing the cumulative effects of their life histories. These insights provide context for understanding domestic refuse. While sherds help date the site and track migration, archaeologists have incomplete knowledge of how Trinchereños used pots in their daily lives.

The sequence of production may be easy to infer but the duration of each step is elusive. For instance, archaeologists have yet to devise a method for estimating how long potters spent painting vessels.

Drawing on ethnoarchaeological scholarship, Pueblo ethnographies, and experimental archaeology, I present a new method that estimates minimum painting duration based on the organization and structure of brushstrokes.

Initially, PIPP focused on the regional scale and reconstructed Late Neolithic (5,000 – 4,500 BC) long- and short-distance interactions between Herpály and Tisza sites through the stylistic, technological, and compositional analyses of lithics and ceramics. The results suggested a strongly enforced socio-cultural boundary between Tisza and Herpály sites in the Körös region. However, by focusing on the regional scale, the local dynamic interactions have been completely obscured.

This phenomenon coincided with the emergence of the expansive and geographically homogeneous Baden material culture. From the 1960s to the 1990s, a series of archaeologists investigated the relationship between kurgan builders and Baden in the Carpathian Basin at various geographic scales. They questioned whether the Baden tradition was adopted by indigenous populations, if the tradition arrived with people via migration, and what role, if any, kurgan builders played in the emergence of Baden. The research presented in this paper is a reassessment and continuation of work done by researchers such as Maria Gimbutas and Andrew Sherratt, developed within the context of long-term, international, collaborative projects that address broad anthropological and archaeological issues related to social organization and hereditary inequality.

The past 20 years have witnessed an unprecedented increase in the number of international, collaborative, archaeological research programs in the region. Building on the long-standing tradition of innovative, ambitious, regional research in central and eastern Europe, recent long-term collaborations between North American and local archaeologists and specialists have yielded groundbreaking results in the prehistory of the Holocene. These projects are significant not only at the regional level but also have contributed to major, continental and global, anthropological questions related to early village social dynamics and the emergence of hereditary inequality. The session includes papers by the directors of long-term, international, collaborative projects who will address: 1) the contributions their projects have made to major anthropological questions, 2) how the amalgamation of different research traditions, methods, and theoretical perspectives rendered their programs successful, and 3) a critical reflection of what they can do better to promote multidisciplinary international collaboration.

",Other,Other,Caves and Rockshelters,"Archaeological research in mainland Southeast Asia is a relatively recent endeavor, but as the region’s culture history has become more fully known, a gap in evidence called the “missing millennia” has emerged. The gap falls during the middle Holocene c. 6000-4000 BP when few sites have dated deposits. Yet from evidence dating before and after those millennia, important changes must have occurred, including changes in settlement systems, lithics and ceramic technologies, the appearance of cereal agriculture, and new burial practices. Recent palaeoclimate research under the auspices of the Middle Mekong Archaeological Project in northern Laos is providing possible clues related to the gap in archaeological evidence. Four new speleothem records document an abrupt trend of weakened monsoons beginning at approximately 5-4.5- ka initiating the onset of a mega-drought that peaked at approximately. 4.0 ka. The drought climax near the “4.2 ka event” is when other parts of Eurasia and Africa experienced sharp climate shifts and associated human dislocations and societal adjustments. This paper reviews the emerging evidence and proposes an initial interpretation of societal responses to this significant period of climate change",3102,Symposium,Presenter,3102,Joyce,White

The Pamunkey Indian Tribe, located in the Tidewater region of Virginia, has a long history of utilizing materials from the Reservation’s archaeological record in a variety of ways. For over a century tribal members have reused artifacts in methods similar to their intended function, and they have reimagined them to create artwork and encourage artistic inspiration. Archaeology has always played a visible role in the lives of Pamunkey tribal members, from the exhibitions displayed at the community’s museum, to the multitude of artifacts one can find along the surrounding banks of the Pamunkey River. Unfortunately, this visibility and engagement on the Reservation is in stark contrast to the archaeology of Native Americans elsewhere in the region.

Historic sites are spaces where national and personal identities are dynamically produced and negotiated.  Ideals of equity and realities of disparity may be brought into relief (or not) by telescoping the past into the space and place of the present.  These connections between past and present lives and identities are often made most salient through sites bearing artifacts interpreted through archaeology.  The authority of material culture and even more so, human remains, can profoundly transform understandings of space as having a contested past critically connected to socio-political and economic systems of the present.  Contests over histories articulated with such sites reflect the recognition and obfuscation of such conflict in daily lived experience.

Few studies have attempted to connect aboriginal ceramics research with contemporary Native peoples, either through past-to-present identity connections or through Indigenous community engagement. Additionally, there have been few efforts to integrate research across New England’s contemporary geopolitical boundaries. Recognizing these deficiencies in regional scholarship, this paper discusses two ceramics studies from New England—each exploring concepts of identity. One study centers on potters living in the Penobscot River Valley in Maine during the Ceramic Period (3050-450 B.P.), and the other focuses on the Late Woodland period (1300-1600 AD) through 17th century potters in the Connecticut River Valley in Massachusetts. Each study applied Indigenous archaeologies and technological choice strategies to an archaeological problem. However, the motivations behind the studies and the social contexts of the researchers influenced the research process and interpretations. This paper reviews these studies and the challenge of using ceramics as a central element in constructing or assigning identity while contemplating the range of factors that influence how researchers make connections between past and present peoples in the geopolitical landscape of New England.

This works distinctly on the assumption that these identities and their linked ceramic traditions are stable and unchanging; ceramics that do not fit into the expected pattern are often explained away as trade items or the arrival of new ethnic groups. This paper instead argues that ceramics reflect the sequence of ceramic manufacture generated by individual potters whose behaviors reinforce a community of practice, open to change over time through innovation and interaction. A series of detailed ceramic analysis methods were developed to interpret data from four related 17th and 18th century sites, tracking the diaspora and culture change of the Apalachee, a Native American group originally from Northern Florida. In the case of examining the ceramics of post-diaspora Apalachee, these assemblages allow an in-depth study of ceramic practice with the unique advantage of also having substantial historic documents identifying the potters’ ethnic identity.

Recent studies of the Comanche have focused on the role of horses in facilitating their rise from small-scale hunter-gatherers into major economic and political players.

To access the true depth of meaning in many canine remains, then, we must examine them with the level of precision normally reserved for human burials. This paper offers a close reading of the remains of four dogs buried in Room 822, a D-shaped kiva from T’aitöna (Pot Creek Pueblo). These dogs were ritually buried and show evidence of having been skinned before interment. The cultural significance of skins and dogs is analyzed in this paper through engagements with both descendant oral histories and folklore, as well as the theory of Amerindian perspectivism best known through the writings of Viveiros de Castro. When viewed through these lenses, the taphonomic evidence of skinning provides an important new understanding of the social and ritual role of dogs in the pre-colonial Southwest and argues for the importance of dogs as culturally rich participants in the human past.",3106,Symposium,Presenter,3106,Madeleine,Strait

A particular emphasis of this research has focused on understanding the way pre-colonial Pueblos altered the landscape for agricultural production. More recent studies have worked to incorporate indigenous voices into scholarly understandings of the landscape. So far, less attention has been paid to the way Hispano communities in New Mexico experienced and interacted with the landscape during the colonial period. Early accounts by Spanish colonists indicate that they brought wheat, lentils, melons, garlic, and other Old World cultivars with them. While these accounts indicate the colonists were growing the cultivars, previous archaeological work has produced limited evidence for the growth and use of these plants. This paper considers how the desire for specific plants impacted colonial views of the landscape and ecology of northern New Mexico through preliminary phytolith analysis. We use the evidence of everyday plant use over time to work towards a better understanding of the deep ecology of colonial life in the region.",3106,Symposium,Presenter,3106,Emily,Dawson

This will be coupled with a consideration of archaeological survey data pertaining to herding encampments identified across the broader northern Rio Grande region. By combining both these distinctive, but complementary, lines of evidence we will offer a multi-scalar account of the impact of colonial modes of pastoralism within a New Mexican context. Themes to be examined will include changes in dietary practices within the home and village, patterns of labor and movement with respect to herding economies, and transformations in entire landscapes wrought via the large-scale introduction of new species of domesticates.

Recently, post-humanist thinking has gained popularity as an approach, urging us to think about human and non-humans relationally, as having contingent qualities that vary in relation to their interaction over time. Simultaneously, we see increasing attempts to think with indigenous philosophies and descendent communities about what the environment is and does. However, there remains a disconnect between approaches that seek to include indigenous philosophies and/or post-humanist approaches, and much work of the ecological sciences which are developing at a rapid pace, providing greater precision and clarity of information. This paper considers the history of archaeology’s relationship to the idea and study of ecology, and proposes the concept of “Deep Ecologies” as an approach to human-nonhuman interactive pasts that offers the opportunity to bridge some of these perceived divides, while also being attentive to the politics of attempts to do so and the appropriative histories of archaeological work in this vein. It serves as an organizing thesis statement for the session, which presents attempts to grapple with the idea of “deep ecology” through ten years of archaeological fieldwork in northern New Mexico.

Individual papers consider the histories of particular anthropo-ecological practices, including hunting, herding, farming, and plant collection, and each emphasizes the way non-human agencies have shaped human communities in the region. In bringing these papers together, we hope to engage a deeper conversation about archaeological approaches to the emergence, persistence, and variability in human/non-human ecological relationships over time.

In addition, the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) requires all federal agencies to maintain inventories of their historic properties.  For decades, the NPS has relied upon three inventory systems: The List of Classified Structures, the Cultural Landscapes Inventory (CLI), and the Archeological Sites Management Information System (ASMIS). These systems began decades ago as paper files and continue today as electronic databases accessed via the internet.
  The inventories allow NPS to maintain and update critical information including resource type, location, condition, threats, and disturbances.  As the relevant technologies continue to develop with what seems like increasing rapidity, even these relatively modern databases are being rapidly rendered obsolete.

The past decade saw development of the “open government” digital information paradigm for public availability of information that underpins the functions of governance. Open government data provide a base for the interested public to offer expertise in aspects of necessary analyses, and to derive further public value from reuse of government data in novel ways. The open government concept has affected the practice and communication of scientific data in regulatory regimes as far flung as climate science, health science, and archaeology, among many others. In 2007 the “eight principles of open government” were coined by a group of public advocates, followed rapidly by a mosaic of federal, state, and local initiatives. The Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA) is a completely free, big data, open government data project, centered at several public institutions; DINAA embodies open government practices to develop a novel linked-open data network of archaeological site primary data and related records across the internet.

Particular attention is paid to geomasking techniques, which communicate observed spatial relationships while obscuring sensitive geographic coordinates. Currently, only two geomasking techniques are widely used in archaeology: aggregating archaeological site locations into grids or administrative units, or placing points that represent site locations at a particular distance from their true locations. These techniques, while useful, are part of a larger and growing suite of tools that visually convey spatial data without revealing sensitive site locations. Principle 6 allows researchers flexibility in tailoring methods of communicating site locations, which is useful given the range of archaeological contexts.

Tools produced are characterized by flake-core reduction strategies. The combined visual characteristics of the source material and technology employed are important chronological indicators. But, general similarities in the appearance of the raw material and factors such as variable thickness create the potential for overlap with other sources, such as Pico de Orizaba, though the latter tends to have fewer inclusions, making it more suitable for the production of prismatic blades than Guadalupe Victoria obsidian. Thus, the presence of clear-to-light-gray material in flake form is typically assigned to the Guadalupe Victoria source, whereas clear-to-light-gray material in blade form is often attributed to Pico de Orizaba. The presence of clear-to-light gray material in flake form throughout the occupational sequence of Pre-Classic and Classic period Matacanela challenged existing ideas about the efficacy of visual designation. As a result, we used pXRF to examine the entire assemblage of visually sourced Guadalupe Victoria material from excavated contexts to evaluate our accuracy in predicting source material.

Semi-intensive systematic survey in 400 km2 of the lower Cotaxtla basin showed occasional concentrations that led to propose two alternatives: state-controlled workshops obtaining and redistributing artifacts to resident population, or independent workshops servicing clients across borders, implying the existence of a market-based economy.
 
Chaîne opératoire analysis shows that, while obsidian sources (Zaragoza-Oyameles for prismatic blades and Pico de Orizaba for percussion flakes), core types and knapping techniques are identical across the survey region, there is a high incidence and a wide variety of knapping errors. The evidence reflects a well established procurement system coupled to a low degree of specialization, which opens the possibility of a third alternative: state procurement of raw material (acquired using surplus of commercial staple like cotton, cacao, or rubber), with limited individual household access and production of artifacts.

Previous research on obsidian production found a spatial association with Sauce, which could support political administration of exchange, or alternatively, identify market exchange nearby. Reliance on spatially based models alone for identifying exchange mechanisms are flawed based on equifinality, in which different forms of exchange result in the same spatial pattern. Local chipped stone artifacts have further complications to interpretation: singular geological source, universal access, and potential specialized activities. No single model will identify all competing influences on residential inventories. To handle this complexity, I use the articulation of production combined with the spatial distribution and contextual information to distinguish between redistribution and market exchange. Results indicate that market exchange was the main mechanism. The largest concentrations of primary production indicators were found near Sauce, along with the highest quantities of blade parts, which suggests that political elites encouraged market exchange even if they did not direct it.",3108,Symposium,Presenter,3108,Alanna,Ossa

Such a transgression occurred in the Sierra Mazatan of Sonora, México. In 1902, a party of Yaqui warriors freed hundreds of enslaved Yaquis from haciendas near Hermosillo, and they sought refuge in the Sierra Mazatan.  Days later Mexican troops outflanked the Yaqui warriors and attacked the camp of women and children killing 124 Yaqui.  Three weeks later Ales Hrdlicka collected the skulls of 10 individuals, human bone, hats, blankets, weapons, and a cradle board from the battlefield.  He shipped these materials to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.  The bi-national Proyecto Cerro Mazatan project worked collaboratively with the Yaqui tribes of Sonora and Arizona to repatriate the human remains and other materials that Hrdlicka took from the battlefield.

Archaeological Palynology is a well understood method for addressing these questions. Because of the constant pollen rain and the purposeful and incidental ingestion of pollen and spores, well-preserved pollen is repeatedly found in association with human habitation sites and human artifacts. Paisley Caves, Oregon, established itself as one such early human habitation site when human DNA was found in coprolites dating to the oldest associated with humans in America. In addition, the sediments within caves at the site contain an abundance of well-preserved pollen. Knowing more about the environment reflected by the sediments at Paisley Caves can tell us more about the people who lived there, the lives they led, and the obstacles they faced as they ventured into the undiscovered American continent. However, the cave setting as well as the presence of packrat coprolites, thoroughly mixed within the sediments, adds levels of complexity that makes the sediment at Paisley Caves a unique interpretive challenge.

The examinations of faunal remains of seabirds, sea mammals, and mollusk shells support the expected marine-oriented subsistence strategy. However, the site also contains a long record of botanical remains suggesting that people had access to plant resources. For this reason, a study of fossil pollen grains and macrobotanical remains have been carried out with the focus on reconstructing the paleoethnobotanical record of Gramalote. These two botanical proxies help to identify the relationships between humans and plants in this region of northern Peru during the second millennium B.C.  Grasses; reeds; food, woody and wild plants were identified suggesting an environment that allowed small-scale agriculture and a trading network during the Initial Period of Gramalote.

As largely substrate-specific in nature, fungal spores may serve as proxy for a range of phenomena, such as soil erosion, landscape burning, vegetation clearance, moisture availability, and the existence of particular plant types in a given area. Microbotanicals, including pollen, fungal spores, phytoliths, and microcharcoal, isolated from a 2.5 meter sediment core recovered from Kingwal Swamp in western Kenya are used here to demonstrate the value of fungal palynomorphs as environmental indicators, particularly when employed in concert with these more traditional proxy types. I illustrate how cross-checking of palynological interpretations with fungal data can be used to refine models of landscape change and increase interpretive confidence via the elimination of equifinal trajectories potentially responsible for observed archaeological and paleoecological data patterning.

Because of the difficulty of becoming familiar with the vast array of microfossils found in a typical pollen sample, non-pollen palynomorphs (such as fungal spores) are often overlooked in traditional palynological analyses. However, they can be indicators of various environmental changes such as fluctuations in plant and animal communities, erosion and fire events. This paper demonstrates the utility of fungal spores as paleoenvironmental proxies at two submerged sites in the Southeastern United States: Page-Ladson, Florida and White Pond, South Carolina. Non-pollen palynomorph assemblages at these sites provide evidence of considerable disturbances to vegetation, including fires, grazing and browsing regimes, and periods of erosion.

The past traditional method has focused on the of light and scanning electron microscopy and then used those results to obtain information and values which palynologists can use to interpret those. During the past decade, some scientists have turned to using other techniques such as DNA and isotopes of pollen grains to gain information about the above research goals. This paper investigates if these new techniques can in fact replace traditional pollen analysis. Ultimately, the current state of DNA and isotope research technology is unable to provide some of the most crucial information provided only by utilizing microscopic pollen analysis.

This problem of “being miscellaneous” continues despite the role of paleoethnobotanists as vital members of research teams. One of the impacts of being a sideline speciality is the lack of structured training programs to develop the botanical knowledge  alongside a standard curriculum in archaeology. Most undergraduates receive basic training in lithic or ceramic identification during field schools. However, paleoethnobotanical skills are not as frequently taught. Most training in paleoethnobotany has taken the form of a mentorship, often at great personal cost to the student.

This location was continually re-occupied for the last 3,000 years, by Late Archaic to historic-era Native American (probably Ho-Chunk) communities. Bioturbation, military activities, and other cultural and natural processes easily disturb the sandy soils at Stillwell Crossing, resulting in substantial mixing of the archaeological components, so the Phase III research design tested two questions: 1) How effective is subsurface geophysical prospecting in such contexts? and 2) How do spatial distributions of artifacts reflect both depositional and post-depositional processes at the site? Investigations demonstrated that the effectiveness of geophysical prospecting is limited, especially for identifying ephemeral pre-contact features. Vertical distribution of artifacts showed no distinctly stratified deposits, though horizontal distributions of lithic raw material varied across the three sites. Mineralogical analysis of soil samples, radiocarbon dates, and compositional analysis of a glass trade bead all yielded informative results about the extent and nature of past human activities at Stillwell Crossing. These mitigation efforts, which also included construction of a mock cultural site, enhance the military training facility at Fort McCoy.",3115,Symposium,Presenter,3115,Heather,Walder

We review the CEMML surveys and site exams along Wind Creek - a tributary of Wildcat Creek - that have produced an unexpected density of upland prehistoric sites. 

In this context, we discuss the prehistoric sites types found along Wind Creek and explore how they are part of settlement patterns within the larger Wildcat Creek watershed. We also examine differences in the artifact assemblages from 40 sites along Wind Creek, including the presence/number of hafted bifaces, scrapers, expedient tools and various types of debitage. Notably, the diagnostic hafted bifaces found along Wind Creek indicate that the area was used, at least sporadically, during the Archaic, Woodland and Late Prehistoric periods. A number of scrapers found at sites along Wind Creek conversely indicates the importance of hide-processing or perhaps wood-working in the area. We suggest that the Wind Creek locality contained important resources, perhaps available seasonally, that were exploited by prehistoric groups with habitations and base camps along Wildcat Creek.

The normal treatment for National Register eligible sites once they are found is to set them aside as off limits to training and other activities.  Naturally, this is not popular with those providing funding to keep training lands open and sustainable.  The Fort Drum Cultural Resources Program has developed unique methods for protecting sites while allowing them to be used as training assets.  In collaboration with Civil Affairs Operations, they have provided site data in the form of no-strike lists to military trainers, allowing sites to be put into play during several large-scale training events.  Program staff also served as role-players, representing host nation officials and indigenous peoples in a training scenario.  Not only did this approach enrich the training opportunity, designation of off limits areas as sacred properties where incursion would result in violent retribution or command consequences resulted in the best site protection and avoidance in the history of these exercises.

Archaic components are more dense in Xeric Longleaf Pine–Wiregrass Sandhills communities where upland flats offer long sight lines and minimal topographic relief; ideal for overland travel, logistical procurement, large game hunting and family-band migration. The spatial density of Woodland components is higher in Mesic Longleaf Pine–Wiregrass Slope, Small Stream Swamp and Depression Pond communities where less frequent, lower intensity wildfire encourages deciduous mast-bearing trees and richer soil for horticulture.

We ought to critically and reflexively evaluate our discipline’s very purpose. Instead of self-serving, academic ladder climbing and insensitive explication of scientific “truths,” the practice of archaeology has the power to strengthen indigenous rights to place and to critical resources.

Advancing archaeology towards greater inclusivity is an increasingly common conversation within the discipline. The majority of literature on this topic focuses on grassroots efforts to include marginalized descendant communities or other stakeholders in research design, implementation, knowledge dissemination and curation. An ever present and often unanalyzed aspect of research (especially abroad), are the required negotiations with government officials, who are political stakeholders invested in maintaining the status quo. These negotiations can be source of friction among research goals, community commitments and governmental regulations. My research in the Toledo District, Belize, shows that dealing with political realities while staying committed to social justice and engagement is an uncomfortable but vital balance to be struck. I argue that archaeologists can work as advocates to keep open lines of communication with governments as well as local people; we hold a privileged though awkward position that can be carefully and strategically leveraged for social justice aims. Anthropological archaeology has much to offer if we use it as a tool for greater inclusivity and social justice, within our borders or abroad.

Namely, how those emigrated objects reflect perceived values within a country; how the materiality of public and private spheres displays multifaceted identities and engagement with particular (and often overlapping) communities; and the ways in which emigrants shape, through remittances, letters, and return, the narratives of expectation and acts of consumption practiced ‘back home.’ By looking at the ways in which networks and social identities are expressed in the materiality of emigrant’s lives, I aim to engage with the complex narratives of trans-locational experiences, and the act of movement, from an archaeological lens.",3117,Symposium,Presenter,3117,Nicholas,Ames

Irish immigrants lived in every ward of Philadelphia as newcomers from various European countries settled along alleyways and courtyards throughout the city. Using Elfreth’s Alley National Historic Landmark as a case study, this paper argues that the dispersion, intermingling, and lack of segregation between immigrant groups in Philadelphia had implications for how newcomers navigated daily life and how the material culture they left behind can be interpreted as representations of material identity. A diverse population of European immigrants shared living spaces along Elfreth’s Alley during the nineteenth century, including residents from Ireland, Germany, England, Spain, Russia, the Czech Republic, and more.

Little, if any work in historical archaeology, or the archaeology of the modern world, has linked the impact of traumatic natural events and social, economic, and political structures to how cultural groups respond. In this paper, cultural resilience theory is employed to discuss the capacity of a culture to maintain and transform its world-view, cultural identity, and critical cultural knowledge. In this context, extreme events, challenges, and societal or cultural stressors inhibit or test the structure of a culture. Such is the context of the decades following Ireland’s Great Hunger. This presentation details the on-going research on Ireland’s cultural resilience in terms of the impact of the mid-nineteenth century Great Hunger. This paper focuses on the author’s archaeological research in Skibbereen, County Cork seeking to find the material manifestation of cultural resilience in the decades following the Great Hunger. The aim is to use the material remains to illustrate how Ireland’s cultural structure once on the brink of collapse was resilient enough to transform after losing half its population to either emigration or death.",3117,Symposium,Presenter,3117,Stephen,Brighton

These communities use archaeology and material culture to construct their heritage. However, few scholars have discussed how communities are constructing heritage with respect to disasters and social upheaval. This paper explores the multi-scalar construction of heritage and identity through material culture and archaeology in a post-colonial and post-disaster environment. Through a case study in Ireland, I explore heritage construction motivations and techniques following the Great Famine and the fight for independence through the present day. I compare heritage and identity on a national scale to a regional scale in County Galway and a local scale on Inishbofin, an Atlantic island off the western coast of Ireland. The examination of mutli-scalar heritage compares uses of the past following the suffering, death, and mass migration of over a million Irish people.

Settlers on the Wisconsin frontier in the mid-to-late 19th century had limited access to formal health care. Physicians who did provide services to remote populations were often poorly trained and had a limited understanding of the causes of many diseases. Thus, self-medication and alternative forms of health care became an attractive option for many frontier occupants. As a result of rapid industrialization during this period, many groups of immigrants were forced to abandon their ancestral ethnic identities and assimilate to a more homogeneous capitalistic American culture. This paper illustrates how patent medicine bottles recovered from the McHugh site provide an indication of how the McHugh family responded to the need for health care under the harsh conditions of frontier life in northeastern Wisconsin during the mid-to-late 19th century. Moreover, this analysis shows how broadly changing social conditions as well as the emergence of American popular culture may have shaped how the McHughs conceptualized ideas of sickness and disease.",3117,Symposium,Presenter,3117,Robert,Vander Heiden

While archaeologists have explored the myriad ways that mass-produced goods circulated throughout the British Empire through networks of trade and exchange, less attention has been given to the way specifically British manufactured goods were incorporated into meaningful practices of material consumption within Irish communities. This project investigates how these industrially produced consumer products became woven into the social, religious, and cultural fabric of daily life in the Irish island communities of Inishark and Inishbofin from the late 18th century to the present day. Recent archaeological investigations by the Cultural Landscapes of the Irish Coast project on Inishark and Inishbofin, combined with the oral history of island residents, will further an understanding of the significant ways that mass-produced consumer goods were meaningfully incorporated into island life through the collection of delph (ceramics) on household dressers, and consumption of tobacco pipes in everyday life and during traditional Irish wakes.

As such, the excavated material evidence is particularly suited to considerations of how we interpret, and eventually ascribe, identity in the archaeological record.

Race and low “moral character” were blamed for the endemic poverty of the island. The Irish poor were portrayed as a “race apart” whose inherent failings were at least partly to blame for the mortality they suffered during the Great Famine of 1845–1852. Recent excavations at Kilkenny workhouse and Spike Island convict prison have produced skeletal assemblages from this critical period. These collections have enabled bioarchaeological analysis of parameters mentioned by the Victorians as indicative of the distinctiveness of the Irish poor: stature, interpersonal violence, and tobacco-use. We argue that the differences between Irish and British populations in stature and risk of violence were exaggerated. Such characterizations, we suggest, were part of a strategy of “othering” that served to legitimize colonial domination. This exertion of power did not go uncontested, and we argue that aspects of both the material culture and the skeletal evidence may be indicative of forms of passive resistance.",3117,Symposium,Presenter,3117,Barra,ODonnabhain

However, analyses of the material culture have thus far failed to uncover evidence of an Irish identity distinct from an American identity. This paper presents results of an analysis of the teaware component of the McHugh ceramic assemblage that attempted to identify potential markers of traditional pre-immigration behaviors. Since tea is consumed by cultures across the world, the presence of teaware alone is not enough to indicate “Irishness.” Thus, this study explores the correlates of the material manifestation of tea consumption within the McHugh household and offers a comparison with selected contemporary sites as well as modern Irish and Irish American households.

These islanders left their homes, the seascapes that framed their lives, and entered into a new placelessness.  To Irish islanders living and working in America, crafts such making fishing nets, provided a point of entry into the emotional landscape of memory and belonging.  Nets were not just economic tools or objects; rather these practice helped islanders make their past meaningful through the repeated reenacting of crafts, and negotiate their place in the New World.  Migration is, above all else, a dissociative event, one that fundamentally challenges an individuals sense of place, of home, and identity, and creates moments in which individuals reside in one place, but “belong” in another place.

Many communities in developing nations were formally subjected to colonial governance, which imposed foreign architectural designs, irrigation agriculture and economic crops—and these systems vastly changed the social-cultural dynamics of these communities, often destabilizing systems that had been in place for generations. After colonial powers left, indigenous and local groups were left with trying to manage their countries/regions with systems poorly adapted to their geographic landscape.  In many regions, climate change is stressing communities to the brink of failure. Millions of people are subject to starvation, social/political collapse, forced migration due to degradation of the environment, and loss of their cultural heritage and social-cultural identity.

Archaeology courses that discuss climate change typically bring together data from the physical sciences, such as from ice or lake cores, with archaeological evidence of social change, such as shifting settlement patterns or food strategies. Though an understanding of these links is critical to scientific literacy and knowledge about the past, we suggest that an ethnographic perspective can deeply enrich student learning by revealing social processes beyond subsistence-based adaptations. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in rural communities in Peru, we first review how local people perceive the causes and effects of climate change, including through the lens of religious belief. Second, we draw on archaeological and available ice core evidence from the region that reveal how ancient people adapted to shifting flows of water: an ongoing process that continues today. Ultimately, we suggest that the diverse kinds of knowledge that ethnography, archaeology, and paleoclimatology produce—and the multiple ways of knowing the world that each provides—is essential for students to consider when learning about not only what happened during moments of climate change in the past, but how societies creatively responded.",3120,Symposium,Presenter,3120,Doris,Walter

Numerous reasons have been put forth over the years as to why early Anglo-American settlers decided to bury their dead on mounds, ranging from flooding issues, to avoidance of valuable farmland, to a preference for burying on high land. The fact that a number of mound sites along the bluffs of western Mississippi also have non-Indian cemeteries on them, despite even higher land occurring nearby, suggests that the story is far more complex than perceived. I suggest here that the use of mounds for burial purposes may be related to early nineteenth-century Anglo-American populations having made symbolic power statements over land that was still either being occupied or claimed by Indians. The erection of gravestones on prehistoric mounds targeted what were clearly the most visible and curious monuments of this contested landscape.

",Intermediate Area,Other,History of Archaeology,"This paper presents a brief overview over past and current trends in non-Maya archaeology of Honduras. From the beginnings of archaeological investigations in Honduras, there has been a strong research focus on the Maya city of Copan in the extreme west of the country. But already in early years, pioneers like William D. Strong, Doris Stone and Claude Baudez made valuable contributions, in order to reveal the hidden history of central Honduras, the Atlantic and the Pacific coast. The lack of research in these regions of Honduras in the following years, due to the ongoing interest in the influence of the Maya culture in western Honduras, and also to the difficult sociopolitical situation, resulted in an imbalance of archaeological research which today prevents the understanding of cultural processes between Mesoamerica and Lower Central America.
In recent years, new archaeological projects were started which reveal the great potential of research in the hitherto less studied regions. A well trained new generation of archaeologist is using new methodologies and technologies to systematically study settlement patterns, regional chronologies and intercultural relations. This new research results in the definition of new strategies for archaeological research in Honduras in the future.",3122,Symposium,Presenter,3122,Markus,Reindel

This article encompassed his research in the Gulf of Fonseca, where he spent a field season surveying and excavating sites in 1964-65. Fifty-three years later, this article still constitutes one of the most extensive descriptions of the ceramic assemblage of the Honduran side of the Gulf. However, research in the surrounding regions of the Gulf in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras, has considerably advanced in the last thirty years, and contributed to a better understanding of ceramic types and their distribution. Through a renewed analysis of a sample of the ceramic material excavated by Baudez in the Gulf of Fonseca and a review of his typology, my paper presents updated considerations about distribution of ceramic types present in the Gulf of Fonseca between the Classic and Late Post-Classic periods, with a focus on the Late and Terminal Classic. To this end, recent research and established typologies are reviewed and compared as an attempt to create relations and equivalences between types, leading to better understanding of local variations.

",Intermediate Area,Remote Sensing/Geophysics,Landscape Archaeology,"In response to the widespread destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, the US Geological Survey conducted an extensive survey of 15 modern cities in Honduras. This 2000 survey was carried out by the Bureau of Economic Geology of the University of Texas, and the resultant data were used to generate flood risk maps. The survey also produced the first lidar data collection of a Maya site; however, in the early 2000s, lidar algorithms were not capable of performing the same tasks as today. The final elevation rasters that were archived by the USGS were low resolution and had very basic ground/non-ground classification which made archaeological interpretation difficult. Over the past two years semi-raw lidar data was recovered from old magnetic tapes. We have been able to reprocess these data using current algorithms at a level suitable for archaeological investigation. The newly processed data provides unique insight into Honduran archaeological sites as well as settlement patterns throughout a large part of the country.

This study explores the actual implementation of that strategy by investigating communal feasting contexts where symbolically significant ceramics were used and incorporates new information about local identity and affiliation through a complementary study of foodways. Tracing changes in these traditions over time elucidates the ways in which these materials were articulated in practice to create enduring symbols of identity.

Despite this, recent ethnographic reports have provided indispensable information about colonial-era materials and traditions. This paper examines the archaeological record of Guadalupe along with archaeological, ethnohistoric and ethnographic reports to examine what viable information can be retrieved on precolonial architecture in north-eastern Honduras.

The belief that the periphery was occupied by simple non-Maya societies, lightly “influenced” by their more civilized western neighbors, appeared early in the development of orthodox frameworks and continues to influence archaeological perspectives. The advent of World Systems Theory and other core-periphery perspectives brought an interest in the character of the relationships but little advance in attention to the material remains that might reflect the supposed derivative nature of frontier cultural patterns.  

Understanding interaction requires methodologies that move beyond unilateral region-to-region or community-to-community connections and focus instead on the development of innovative approaches to documenting multiple overlapping networks connecting many groups within many communities. Taking ceramic systems as our focal point, we explore the potential of pottery to map links among lower Ulúa valley groups and their counterparts in adjacent regions. Delineating the distributions of these likely traces of interaction illustrates a new and more sensitive framework for assessing the movement of ideas and things in a complex landscape.

Research focuses on understanding the circumstances of Shangshan’s location (upland, intermontane basins), settlement structure, technology, and human-envirnoment interaction. In particular, by 9000-8500 BP sites are relatively large with, at least in some cases, substantial ditches were constructed around or through them.

Shangshan cultures have been identified on floodplain terraces and earth mounds within the Qujiang valley. The choice of settlement in the area (10,000+ years BP) is constrained by several geographical factors, including topography, climate, access to water resources and human factors. The relationship between cultural occupation sites and river dynamics over the Holocene is poorly known in this region. Lateral and vertical river stability can be an important determinate of land use and settlement patterns. We investigate the geomorphic record of the Qujiang in relation to the Hehuashan river terrace occupation site using geophysical methods (GPR) and cores on the adjacent floodplain to infer long-term floodplain stability. Floodplain structure is dominated by shallow narrow channels comprised of basal gravels and sand (   4 m depth), overlain by horizontally laminated infilled silty sands. We interpret the long-term natural channel pattern of the Qujiang to be a cobble-bedded, sandy anabranched river, subject to rapid and frequent lateral channel shifting and formation of large back-swamps during heavy flooding. This suggests poor habitat for occupation on the river’s floodplain and supports settlement on the adjacent Pleistocene aged river terraces.",3123,Symposium,Presenter,3123,Anna Marie,Soleski

a、There is a difference in shape of spikelet base between cultivated rice and wild rice, but it is difficlat to make comparable measurement. Therefore, it is possible to identify rice by using the characteristics of spiketet base based on one’s experience, but it is difficult to make comparison between diffirent researchers.
   b、 According to my study, some wild characterisics still can be observed on the cultivated rice of Qujialing Culture dated to 5000 years age.  This suggested that the changes of morphological characteristics might lagged during the process of rice domestication 
c、 Based on the results of discrimination analysis, the percentage of cultivated rice gradually increases, such as :47%→67%→79%→92%. This pattern suggests that the morphological characteristics of rice changed gradually during the process of rice  domestication.

This symposium outlines our current understanding of the material culture, settlement, chronology, human ecology. geoarchaeology, and palaeoethnobotany of the culture, with emphasis on the Shangshan, Huxi, and Qiaotou sites.  Shangshan dates to ca. 12,000-8,400 BP and is ancestral to the Neolithic Kuahuqiao and Hemudu Cultures. The Shangshan culture established substantial communities in elevated (40-100 m above sea level), intermountain river valleys well away from where the Kuahuqiao and Hemudu cultures eventually became established. Questions being addressed include what economically supported the occupations, how settlements were organized, the function and palaeoecology of substantial ditches at several Shangshan sites, the process of rice domestication, the meaning and technical skills behind the many forms of Shangshan pottery (including fibre tempered and thin, painted/slipped ware), and the relationships the occupations had with each other and to subsequent cultural developments in Zhejiang Province

In hopes of contributing a chapter to an open access textbook, what are the keys to making such a background chapter successful? What elements are necessary to prove that such a chapter has validity in the eyes of archaeologists but also leverages the benefits of an open source textbook? What traditional textbook themes are required and what others should be left aside to improve the way that textbooks can be used to pass on background knowledge to new students?

White of Youngstown State University in 2007, ultimately revealed the remains of an antebellum, single tuyere, charcoal iron blast furnace located in Mercer County, Pennsylvania. The facility, originally called the Seth and Hill Furnace, is presently known as the Springfield Furnace by locals. The configuration, constructed generally of heavy ashlar and rubble detritus, is listed historically as utilizing heated air, or 'hot blast' (Lesley 1859:108). Hot blast was a technical innovation in the 1830s geared to economize on time, labor, and fuel and thus increase iron production. Revelations include the discovery of an intact hearth-forehearth locus associated with a preserved tuyere embrasure that is capped by an integrated, protective iron tuyere box within the base of the hearth proper. Further, an intact ""Staffordshire"" type water-cooled breast was discovered. The untimely passing of White in 2009 created a vacuum for his students and volunteers from all walks of life.

During his 34 years at Youngstown State, John developed an expertise in industrial archaeology, with a focus on 19th century blast furnaces. Through work on historic and prehistoric sites in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, and in Israel and Central America, John gave several generations of students an array of opportunities. In addition, he made archaeology accessible to grade school and high school students through programs in summer camps.

In particular, we focus on how the use of bedrock afforded the construction of a ‘lived’ place. By looking at the materiality of its intrinsic properties, we argue that the Mixtecs of Etlatongo intentionally used bedrock as part of construction episodes in the formation of a public space so that its symbolic properties were able to emerge with the building’s form and history. Considering that ethnographic accounts mention that Mixtecs understood reality as an indivisible whole animated with sacred life forces, we examine the ways in which this existential unity manifested during construction events and through the life histories of buildings; we link our Cruz B example with ethnographic practice through subsequent construction episodes at Etlatongo that illustrate the abiding interest in certain attributes of bedrock.

The history of lithic analysis has produced many assumptions and interpretations regarding exchange, use and control of this extremely important material. Obsidian itself, as an imported resource, might have had otherworldly properties that held a special place in the cosmological construction of the world for villagers in the Valley of Oaxaca. The power of higher status community members may have been channeled through these distinct and imported materials, including obsidian. The recent excavations at Etlatongo, in the Mixteca Alta, have provided an opportunity to test these models and utilize new theoretical perspectives. Samples of obsidian excavated at Etlatongo, from both domestic and public space, demonstrate long distant relationships that the village, and specific households, may have developed in order to procure obsidian. We also explore the crafting of the material itself. Etlatongo also gives us the opportunity to systematically test distribution and frequency levels throughout the site, to determine if there was any control or redistribution over certain obsidian sources, which would be indicative of the economic and other-worldly importance of obsidian at Early Formative Etlatongo.

More specifically, this public space was focused during the Cruz B phase on two iterations of a ballcourt. We interpret the constructions of this ballcourt as a kind of public space that both linked emerging communal identity with socio-political complexity. Very specific kinds of materials were deposited in this public space; both these deposits, as well as the probable activities that occurred, transformed this into a sacred place, one that resonated beyond the Cruz B phase.

Therefore, we assess the impact of agriculture within the Middle Formative (850 – 400 BC) population from the Mixtec prehispanic society from Etlatongo, located in the Nochixtlán Valley, Oaxaca. We use archaeological and bioarchaeological data to evaluate health of 21 individuals and compare them with other skeleton collections within the same time period, from the Mixteca Alta, Valley of Oaxaca and the Coastal regions, all from Oaxaca.

BCE), Rome underwent rapid urbanization with concomitant social changes. This shift from modest settlement to urban center affected how animals were raised, distributed, and consumed. Namely, large-scale animal sacrifice rituals within the city acted as a new mechanism for distributing meat to the masses, provided by centralized authorities. The increased scale of animal sacrifice in the nascent city would have created new meanings to these rites and led to a new demand for meat in public spaces. While transhumance and larger herds had been used for meat production in central Italy before the Archaic Period, urbanization would have shifted the supply chain towards a reliance on animals raised outside the city.

Specifically, this paper examines the incorporation of isolated skeletal elements into ritual spaces, contextualizing this practice within the broader scope of Late Bronze Age human-animal relationships.

In this paper, I consider the intersections of food processing, ritual, and gendered labor through an examination of paleoethnobotanical data from Cerro León, a Gallinazo/Early Moche phase (A.D. 1-300) highland colony in the Moche Valley of north coastal Peru. A variety of ancestor rituals, work parties, and other large-scale commensal events occurred in large public spaces in high status compounds at Cerro León. But where did food preparation occur for these events, and who was likely responsible for such preparation? Employing intrasite spatial analysis, I explore the movements through various spaces, public and private, that provided opportunities for social interaction or restrictions on visibility and community integration. Drawing on archaeobotanical and ethnohistorical evidence, I argue that household members (likely women) primarily prepared food in private behind-the-scenes contexts for supra-household ritual events and public displays. These women may have prepared for public events totally apart from, and without being included, in such events. This consideration of ‘hidden’ labor sheds light on a frequently overlooked aspect of ritual and food production.",3128,Symposium,Presenter,3128,Dana,Bardolph

The large (~200-1500 person) mesa-top Ancestral Pueblo (AD 1100-1700) villages of the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico are particularly good contexts for the archaeological study of water because small water storage features, often referred to as reservoirs, are found at many villages across the region. Alternative hypotheses for feature function, such as water storage for domestic use, watery shrines, mortar mixing pits, or some combination thereof, have been proposed, but not tested. Also, archaeologists have given little consideration to how these features may serve as archaeological proxies for Ancestral Pueblo collective action surrounding water in domestic, social, and ritual spaces. As part of recent interdisciplinary investigations into the vulnerabilities of prehispanic Ancestral Pueblo communities to climate change, I used behavioral geoarchaeological approaches to reconstruct the use-life histories of fifteen of these features at nine sites.

This scholarship contends that for colonizers, religious conversion was irrevocably connected to agricultural practice – a particular concern to Spaniards in the Andes given the strong links between agrarian production and Inka ritual practices. 
 Evidence from the site of Markaqocha, in the Cusco region of Peru, both corroborates and complicates arguments that link religious and ecological conversion. At Markaqocha, archaeological, historical, and paleo-environmental data provide a lens on Inka and Colonial ritual economies. These data suggest that while the intervention of religious organizations was critical to initial attempts to convert from an Inka to Spanish political ecology, the connections this process affirmed between ritual spaces and agricultural production later prompted conflict between secular and religious institutions. Further, data from Markaqocha suggest that attempts at such a conversion were not entirely successful. The data demonstrate that pre-Colonial and Catholic ritual practices have together influenced food production in the vicinity of the site through the five centuries since the arrival of colonizers in the region.

",Bronze Age,Zooarchaeology,Ritual and Symbolism,"Within recent years, feasting and other forms of ritual consumption have become more frequently identified in the archaeozoological record of the ancient Near East. Reasons for more frequent identification of ritual sacrifices and feasts vary, but two driving forces certainly are archaeological context, bones found in or near special architecture, and the cultural milieu formed by the region’s ancient textual record. In contrast, I have a skeptical tale to tell of ritual production and consumption. This tale takes place at the site of Hazor, a Bronze and Iron Age city mound in Israel. The site has all the correct elements to demonstrate ancient food-related rituals: It was a city of great size and importance; a place where excavations have revealed temples and/or impressive palaces, cuneiform texts and statues of gods; and which produced large bone assemblages. Yet archaeozoological analyses demonstrate a disjuncture between bone patterning on one hand and expectations set by texts and contexts on the other. The question is how to understand the bone debris left by Hazor’s elite: Does it represent the diet of uncharacteristically proletarian rulers and priests, or does the patterning present a cautionary tale about too much reliance on text and context?",3128,Symposium,Presenter,3128,Justin,Lev-Tov

",Other,Mortuary Analysis,Monumentality,"In eastern Africa, herding was the earliest form of food production, supplanting fishing-hunting-gathering around Lake Turkana (northwest Kenya) ca. 5000-4000 BP. Fueled by the dramatic recession of Lake Turkana 5300-3900 BP, which made fishing less predictable and exposed vast plains of rich pasture near the lake, early herding probably involved both in-migration of pastoralists and adoption of livestock by local fishers. As herding took hold a mortuary tradition developed, with megalithic ‘pillar sites’ serving as communal cemeteries. Construction (massive platforms, mortuary cavities >100m2 dug into sandstone bedrock, and columnar stones hauled up to 1 km from their source) and use (interment of several hundred estimated individuals over a few centuries, accompanied by adornments and intricately decorated pottery) attest to the sites’ commemorative significance. As physical landmarks and settings for unifying rituals, pillar sites would have anchored early herders within an otherwise fluid physical and social landscape as Lake Turkana retreated, rainfall diminished, and mobility increased. Periodic assembly of otherwise dispersed groups to perform ritualized interment would have facilitated diverse forms of social interaction—including information sharing, formation of exchange networks, and negotiations and strategic decisions about herd movements—essential to the success of early pastoral economies in eastern Africa.",3128,Symposium,Presenter,3128,Elisabeth,Hildebrand

The integration of Gujarat (India) into the interregional flows of people, goods, and ideas that knit together the Indus Civilization, for example, is associated with the widespread adoption of pastoralism in a region that was formerly characterized by small-scale horticulturalist-hunting communities.  Here, new data generated from recent faunal and isotopic studies are interpreted to infer the organization of pastoral production, circulation, and consumption.  While economic and ecological models offer valuable insights into the adoption and practice of pastoralism in Gujarat, a comprehensive understanding of this process must incorporate consideration of the possible roles that livestock, especially cattle, played in the ritual life of local communities.

Drawing on emerging archaeobotanical evidence from the Ravni Kotari region of southern Croatia, this paper discusses the challenges of understanding continuities of cultivation practices over multiple millennia in relation to changing political-economic contexts within which cultivation has taken place. I emphasize the production of Olea europea and Vitis vinifera, two non-subsistence crops that emerged as central components of market-oriented production under the Roman Empire, and continue to provide the basis of commercial agriculture in the region today. The long-term transmission of these cultivars is complex. The ritual use of wine and oil within the Christian church may have sustained the cosmological importance of these crops through the geopolitically turbulent medieval period, while their commercial importance diminished. More recently, viticulture and oleiculture have become emblematic of “traditional” folk life and agricultural heritage, their consumption ritualized in new ways through agritourism.

Food production, as a range of coordinated activities, is critical to the organization of society. Yet because it is necessary for survival, scholars often isolate it as a domain of domestic subsistence. Nonetheless, numerous ethnohistoric and modern accounts detail the important role that communal rituals had in organizing these activities, such as the intricate ritual-agricultural calendar of the Inka state or the elaborate water temple ceremonies in Bali. While these accounts articulate the sacred significance of food production practices and the collective rituals that organized them, these links are less commonly explored archaeologically. For example, although archaeologists often discuss the cultural meanings of consumption or the political economy of production-storage-redistribution cycles, few have addressed how rituals were perceived as essential to food production technologies. In turn, scholars often overlook how diverse kinds of labor, from ritual to food production, interlinked to organize ancient societies. By attending to these interconnections, papers in this symposium contribute to our anthropological knowledge of the complex practices that link people, plants, animals, land, water, and things and to address the imbrication of “sacred,” “community,” and “socioeconomic” landscapes and practices throughout the ancient world.",3128,Symposium,Chair (Primary),3128,Rebecca,Bria

El Huarco, de acuerdo a los relatos etnohistóricos fue un señorío fuerte e independiente, también es señalado como un señorío que formó parte de una confederación política conquistada por los incas. Las investigaciones arqueológicas priorizaron el análisis  estilístico; como consecuencia, su organización política, económica y cultural  se redujo estrictamente a un espacio geográfico determinado. 
Por ello, actualmente nos replanteamos la idea de cómo la costa centro-sur fue ocupada por uno o más grupos sociales en tiempos pre-incas y su posterior desarrollo bajo la dominación inca.

California Indians were removed from their homes, forced to perform labor, and were moved into poor living conditions that contributed to declines in health and the loss of many California Indian lives. The physical removal of California Indians from their homes was also an attempt by Spanish missionaries and soldiers to re-imagine the indigenous world. Under Mexican rule, California Indians were transferred to ranchos to perform labor in similarly poor conditions. And during the early years of California statehood in the 1860s, so-called “vagrant” laws enabled white settlers to enslave California Indians who were found “idle” on their lands. Despite these hardships necessitating great change in traditional lifeways, California Indians remained immersed in and connected to a broader Indigenous world in which colonial places and institutions were only one part. That is, California Indians refused to wholly accept settler boundaries, ownership, and ways of using traditional lands by trespassing on settler-designated private property to hold ceremonies and collect traditional resources.

Vizenor reminds us that his concept of the “post-indian” condition is often a study in the “simulation of absence,” in which the absence of “ontologically “real” persons that conform to the stereotype of Indians circulating in the hegemonic US culture, Native American people simulate those images (Vizenor and Lee 2003: 161), the “post-indian” being a subject willing to engage with and push the accepted boundaries of a stereotypical Indian identity (Vizenor and Lee 2003).

Its production in the Dinetah Region of New Mexico, during the late Seventeenth and early Eighteenth century place it in a time of Native resistance to Spanish colonization in Northern New Mexico.  This resistance, in the form of a pan-Indian uprising, the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, sets the stage in which the production of Gobernador Polychrome emerged and ceased.  This event, along with other contexts of colonization, influenced the practices of the Navajo people in this period.  While western science has painted the Navajo as recent immigrants to the SW, indigenous understandings of place and identity contradict this view.  For instance, an Indigenous braided model of interrelatedness does not fit with the theoretical bases of genetic and linguistic evidence, which favor dendritic models.

However, this does not always translate into engaging with indigenous and Native American studies theoretical perspectives in representing the results of research, even if the research itself was collaborative.

Western epistemological traditions and the institutionalization of these understandings of the world—the academy—have constructed ideological and physical dichotomies between nature and culture, pre-contact times and post-contact times, and tribal and colonial state boundaries. Archaeologists are in a unique position to engage multiple datasets and knowledges in partnership with tribal communities to challenge these deeply rooted settler claims to intellectual and physical spaces.

Theoretical perspectives from Native American studies can help decolonize archaeological narratives to show how indigenous peoples in contact with Europeans continue their entanglements with land, ancestors, traditions and values.

Results indicate that the Preclassic (1000 BC-AD 300) Maya of western Belize had diverse diets incorporating both maize and wild foods, which may have promoted resilience in the face of social reorganization and changing ecological systems at the end of the Preclassic period. During the Classic period (AD 300-900/1000), inter-individual isotopic variations indicate that high-status individuals had a narrow and highly specialized maize-based diet, which may have created a more vulnerable socio-economic system that disintegrated due in part to drought conditions during the Terminal Classic period.

",Neolithic,Zooarchaeology,Mobility,"First developing around 8,000 years ago, pastoralism in Africa has continued as a flexible and dynamic mode of subsistence. One key feature of this dynamism is mobility, which is crucial for many East African pastoralists today to access seasonally available pasture and water. In areas of unpredictable rainfall, mobile pastoralism permits more people to live in dry lands than do other subsistence strategies. How the earliest herders in Tanzania used the landscape is still relatively unknown. Recent excavations at Luxmanda provide detailed information about early pastoral lifeways in Tanzania. Situated at the southern edge of Tanzania’s Mbulu Plateau, Luxmanda is the earliest and most southern known Pastoral Neolithic site, thus providing an intriguing example of pastoral mobility strategies as herding initially took hold in Tanzania. We present the first isotopic analyses of ancient livestock in Tanzania. Carbon and oxygen stable isotope data from sequentially sampled cattle and caprine teeth provide a record of seasonal herding practices. Strontium isotopes clarify movements across distinct geologies, providing a nuanced picture of both herding over the seasonal round and possible livestock exchange among pastoral groups. Finally, these analyses throw more light on the nature of the spread of pastoralism in Africa.

As livestock production intensifies in in semi-arid regions there is a need to identify the diverse set of strategies employed by pastoralists. Sequential carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) isotope analysis of teeth from domesticated sheep at Bronze Age sites in Kazakhstan exhibit varied isotopic sequences. Sheep from Kent exhibit an inverse relationship where low δ18O values coincide with high δ13C values indicating that they ingested 13C-enriched graze during the winter season. This pattern is consistent with the foddering of caprines during the winter months when they are living in sheltered valleys near the site. In contrast, sheep from Turgen exhibit diverse isotopic sequences indicating variation in husbandry practices and landscape use.

While it is difficult to relate the numerous goats to the abundant olives at Azoria, our interdisciplinary study presents the opportunity to examine varied contexts. Deposition of plants remains happens largely before the meal is served while animals are largely deposited after dinner. Our analyses reveal that conspicuous storage and communal dining formed the backbone of the political structure at Azoria. The specific foodstuffs stored and consumed in civic buildings were much the same as those consumed in townhouses. However, the quantity and elaboration of foodstuffs within communal dining structures created a convivial community at Azoria.

Furthermore, the identification of neoformed minerals and their chemistry has enabled the detection of degradation products of human body tissue and probably also that of some of the associated cultural objects. The genesis of these minerals reflects the sequence of the opening and filling of the tomb and their identification, therefore, contributes to a more informed reconstruction of the history of the burial.

Here we present some insights based on paleopathology and collagen stable isotope analysis. 
This study (n = 275 individuals for Paphos; 94 individuals for Corinth) suggests populations that were under a certain amount of stress. Mean statures were relatively low, and rates of cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis suggest that periods of dietary deficiency were fairly common. 
Collagen stable isotope values were obtained for 34 humans and 17 comparative fauna from Corinth. Due to preservation issues, only six human values are available for Paphos. These are similar to those found for Corinth, suggesting a broadly similar diet at the two sites. Overall the human collagen values show a distinctive pattern of low δ13C and high δ15N compared to human values observed elsewhere in Greece. Carbon routing models and documentary evidence suggest that this pattern may reflect a largely grain- and oil-based diet whose modest protein component included marine products such as dried fish and garum.

Homer describes one helmet being passed through seven hands before finally ending up on the head of Odysseus. All this raises the question of why warriors did not make their own helmets. What was it about the production and ownership of these helmets that was so special? Why did this type of helmet develop a romantic and timeless reputation in art and stories? The assemblage of broken tusk refuse from Iklaina provides a unique opportunity to explore the techniques involved in the making of a helmet. Microscopy of tool marks and experiments on modern tusks will embellish the information we have on how the illustrious helmets were made.",3133,Symposium,Presenter,3133,Deborah,Ruscillo

The cemetery appears to be associated with a previously undocumented hospital, probably connected with the nearby church of St. Luke the Evangelist. The skeletons were found in rectangular rock-cut graves, all of which contained multiple burials. Two non-standard graves held multiple burials that had been placed in the cutting all at once. We interpret these as mass graves, associated with a catastrophic event, possibly the Justinianic plague. Other graves were used repeatedly, often with much of the upper bodies above the hips being removed prior to subsequent burials. 100% of the graves have multiple individuals with significant bone pathologies. The differential diagnosis of lesions suggests that leprosy was found in approximately 50% of the skeletons, supporting our interpretation that the cemetery is associated with a hospital or hospice.

Here, we consider the macrobotanical assemblage recovered through flotation of more than 7000 L of sediment at the site of Iklaina, in Messenia, in conjunction with microbotanical remains (starches, phytoliths) to illuminate cultural and natural site formation processes that have either negatively or positively affected plant preservation and recovery. We have observed three tentative patterns: the relative absence of materials in both natural and anthopogenic drainage areas, compounded by the downhill erosion of deposits leading to “shallow sites”; heavy clay content which is destructive for both micro- and macro-remains;  and the importance of dumping episodes in relatively undisturbed areas that had fallen out of active use. This combination of patterns means that where evidence is preserved, it is rarely in primary contexts that can be used to discuss active-use spaces. Instead, it is better suited to discussions of disposal processes that reflect general and cumulative near-by activities and long-term patterns of resource use. Nonetheless, extensive horizontal excavation at Iklaina has revealed intra-site variation perhaps related to administrative zones vs. combined-use domestic/industrial areas.

Histories of movement shape our perceptual apparatus and generate embodied knowledge. This recursive constitution of bodies, movements, and materials simultaneously defines the challenge and opportunity of phenomenological approaches within sensory archaeology. Explicitly or not, most researchers use their own bodily experiences of movement as analogies for making inferences about the material and sensory consequences of bodily movements in the past. As imitative learning produces shared embodied knowledge among craftspeople, likewise, archaeologists can engage with movements and materials to produce some degree of intersubjectivity with bodies in the past. Drawing from archaeological and ethnographic fieldwork in western Ireland, this paper will propose simple guiding premises for undertaking a sensory archaeology of movement. To illustrate these premises, I discuss the changing material settings and practices of Irish pilgrimage and pastoralism between the medieval and modern period.

",Bronze Age,Experimental Archaeology,Material Culture and Technology,"This paper explores the possibility to extract information about sensory experiences inherent in the material culture of ancient Egypt which are often overlooked due to the difficulty to track them in the material. By implementing new intellectual frameworks like New Materialism and the consequent application of methodologies from archaeology and anthropology we gain insight in the actions of ancient bodies. 
Taking inspiration from Latour’s actants (2005), Barad’s agential realism (2007) and Bennett’s thing power (2010) – relating the potential of agency to materials and objects in human lives – the study discusses the physical relationship of material objects and the human body. With the additional help of experimental and experiential archaeology as well the focus on hitherto neglected objects we not only can bring the objects but also senses in the past to life. 
This is explored using unpublished headrests from Cyfarthfa Castle Museum by looking on the intersection of bodies with the material that also could be interpreted as inter-material communication. Impressions of fabric on their wooden surface are presumably the imprint of bedding intended to ensure comfortable sleep telling us about the sensual experience using these artefacts. The contact between skin and rough wood needed to be alleviated.",3139,Symposium,Presenter,3139,Katharina,Zinn

",Bronze Age,Other,Ritual and Symbolism,"Shang (c. 1600 – 1046 BCE) elites were expert manipulators of soundscape. The intimacy of the relationship between music and authority during Bronze Age China has been well established, bronze bells having served as crucial markers of status and political prestige. Before the codification of the ritual orchestra, however, and beyond the performance of “music” per se, soundscapes were defined by factors such as climate and local ecological context, by animals, by the noise of human activity at large. As early as the Shang, soundscape was a defining component of the Chinese habitus, evidenced by the prevalence of birds imagery in ornamentation as well as the rich array of noisemakers. This paper argues that Shang elites – and particularly ritual experts –  wielded knowledge of local auditory contexts and utilized noisemakers such as rattles and jades in order to mediate between man, nature, and the ancestors. The resolution of natural cacophony through the orchestration of soundscape is an integral part of social evolution, or if one prefers, urban planning. Exploring Shang soundscapes is an opportunity to bridge scientific and humanistic approaches by combining analysis of the ecological record as well as man-made objects.",3139,Symposium,Presenter,3139,Kirie,Stromberg

Without moving beyond the material remains and into the realm of the self-reflexive researcher (Hamilakis 2013: 119), this paper will demonstrate that archaeologists do not need to stray too far from their traditional methods to uncover rich evidence of past sensory lives. By drawing from the field of art history and linguistics, the elaborate depictions of tomb scenes from Eighteenth dynasty Egypt might truly come to life as evidence for an ancient sensory framework. In addition, these tomb scenes were not designed for the dead, but also engaged with by the living. Though these scenes were augmented by their inclusion of deceased people and other such occurrences not commonly visible to the living, the activities depicted such as banqueting or hunting were those experienced by ancient Egyptians every day. How might the visible representations of invisible sensory experiences in these scenes be reconciled with the daily life of the ancient Egyptians?

During this period, a state society emerged in the Ayacucho Valley and expanded across Peru. Even before the emergence of this state, however, culture contact of the Ayacucho heartland had already started with some remote regions in the late part of the Early Intermediate Period (EIP). This far-reaching contact would have gradually been intensified toward the beginning of the MH. Indeed, such cultural influence can be seen in Ayacucho ceramics during this transition. One good example is an EIP Ayacucho ceramic style known as ""Cruz Pata."" It has been pointed out that this particular style bears the first indication of south coast influence of the Nasca culture. Despite being important, the Cruz Pata style has been poorly defined in the literature, and it has yet to be investigated more fully so that we can better understand the arrival of Nasca influence and its ensuing impact upon the emergence of the Huari state.

In the 2017 excavations we used methods designed to expose the upper portions of walls, in order to define architectural spaces and clarify organization of the sector. Some architectural spaces were excavated more completely, fully exposing walls and architectural features.

Our excavations revealed distinct architectural styles defined by differences in scale, construction materials, and construction techniques. Analysis shows clear linkages and relationships between structures with distinct architectural styles that are maintained across time. Differences in construction materials and techniques are frequently understood to indicate distinctions in the use and purpose of buildings, and differences in who could use those buildings. Our findings at Huari challenge these assumptions, showing that finely constructed buildings and spaces with distinct architectural features were at times integrated with more quotidian architecture.

This research synthesizes results of isotopic analysis of human skeletons from the cemetery of Uraca, in the Majes Valley, and describes the artifact assemblage recovered. The data presented will demonstrate that the individuals interred at the site were linked to material and ideological traditions of Nasca and other desert and coastal valleys through mortuary practices and violent trophy-head taking, while there is only limited evidence that they emulated Wari material culture or tapped into Middle Horizon trade networks.

We investigate in particular how the echoes of the Middle Horizon resonate in the genesis of the Late Intermediate Ica culture that emerged here thereafter. We present evidence that H-8 was first founded at this time (c. 1000CE), and operated as a caravanserai within an intensifying network of trade and exchange articulated by camelid caravans between a number of Ica Valley sites throughout the LIP. Lyon (1966) argues that the beginning of the LIP was marked by a revival of Middle Horizon iconography, suggesting particular cultural or political value of this period to the people of Ica. Moreover, the remote oracle/pilgrimage center of Pachacamac on the central coast appears to have exerted particularly powerful influence on Ica during the Middle Horizon, but also thereafter on the developing regional culture in Ica. This poorly understood relationship with the central coast may have had a pivotal role in the development and rise to power of the Ica people during the subsequent LIP period.",3143,Symposium,Presenter,3143,Sara,Morrisset

However, the relationship was not a simple, unilineal one with Wari the dominant core society and Nasca the passive peripheral society. Instead a bilateral relationship developed in which many things were shared between the two. Wari colonies and foreigners are found in Nasca, along with changes in local settlements, new mortuary practices, and new long-distance prestige goods. Many aspects of Nasca culture were incorporated by Wari including ceramic technology, iconography, flexed burial positions, and trophy head taking.

As the number of such corridors increase and intertwine, a network is formed on the landscape that many past empires, including—we believe—the Wari, augmented with considerable imperial investment. By constricting the number of reasonable overland routes, mountainous terrain can concentrate such imperial infrastructure along those natural corridors that simultaneously advance imperial interests (e.g., connecting allied or conquered territories while isolating others) and are suitable to the type of travel (e.g., messengers, trade caravans, armies, etc.) required to meet particular administrative, political, or economic needs. This paper reports recent results from continued research on the Wari presence in the headwaters region of the Nasca drainage in southern Ayacucho and interrogates these data though the lens of network imperial interaction.",3143,Symposium,Presenter,3143,Matt,Edwards

Archaeologists have recreated daily life for people living in these places, producing many insightful studies of Tiwanaku diet, cultural bodily modifications, disease, and occasional incidents of trauma. Many colonists living far from the Tiwanaku heartland developed hybrid lifestyles, adopting some local practices while preserving other Tiwanaku traditions. The site Cundisa is located in modern-day Copacabana, approximately 60km across Lake Wiñaymarka and 90km over land from Tiwanaku. Cundisa includes a cemetery with Middle Horizon burials of 100+ individuals. While the majority of individuals were buried with Tiwanaku ceramics, isotopic and skeletal evidence suggests variation in geographic origin and lifestyles for the people buried here. In this paper, we present the results of preliminary skeletal analyses of diet, disease, trauma, and identity for these individuals and suggest the variation present in the sample indicates interregional connections between Copacabana, Tiwanaku, and the coast.

Our field excavations in 2012 and 2015 revealed a long-standing tradition of mortuary treatment that persisted even after the arrival of the Wari in the area.  While many components of this tradition appear to have originated locally, other components closely parallel Nazca populations, including patterns of trauma, funerary ritual and the presence of “trophy heads”.   The collective nature of the burials suggests the inclusion of both sexes, and all age groups.  Interestingly, we have detected a form of secondary burial for neonates and infants.  Our data suggest that many of them were not buried at the time of death, but rather at a later time, positioned next to adult women.  In this context, we argue that the Ramada mortuary tradition in the Vitor Valley was part of a long-standing practice that remained remarkably unchanged despite co-habitation of the Valley with altiplano populations, and that promoted ongoing communication between the living and the dead. These collective burials may point to social and/or biological units that were perpetuated even after dead.

Here we compare plant remains with human skeletal remains to understand dietary practices at Tenahaha in the Cotahuasi Valley (AD 850-1050). Tenahaha was built during the Middle Horizon as a communal space to take advantage of new social interaction spheres, stimulated in part by the Wari state. Tenahaha includes burial areas as well as food storage and preparation zones. Macrobotanical remains were found in public rather than private locations, indicating communal production of food and drink. Quinoa, tubers, and molle were ubiquitous at the site, along with maize, with chicha made of maize/molle produced and consumed there. These remains suggest a ritual or communal diet heavy in C3 foods, although taphonomy and food processing will also be considered as mediating factors. In comparison, stable isotope analysis of individuals buried at the site compare favorably to the elite inhabitants of the Wari secondary city of Conchopata, who ate a diet dominated by C4 plants (maize) and meat (maize foddered camelids).

I investigate the 19th century landscape and material culture of indentured laborers on the Bras d'Eau sugar estate in northeastern Mauritius, Indian Ocean. After emancipation, indentured laborers lived and worked within the same physical plantation landscapes as the enslaved individuals who came before them. However, Asian indentured laborers in Mauritius were immigrants and migrants: one-third returned to their homeland at the end of their 5-year contracts and the other two two-thirds remained on the island and eventually became the demographic majority. In spite of the relatively shallow period of occupation in Bras d’Eau, indentured laborers left a material imprint on the landscape. Mapping and excavations of industrial building, laborers’ barracks, houses, and courtyards revealed possible Southeast Asian roots in the spatial organization of the living quarter and artifacts of mixed Asian, Indian and European origins. To better understand this particular context of unfree labor, I bring Patterson's conception of ""slavery as social death"" into conversation with literatures on transnational identities and migrations. These two theoretical perspectives frame indentured laborers’ material practices as the processes of social life that emerge out of processes of social death.",3145,Symposium,Presenter,3145,Julia,Haines

Eltis and Richardson's Routes to Slavery. Direction, Ethnicity and Mortality in the Transatlantic Slave Trade marked the first flowering of a hugely ambitious project to synthesise archival data on known Transatlantic slave trading voyages from c.1500-1900. The resultant database is now widely used by archaeologists in both Africa and the Americas. But there were many other routes to slavery in different times and in other places: not least the many routes which brought millions of enslaved persons to ancient Rome and its provinces in the Classical era. Can archaeological work on forced migration, ethnicity and ethnogenesis in the early modern world really inform research centred on the Roman Republic and Empire? Yes it can, as this paper aims to show.

While the French philosopher was concerned with political freedom rather than freedom in the context of slavery, Sartre’s words offer lessons for analyzing a vast spectrum of how individuals experienced the conditions of slavery and freedom. This paper explores an ambitious project of freedom and future-making initiated by a group of Barbadians one generation after emancipation in the English Caribbean. In 1865 the Cora landed in Liberia in order for free Afro-Barbadians to assist in the “civilizing” process already underway in the nation. We offer some preliminary thoughts on the material signatures of slavery and freedom observed in Crozierville, the small town established by the Barbadians. The Barbadian settlement in Liberia came to exhibit some of the attributes of the colonial society of their homeland that had been dominated by slavery just 30 years earlier. While the “Love of Liberty” brought Barbadians to Liberian shores, semblances of slavery are still visible on the social and physical landscape, highlighting the fragility of freedom in addition to the complexities of freedom-making for Africans and people of African descent on both sides of the Atlantic.",3145,Symposium,Presenter,3145,Matthew,Reilly

Whether or not enslaved peoples were deliberately bred systematically to produce children for sale by the master is a topic that has been generally neglected in modern scholarship. This practice demonstrates the inherent inhumanity of slavery and is an example of what the scholar Orlando Patterson describes as “the gendered nature of slavery”. Women and children were often the most exploited as a result of their sexuality, a practice that has continued today in the modern era. The Works Progress Administration’s Slave Narratives present multiple firsthand accounts of the prevalence of this abhorrent practice in the United States. There is reason to believe that there may have been a breeding plantation among the properties of the Lloyd family, the owners of Wye House Plantation.

Sophisticated analyses of slave burials that combine the physical elements of burial grounds, coffins, and grave goods, with the biology and chemical signatures of the human remains, can identify and source first-generation slaves, and help to infer the social bonds reflected in their burial.
Orlando Patterson has defined slavery as “social death” to reflect the nature and impact of forced translocation and cultural depletion. Unassailable as this might seem at first glance,  recent work in underclass burial grounds at the Cape and elsewhere, challenge this deathly pronouncement  by suggesting that slaves from a multiplicity of foreign homelands were incorporated into a vibrant community of free and unfree people and who nurtured them beyond their short life into the long comfort of death. This finding casts a new light on the historical records to reveal  the permeable nature of slave society in the wider colonial world.

This trend was equally true in the Izalcos region of colonial Guatemala, what is today western El Salvador. This region was a crucial center in the developing trans-colonial economy because of its early leading role in the production of cacao, the tree whose seed is the main ingredient for chocolate. Because of the extraordinary place of the Izalcos in this colonial moment, the region experienced intense social, political, and economic pressures. One expression of colonial anxiety was the development of a social classification system known as castizaje. While some casta terms are part of the sixteenth-century vocabulary, the system of castas was not systematic until the eighteenth century. Censuses and other documentary evidence indicate that discrete barrios in Izalcos region towns were mostly Afro-Central Americans.

Ambiguous early terminology was tied to an imagined body of difference often focused on skin color, or colorism. Intimate relationships of blood mixing made it also fluid and opportunistic; the concept of caste retracted, stretched, and grew according to circumstance, eventually merging with the concept of race as it developed in the 18th and early 19th century. People constructed difference through the built environment, especially regarding by affecting mobility and invisibility, the selective use of kinds of ecologies (swamps, caves), urban space, and through bodies themselves.

My goals are to: determine factors contributing to safe/unsafe fieldwork environments; determine best practices and effective ways to implement them; develop standards, policies, protocols and trainings to educate excavators about relevant ethics and laws for field and research projects; and, under ASOR’s auspices, provide all excavators with much-needed information.

Private consulting firms contract with federal agencies to assist in compliance with federal laws such as NHPA, NAGPRA, ARPA and AHPA, and additional state laws. As contract archaeologists, we often work extended periods within small groups in isolated areas, which lends to work environments away from support systems of family and friends. Co-workers depend on each other for safety and support in more intimate environments than non-field work. This intimate nature of our work environment often permits lines between professional/formal relationships and personal relationships to blur. Consequently, individual behaviors, intentional or not, can result in uncomfortable and/or un-safe work environments. Field conditions can provide a context in which civil rights and Title IX can inadvertently be lost. In addition, the small, isolated nature of the group can act as a deterrent to speaking out against harassment or discrimination. I argue that CRM firms need to prioritize Title IX to the same degree as other federal laws that govern our work.

All of these avenues allow the public to interact directly with archaeologists quickly and regularly, keeping them abreast of new discoveries and inform them of what archaeology is really like.

Not only do they allow us to track social and ecological changes anchored in space, the repeated tending to such places set in motion historical path dependencies for descendent communities. However, at the human scale persistence is never a taken for granted, but is produced by the projects of communities who incorporate places into daily, commemorative, and cosmological frameworks. Because places are multi-temporal and relational, they persist in their being enmeshed in associations between persons, ecologies, places, and historical narratives; the linkages between which are subject to transformations as communities attend to present concerns and try to assure futures. The hard work of keeping places from becoming impersistent is immanent in the genealogies of terraformed landscapes of the middle St. Johns River in northeast Florida. There, over the course of nine millennia, hunter-gatherer communities manipulated old places and created new locations for daily living and cosmological reverence.

A great deal of attention has been focused on the shifting functions of mounds during Terminal Woodland / Emergent Mississippian times, when platform mound-and-plaza complexes become commonplace, corn agriculture becomes the norm, and higher levels of institutionalized status differentiation develop. In this paper, I define this transition as a “temporal frontier” and interrogate the effects of the period’s marginal position on its archaeological interpretation. In particular, I draw attention to the distorting effect of archaeology’s backward gaze in examining the changes that take place at temporal frontiers and advocate for a more forward-looking approach to the interpretation of these pivotal moments. My primary case study focuses on the Late Woodland Coles Creek culture (AD 700 – 1200) of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the interpretation of early platform mounds. Finally, I briefly consider how the concept of temporal frontiers may be used to better comprehend the archaeology of other transitional periods in United States prehistory.

The Marroquín collapse of 1786 claimed hundreds of indigenous lives, and symbolized the late 18th century decline of Spanish governance in the Viceroyalty of Peru. While this disaster may appear to be a singular event, this paper argues that understanding the causes and consequences of this collapse requires an investigation of how three different temporal scales (geological, institutional, and quotidian) articulated with one another.

However, over two millennia of human activity are inscribed upon this landscape and make it an excellent case-study for understanding the construction of a frontier landscape over the longue durée.

At what points may the anthropogenic landscape depart from the natural in being identified as a “frontier”? What processes may affect such departures?

Exploring the implications of this historical materialist approach involves linking processes operating at different scales of time, and tracing historical genealogies of practice and the ways they were assembled to produce political sovereignty. I argue that not only are the conditions for sovereignty necessarily in place long before the emergence of particular regimes, but that the production and maintenance of these kinds of social relations are rooted in material culture over the longue durée. Research conducted at Minaspata, a multicomponent site located in the Lucre Basin, Cuzco, Peru, in the heartland of the Inca state, suggests that the emergence of Inca imperialism in the 14th-15th century CE was the result of a complex set of social relations, materialities, cultural practices, and ontologies that were “assembled” over the previous several centuries.

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers,"Searching for the origin points of major cultural revolutions and transitions has long been a driver of archaeological research, yet led to research focused on perceived boundaries, rather than continuity. Research into the origins of so-called modern human behavior, the origins of social complexity, the earliest domesticates, among others, all focus on defining moments of change that may be undetectable in the archaeological record. Perhaps some of the most enduring archaeological questions revolve around the ‘origins of agriculture’. In this paper, we explore changing historical conceptions of the ‘origins of agriculture’ in Southwest Asia in archaeological discourse and how, through the lens of the longue durée, we can trace aspects of material culture, human action, and complex human-landscape dynamics in deep time. Using examples from the Epipalaeolithic of eastern Jordan, we address current debates on Neolithization by exploring the implications of perspectives that focus on ‘becoming’ Neolithic and ‘being’ a hunter-gatherer. Through this perspective we discuss different scales of material culture analysis; from the ‘ethnographic’ lens identifying individual behaviors in the past, to the longue durée of material culture trends.

A variety of new groups emerged during the Bronze Age in the Carpathian Basin —some had powerful rulers holding feasts and controlling the trade in commodities, and some were egalitarian peoples leaving little evidence for social differentiation outside of age and gender. This paper uses a comparative and multi-scalar perspective to study two different social trajectories in the Carpathian Basin during the second millennium BC: the Lower Körös Basin in Eastern Hungary, and the Danube and its tributaries in Central Hungary. We begin with coarse-grained chronological settlement data and consider the importance of foundational differences in population in both regions. We then look at the productive catchment and yearly agricultural needs of settlements, and weigh their likely importance in decision-making at the household level. Finally, we address how geographic location and compounding trade interests over successive generations potentially influenced the changing relationships between people and communities in the Körös and Central Danube regions in the second millenium BC.

Following key post-structuralist insights, we argue that the contents of these histories are not internal to the human mind, nor to abstract ideological structures, but are produced through embodied practices that mobilize material objects and leave material traces, whether those traces be ceramic sherds, architectural remains, or bureaucratic documents. As such, archaeology is poised to not only engage with critical theoretical discussions in the social sciences but also to impact to our understanding of the “long now” of the present.

Specifically, the use of microartifacts and micromorphology in conjunction with analysis of excavated artifacts allow one to piece together site formation processes and material patterns that relate to specific activities. A case study utilizing Hawaiian house sites exemplifies this approach. The case study presented here analyzes data from 16th century house complexes, a time when daily practices were developing in ways not reflected in the (later) ethnohistories. However, this paper illustrates that utilizing complimentary micro and macro artifact analytical methods allows for a reconstruction of daily practices by comparing the data with the ethnohistorically-derived predictive models.

Archaeological discourse has largely shifted away from addressing long-term change and continuity, instead exploring human society in narrower slices of “ethnographic” time, with only superficial reference to larger time scales. This is partly a reaction to earlier examinations of large-scale or long-term change, which frequently produced deterministic explanations that reduced or ignored human agency, or was unable to explain how different time scales articulated with each other. 

Yet this “ethnographic” approach has its own problems, and risks reconstructing archaeological “subjects” in ways that reinforce the divide between mind and matter, interiority and exteriority, or subject and object. How can archaeologists reinstate the “deep-time” perspective as one of archaeology’s greatest contributions to broader human knowledge? How could we turn to back to the longue durée in a way that addresses why people turned away from it in the first place? What should be the actual subject of archaeological history? How do objects, landscapes, materials, and other non-human entities contribute to deep histories?

The paper contends that their Recuay findings emerged largely out of collections work, ethnohistory and close analysis of objects and ‘artworks’.  Notably, field archaeology had little to do with their intellectual legacy on Recuay; rather it was won through ambitious visual arguments and analogies, and expressed most saliently by their use of illustrations in a ‘visual archaeology.’",3154,Symposium,Presenter,3154,George,Lau

In 1954, newlywed archaeologists Francis Allen “Fritz” Riddell and Dorothy Menzel arrived in the Acari Valley on the south coast of Peru with the purpose of investigating the site of Tambo Viejo as part of the Inca Royal Highway Project directed by Victor von Hagen. Various sites in the region were recorded and investigated. After retirement in the early 1980s, Fritz was drawn back to Peruvian archaeology. With the California Institute of Peruvian Studies, projects involving Peruvian and foreign archaeologists, as well as non-professional participants from Acari and abroad, revisited sites and investigated new findings.  Fritz was concerned about the destruction of sites that had been recorded in the 1950s so he worked with local officials and citizens to encourage preservation. Rescue excavations were carried out at Tambo Viejo. Materials from looted sites were recovered, catalogued and stored. Though he passed away in 2002, Francis A. Riddell’s legacy endures in the Acari museum that has been named after him and in continuing work at the site of Tambo Viejo.

These Africans served apprenticeship periods of six to sixteen years, at the end of which they were to be free. Archival documents and archaeological evidence suggest that these indentured Africans were able to maintain a stronger African cultural identity as they settled into their new lives in these tiny islands in the Americas. However, an 18th century black cemetery in Nassau indicates that, long before this population of ‘unacculturated’ Africans were being settled in the Bahamas, earlier communities such as this one were devising means for allowing members of their communities to express and maintain their African cultural identity.

The impact of “Kormantse” as a cultural entity on the interpretations of the formation and transformations of the African Diaspora remains a major challenge among academics as many questions about the origins, migration episodes of populations, events and the process(es) involved remain unanswered. While bio-anthropologists explore DNA evidence, using various techniques of sequencing for possibly identifying common African ancestral connections or relationships, the need to review various routes and sources of the migrations, as well as the associated historical circumstances and places continue to be very critical. This presentation examines selected maps and other related documentation for speculating about the possible origins or combination of origins and routes that may have triggered off or played various roles in the processes of the creation of what we often consider today as “Kormantse in the African Diaspora.”  Maps of selected slave trade and migration routes are reviewed against the backdrop of selected recent speculations and interpretations of “Kormantse” in the history and culture of the African Diaspora.

",Historic,Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology,Communities of Practice,"Incipient aspects of syncretic processes among Africans and Europeans had begun on the African continent from the fifteenth century, with a particular reference noted for religious practices. Considering the relatively isolated participation of the two groups within the early interactive sphere of West Africa, as well as the in-situ contexts of the African cultures, some syncretical expressions were evident, yet due to the disproportional ratio of populations, were more subtle on the continent. However, once the various African populations were forcibly transported to the Caribbean, eliminating a strong homogeneity of cultural traditions, the degree of interactive exchange between Africans and Europeans increased dramatically, resulting in more complex and open forms of syncretism. This presentation seeks to provide a discussion of how African-European syncretic processes manifested themselves in successful forms, such as with benign cognitive compromises relating to religious practices, as well as how these syncretic processes were also rejected, such as with conflictive cognitive aspects in forms of aesthetic expression. It is proposed here that variable degrees of syncretical effectiveness were based on the fundamental variation of African and European cognitive approaches, with two archaeological case studies presented, one of successful syncretism and another rejected syncretism on St. Maarten.

In the specific context of the Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition, the notion of acculturation has usually been considered as a unidirectional, one-size-fits-all social mechanism to explain both the appearance of transitional industries and the disappearance of Neanderthals. However, considering the growing genetic evidence of sustained interbreeding between distinct hominin populations during the Pleistocene, it is likely that interpopulation interactions were more fluid and dynamic than often assumed under the acculturation scenario. To account for this, we present here a review of the notion of acculturation and the likely archaeological manifestations of its different forms. We then compare this against the archaeological record of Western Europe in order to demonstrate how a more nuanced and ethnographically-grounded approach to the notion of acculturation is needed in order to properly model and ultimately make sense of the full variety of human experiences in that critical moment of our evolutionary past.",3156,Symposium,Presenter,3156,Julien,Riel-Salvatore

Due largely to the plethora of scenarios produced by genetic and genomic data in the last few years, the demand for archaeological confirmation or refutation of diverse dispersal scenarios has increased. Yet our understanding of lithic assemblages is not sufficiently nuanced to answer these questions. This is compounded by research bias in some of the places of likely contact between multiple species/metapopulations, such as Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia. We review the history of key definitional concepts, such as Levallois and prepared-core technology, blades and bladelets, as well as retouch intensity and tool diversity in the context of shifting fossil identities of their makers. We ponder the effect of ecology, taphonomy, and function in determining our studiable units, and propose that the answer to separating populations probably depends on multiple lines of evidence that preserve different life ways rather than individual strands of material culture.

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Material Culture and Technology,"The eastern African Early Pleistocene witnessed critical shifts in climate, environment, hominin anatomy and behavior. The lithic record shows change within this broader context. After 1.8 Ma, Large Cutting Tools (LCTs), such as bifaces, entered the hominin lithic repertoire. These artifacts are widely viewed as the first evidence of lithic shaping. Many archaeologists theorize both cognitive and practical differences between “flaking” and “shaping” among knapping strategies. Most of these cognitive models are based on our current understanding of living human cognition, not that of Early Pleistocene hominins. Little empirical evidence supports these concepts’ usefulness for Early Pleistocene archaeology and the study of hominin cognitive evolution. Further, we often lack holistic information about non-LCT components of Early Acheulean lithic assemblages. Early LCTs, and associated non-LCT lithics, occur in the Kokiselei Site Complex in West Turkana, Kenya (1.8 – 1.76 Ma). This project fills a gap in the empirical research necessary for testing hypotheses about “shaping” and LCT emergence through holistic technological analyses of both LCT and non-LCT lithics at Kokiselei and an experimental program that investigates the knapping strategies employed by hominins at Kokiselei.

In turn this improves our capability to create a link between a stone tool’s archaeological context and geological area of origin. This connection is often discussed in terms of hominin behaviour, such as organisation of subsistence, adaptation to environment, and forward planning. However, the growing body of data provided by provenance research raises the need to critically assess how this information practically translates into proxies of hominin behaviour. This question is particularly prescient when considering the efficacy of raw material studies in exploring the lives of archaic Homo, in this case Homo neanderthalensis. Middle Palaeolithic foraging behaviour has historically been seen as ‘non-curated’, lacking a depth of planning and adaptive response to dynamic environments (e.g. Binford 1979; 1982). However, recent advances in our understanding of Neanderthals, suggest a species capable of complex subsistence behaviour, such as transport and curation. This paper discusses raw material acquisition strategies, and how profiles of raw material variability through time and space can contribute to developing models of Neanderthal behaviour.",3156,Symposium,Presenter,3156,Josie,Mills

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Material Culture and Technology,"Hallam Movius proposed that the Lower Palaeolithic cultures of East Asia and SE Asia were derived from a different cultural trajectory than that of Europe and Africa. The chopper-chopping tool complex of East and SE Asia was argued to be more primitive in many aspects. The type-site assemblages of the Pacitanian and Tampanian cultures are two out of only five assemblages that Movius initially used to define the chopper-chopping tool complex. The Pacitanian was first discovered by Michael Tweedie of the Raffles Museum, Singapore, and Gustav von Koenigswald in 1935 in the Pacitan Regency of Java. Three years later, a scientific team, including Movius, travelled to Java to investigate Tweedie and von Koenigswald’s findings. Also in 1938, Michael Tweedie’s colleague at the Raffles Museum, H. D. Collings, published  an article in Nature announcing a discovery of a similar archaeological assemblage in Malaysia that he named the Tampanian. This presentation provides a reassessment of the original Pacitanian and Tampanian assemblages that are still held in Singapore, highlighting reduction strategies that have been overlooked since the 1930’s and how the postcolonial history of scientific research in Singapore coupled with the dominance of Movius’s analysis may have led to this oversight.",3156,Symposium,Presenter,3156,David,Clinnick

",Paleolithic,Other,Social and Political Organization,"Social emotions are central to human social lives, however whilst there has been much discussion about archaic human cognition in terms of analytical capacities, capacities in terms of social emotions are rarely discussed. A 'null hypothesis' of a lack of pro-social motivations is often assumed to be the most rational scientific perspective on how archaic humans felt towards each other. Over recent years accumulating evidence for complex social relationships in archaic humans argues against this null hypothesis however, leaving the issue of archaic human social emotions open to debate. Here we consider how to approach an understanding of capacities for social emotions in archaic species, reflecting on how social emotions are likely to have evolved and developing an evolutionary and cultural model of capacities for social emotions in archaic humans.

Seventeenth century colonial chroniclers repeatedly mention a series of places and objects that surrounded political negotiations and efforts at alliance-building by Powhatan societies. While regional scholarship has focused on competition over subsistence resources, regional trade dynamics, and the regulated exchange of “prestige goods” as central to the development of these political structures, we shift the focus toward the engagement between these societies and specific places and objects whose enduring legacies spanned multiple generations. We argue that the development of the seventeenth century political geography was predicated on the maintenance of persistent ritualized spaces and the circulation of enduring objects whose shifting meanings connected the past and present, bolstered political structures, and facilitated the transfer of power from one generation to the next. Archaeological evidence indicates that shell and copper adornment objects entered the region during the thirteenth century, coinciding with the first appearance of palisade architecture, and the development of intentionally constructed ritual landscapes that served to create individual community identities, while at the same time drawing communities into a cross-regional political system.",3158,Symposium,Presenter,3158,Christopher,Shephard

This may take the form of illuminating historical silences, and for those archaeologists working in post-contact or colonial contexts this often means working with indigenous groups seeking governmental or popular recognition. In this paper, we explore our collaborative efforts to discover and characterize archaeological sites dating to the early historic era in the territory of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo people in central California.  Approved by the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, this research is explicitly designed to counter prevailing misunderstandings about the impacts of the Spanish mission system and subsequent iterations of settler colonialism, which are usually viewed as projects that eliminated native landholdings and cultural knowledge. Through the use of historic documents, early maps, ethnographic data, and targeted archaeological fieldwork, we are illuminating a complex refugium along Tomales Bay that sustained native people during the first century after the arrival of Europeans to the region. We will discuss the challenges and opportunities of our research in light of the emerging concern for pragmatism in archaeology.",3160,Symposium,Presenter,3160,Lee,Panich

While the discipline may congratulate itself for finally finding a way out of the twin traps of Enlightenment dualism and the humanism which underpins neoliberal geopolitics, we concomitantly run the risk of becoming even less relevant to society at large at a time when global conflicts are widely understood through the lens of competing and contested identities. Such identities are often framed as rooted in archaeological pasts as much mythical as material, but no less efficacious in the present.

First, what are the discourses and rhetorics of heritage—how is heritage invoked and talked about, like a sign of history, in making statements about the world? How has that shifted over time, as the term is increasingly invoked to explain and defend a wide range of actions and attitudes, and how do the different discursive communities who speak about heritage engage (or not) with one another? Most importantly, why have these discursive transformations not been accompanied by similar transformations in policy? The answer to that last question requires us to consider a second mode of heritage, namely, what does heritage do, as a sign in history, when it is invoked, encountered, and circulated? What does heritage activate, and what are its “practical effects”? Drawing on several examples including the recent removal of confederate monuments in the US, I argue that while operating in these two modes—as signs of and in history—heritage’s greatest potential for transformational change is when it ceases acting as a rhetorical device and instead becomes itself the center of experiential social action, such as through its encounter, circulation, or being made visible (or invisible).",3160,Symposium,Presenter,3160,Alexander,Bauer

However, recent investigations that focus more on human-environment interactions and domestic economies reveal a more dynamic and varied past in micro-regions of Eurasia. Pastoral strategies dating to the 3rd-2nd millennium BCE were regionally diverse, and societies were engaged in contacts that extended beyond the steppe world confines. These new discoveries bring material assemblages back into focus with the fresh purpose of scientifically examining the spectrum of technologies and social dynamics that generated the materiality of Eurasian pastoralism.

The chain of mountains that stretches across Central Asia constitutes a geographical obstacle that slowed down the dispersal process. Special strategies of adaptation to high altitude regions were requires not only by humans, but also by plants that came along due to changes in season length, climatic conditions, UV intensity and other. Therefore, the mountain regions acted as geographical filters that influenced what plant species and their varieties gets dispersed to further regions of Eurasia. The territory of Kyrgyzstan (almost 90% of the territory lies above 1900 masl) constitutes a key area for the study of crop and animal adaptation strategies, as the filtering effect on plant and animal selection by communities here would have been the most distinct.

Recent research demonstrates that broomcorn and foxtail millet (both C4 plants) were the key staple food in this region during the third and second millennium BC, but it remains unclear to what degree humans also relied on animal protein. Here we closely examine the dietary importance of grains and meat at several sites in western China from this period. We compare previous bulk collagen stable isotope results with compound specific carbon isotope analyses of individual amino acids extracted from human and animal bone collagen. Because essential and non-essential amino acids reflect different components of diet, compound specific carbon isotope analysis offers a means to isotopically distinguish between protein and non-protein dietary components, making it possible to determine to what degree humans were consuming meat directly versus consuming animals that were fed millet.

Drawing from numerous methodologies including ethnoarchaeology, geoarchaeology, zooarcaheology, archaeobotany and isotope studies, we explore the recurrent themes of foothill locations of early settlers in the context of the trans-Eurasian exchange.

Since the development and release of the model, numerous surveys have been performed across the state, and many new prehistoric archaeological sites have been identified and mapped. During the 2016 and 2017 summers, undergraduate and graduate archaeology students participating the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation’s ESTI (Engineering, Scientific, and Technical Internship) program tested the efficacy and accuracy of the model. The 2016 interns mapped 132 phase 1 survey report results, locations and associated data into Pennsylvania’s Cultural Resources Geographic Information System (CRGIS), and subsequently conducted analysis with this new data. In 2017, the interns concentrated on new phase 1 survey and Pennsylvania Archaeological Site Survey (PASS) site data from eight counties: Erie, Delaware, Lancaster, Berks, Bucks, Chester, Lehigh, and Cumberland. While the conclusions we have reached in this paper are preliminary and will require more years of analysis to fully understand, they reveal several interesting trends in cultural resource management (CRM) archaeological testing methods and model accuracy in different topographic regions of the state.",3165,Symposium,Presenter,3165,Clare,Farrow

Most state specifications for cultural resources surveys require floodplains to be geomorphically evaluated in order to identify buried landscapes. This is most frequently accomplished via trenching, an effective, but timely, costly, and sometimes destructive method. This project reports on an alternative technique utilizing a multi-proxy methodology coupling geophysical survey with auger sampling. These non-invasive and limited-impact methods produce accurate results without causing extensive destruction to cultural resources. The study area, located along Loyalhanna Creek in Westmoreland County in western Pennsylvania, is managed by the US Army Corps of Engineers – Pittsburgh District (USACE). As a federal agency, the USACE is mandated to identify and preserve cultural resources by Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Unfortunately, federal agencies often face limited staffing, resources and funding to address management of cultural resources. In addition to proposing a method for identifying buried landscapes, this project also provides a case study of partnerships between federal agencies and public universities; a mutually beneficial collaboration which provides agencies with data essential to land management while simultaneously providing students valuable opportunities to conduct cultural resource management assessments.",3165,Symposium,Presenter,3165,Zaakiyah,Cua

Volunteers and avocational archaeologists from the summer field school known as the State Conservation And Rescue Archaeology Program (SCRAP) have excavated several of the known Paleoindian sites in northern New Hampshire. Accessibility to the data recovered by SCRAP is an important aspect of this program, allowing many scholars to complete theses and dissertations using existing collections. This paper outlines how participation in the SCRAP field school has been beneficial to the author’s academic career, including her current Master’s thesis. The purpose of this thesis is to produce a spatial and statistical analysis of the artifact assemblage from excavation block K at the Potter Site (27-CO-60) located in Randolph, New Hampshire in comparison with the Jefferson VI (27-CO-74) salvage block in Jefferson, New Hampshire. This comparison not only examines the spatial relationships within one Paleoindian site (27-CO-60), but also helps the author make inferences about the similarities and differences between two Paleoindian sites in close proximity. Public archaeology programs such as SCRAP are a valuable part of North American Archaeology, without such programs this and other scholarly works would not be possible.

Both regions—Yellowstone and the Pinelands—have enough previous archaeological data to propose a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) predictive model of prehistoric site locations. While construction of the models varied for a variety of reasons, I used generally similar modelling methodologies for both. However, these two models were developed from very dissimilar site locational data and from completely different regional landscapes. On one hand, the Yellowstone model was developed specifically for Paleoindian archaeological site locations over a large and diverse mixture of landscapes in the Great Plains and Rockies.

Archaeological interpretations historically come from those in roles of academic authority, but we increasingly see acknowledgement of collaboration and contribution from community members not in those roles. A rise in diversity of cultural and heritage backgrounds among archaeologists is a factor in decentering approaches as they have been traditionally practiced. Encouraging this diversity should begin with archaeology education and exposure before college years. Linking Southwest Heritage through Archaeology is a program that aims to expose high schools students, who are from historically underserved and underrepresented groups in archaeology, to sites and opportunities that may spark interest in their continuing education and activism in archaeology. With a partnership between the National Park Service, University of Arizona, and nonprofit Environmental Education Exchange we have been providing opportunities for students to learn about archaeology while they contribute ideas that are shaped by their cultural and heritage backgrounds.

To achieve a continues lateral understanding of the underlying sediments, a seismic survey was conducted. The survey area covered the immediate flooded area of Vista Alegre, focusing on zones that have morphologically changed throughout time,  flooded during sea level rise, and which showed promise as likely locations for use during maritime activity by the past inhabitants.  The seismic survey results provided evidence for sea-level rise, and revealed a ridge-basin structure that was congruous with natural trends observed terrestrially. This uniqueness could be attributed to significant differences in the submerged landscape, and possibly the presence of anthropologically-altered offshore features.  The seismic interpreted data is useful both for a site scale spatial understanding of the flooded landscape history, as for aiming for potential location of marine archaeological excavations.

Located in the Laguna Yalahau of northern Quintana Roo, Mexico, the site is built on a small and low elevation island surrounded by mangrove. Inland from the site are freshwater wetlands (sabanas), while the near-shore waters of the restricted circulation lagoon are hypersaline. A significant research question is how the inhabitants of Vista Alegre accessed potable fresh water. We investigate this question by exploring the existence of freshwater offshore sinkholes, locally called Ojos de Agua in the surrounding area of Vista Alegre. Through the benchmarking of an aerial UAV based thermal image analysis and calibration at known ojos, we were able to successfully derive salinity variations due to point freshwater discharges in that area of the lagoon. We explain the methodology used to address correct radiometric measurements, thermal image stitching and identification of fresh-water discharge points. While it is still unclear whether such ojos were used for fresh water sources for the ancient Maya, understanding their geology and distribution provides indispensable information for the hydro-geological evolution of the area, and related coastal sites.

However, the vital source of potable water that would have supported this coastal settlement remains unknown. We present a hydrogeological assessment of the region to understand changing water sources over the last 2 millennia. Potential groundwater foci at the intersections of conjugate fracture sets are presently either mantled in sediments, and/or flooded by saline-hypersaline waters. Nearby surface drainage from rain-fed savannas also has seasonally variable salinity commonly exceeding potable limits. A number of shallow springs discharge a range of reduced salinity and cooler waters. These are locally called Ojos de Aguas, a form of flooded sinkhole. Casting the coastal landscape under the marginally lower sea levels of the late Holocene (-2m), some of the known ojos would have been terrestrial sinkholes/cenotes above sea level. Recent evidence indicates a downward tectonic movement of the Yucatan north coast, which would further leave the ojos unaffected by direct mixing with marine waters.

",Other,Paleoethnobotany,Subsistence and Foodways,"Ongoing investigations by the Nexus 1492 Synergy Project (Leiden University) at El Flaco archaeological site, has revealed the existence of an interesting Amerindian hamlet chronologically situated between XII and XV centuries. People who lived and died there, being carriers of the Meillacoid and Chicoid traditions, kept their kitchen areas extremely close to their houses, leaving noticeable remnants of their processing tools (shell scrapers, rudimentary grinding stones), cooking pots and griddles (made from stone and clay), serving implements (plates, bowls and ceramic bottles) and a key ""crushing"" tool used during food intake: human teeth. Residue samples from these plant-handling tools, recovered in one of the identified kitchens, has been subjected to ancient starch grain analysis aiming at knowing which were the main starchy plants prepared at these kitchens. Phytolith analysis was also done in soil samples from these areas to retrieve potentially important microbotanical remains from plants that are typically unnoticeable to other research techniques. This preliminary report present results from both analyses by discussing first some methodological issues on starch and phytolith studies in such contexts and offering later the first interpretations of the phytocultural dynamics attached to these spaces of identity expression.",3169,Symposium,Presenter,3169,Jaime R.,Pagan-Jimenez

",Arctic,Paleoethnobotany,Subsistence and Foodways,"The use of cultigens and wild plants by pre-historic populations has been well established for many regions of the circum-Caribbean and Greater Antilles. However, in the case of Cuba, the largest island in the Caribbean, the evidence is scarce. In this paper, we examine the population of Playa El Mango (Cauto Region, Eastern Cuba), traditionally understood by Cuban archaeologists as “fisher-gatherers”, to examine subsistence practices using a combination of starch evidence from dental calculus, aided by carbon and nitrogen isotopic-based probability analyses (Stable Isotope Analysis in R; SIAR). This dual analysis suggests that C3 (beans, root cultigens) and C4 plants (maize) were part of their diet since at least cal. 2110-2081 BP, along with wild plant species and various readily available estuarine, marine and terrestrial animal resources. This evidence demonstrated the use and management of cultigens for indigenous populations from Eastern Cuba since “Archaic” times.",3169,Symposium,Presenter,3169,Yadira,Chinique De Armas

",Other,Paleoethnobotany,Subsistence and Foodways,"Paleoethnobotanical information on the interrelationships between ancient human societies and plants in the Caribbean have been increasingly available in the last three decades because of the widespread application of novel methods for identification of macro and microbotanical remains. Consequently, the systematic identification of microremains such as starch grains, pollen, and phytoliths, along with the use of stable isotopes and other archaeometric techniques, has promoted renewed and more realistic visions on the use of plants by ancient Caribbean populations, and on the processes of domestication and dispersals of food crops in the area. During this symposium, lecturers will explore the results obtained from new methodologies regarding the identification and interpretation of different ancient plant signatures in the archaeological record. New plant-related (archaeometric) data and fresh archaeobotanical interpretations from different historic periods of the region will be exposed and discussed aiming to build needed and well-grounded interpretive tools to better appreciate cross-cultural and geographical variation of plant use, which have begun recently to be recognized from active researches in the area. The expected exchange of information and wide-ranging experiences of the researchers will provide an excellent opportunity to enrich our understanding on the long-term interrelationship between people and plants in the Caribbean.",3169,Symposium,Chair (Primary),3169,Yadira,Chinique De Armas

During that time, our team has used various techniques to accurately map late prehistoric Ecuadorian sites and to search for buried features. In the last two years we have used drone aerial photography, ground penetrating radar, and magnetometry to aid in investigations at the monumental site of Cochasquí. Photogrammetric processing of aerial photos has allowed us to create precise topographic maps, three-dimensional models of architectural features, and to calculate volumes of constructed features and adjacent quarry areas.

Ecuador is one of the most volcanically active countries on earth, and it’s impossible to examine the archaeology without considering both the direct and indirect impacts of volcanic eruptions. Through millennia, the imposing presence of the volcanos on the northern Ecuadorian landscape inspired fear and veneration, with the ever-present threat of disaster the price of life-giving sources of water. With a paucity of other hard stone, volcanic materials found in the region, ranging from fine powdery ignimbritic ash from Quilotoa volcano to dense cangahua, a consolidated volcanic ash, have been utilized for a variety of purposes in pre-Columbian cultures all over northern highland Ecuador. This paper examines some of the functional and ritual uses of volcanic materials at pre-Columbian sites from different periods across the northern highlands in order to better understand how ancient people conceptualized these destructive but life-giving forces of nature.",3170,Symposium,Presenter,3170,William,Pratt

The Manteño were one of many pre-Hispanic cultures exchanging local resources, engineering new technologies, and mass-producing goods along the coast of Ecuador.  Successful in their chiefdom and independent from the expanding Inca Empire, the Manteño remained culturally uninterrupted for more than 800 years.  The focus of this research is to understand the interruption and thus abandonment of the cloud forest.  In order to understand abandonment processes in the Las Tusas valley, this research uses behavioral and contextual lines of evidence.  Areas of activity are established by comparing soil chemical indicators (phosphate and pH), with ceramic analysis, and overall artifact distribution.  Pre-abandonment behavior will then be examined within the social, political, and environmental context of the last occupation at site C4-044.  The sum of this information will be further assessed in accordance with ethnohistorical perspectives from individuals whom participated in the abandonment of a modern day village in the cloud forest.

The region is home to 40 known Manteño sites with more than 100 stone structures across the river valleys of La Encantada, Las Tusas and La Mocora that carve the foothills of the Bola de Oro mountain. The Florida Atlantic University Archaeological Fieldschool in Ecuador, directed by Valentina Martinez, recorded 23 of these sites and 94 stone structures in the summers of 2015, 2016 and 2017. The analytical portion of this study utilizes the dimensions and features along with the location and orientation of each structure to create categories that will serve to better understand how the Manteño utilized their space.  Geostatistical tools in GIS helped create categorical maps for interpretation. Our results suggest that the Manteño maximized their ability to utilize the limited available flat space and densely occupied the area. These Manteño settlements in the foothills of Bola de Oro are not small peripheral occupations but mirror the large dense populated foothills of other Manteño centers such as Jaboncillo y Hojas in central Manabí.",3170,Symposium,Presenter,3170,Andres,Garzon-Oechsle

These narratives suggest that prior to this “revolution,” communities lived in harmony with their environment and any impact was local and trivial. Archaeology has recognised the recurrent issues that diverse human communities have faced in managing energy and how this translates into food production, material acquisition, and social coherence, but, has failed to demonstrate the value of this research to wider Global Change and Sustainability Research Communities. Energy and sustainability are enduring problems for humanity and analyses of current conditions would benefit from a long term historical analysis addressing the relationships among innovation, materiality, subsistence and ideology. Although archaeology has produced extensive data sets relating to long-term human-environmental relations, it is not strongly featured within the Sustainability and Energy Research Community.

Cultural heritage potentiates to build community identity and, at a time of increasing cultural diversity in European societies and nationalistic conflicts everywhere, it is prone to be involved in political constructions of the past into the present. Actually, when the European project itself becomes criticized and European common project is weakened, the capacity of cultural heritage to foster issues about common interests and values, calls to bolster a reflexive understanding of heritage, to which related disciplines as mainly Archaeology could contribute. The role of international professional associations and NGOs active in the field of cultural heritage is to ensure impartial and yet politically informed interpretation of cultural heritage, facilitating its preservation by making it of public concern.
