in this paper, i discuss the value of recreating ancient beers for archaeological research. increasingly, reconstructions of ancient alcoholic beverages have appeared in the popular news cycle. these recreations are typically one-offs and rely on limited archaeological evidence, for example residue analysis from a single vessel. such attempts, however, miss the opportunity to explore the greater variety of beers that were consumed in the past (with different adjuncts, wild yeasts, grain combinations, preparation techniques, etc.) and the place of these drinks within their broader gastronomic and dietary context. 

during the past two years, i have pursued an integrative program of reconstructing beers from the greco-roman periphery (ca. 600 bce-500 ce). by combining the surprisingly vast collection of greek and latin references to ancient beers, the archaeobotanical remains from individual settlements and cultures, broader archaeological and artistic evidence, and complementary food and wine preparations, i have produced several complete beers, individual components of beer (e.g. malts), adjunct-beer combinations, and brewing techniques. with this experimental archaeology, i demonstrate the diversity of research questions that can be addressed, especially those related to the dissemination of technological knowledge, ancient diet, agriculture, and feasting.
