the burren is a region located in southwest ireland containing the highest concentration of wedge tombs in the county showing a significance of place in the chalcolithic–early bronze age. contemporary to wedge tombs are large complex systems of settlement enclosures, farm fields, and other ritual monuments, which can be seen at sites across the burren, such as roughan hill, coolnatullagh, and carran plateau. excavations at these sites have provided cohesive radiocarbon dates within the chalcolithic–early bronze age. the context and patterns seen within this time period have yet to be explored at other locations across the burren where wedge tombs are present. in 2016 a survey was conducted by the author as a part of a m.a. in landscape archaeology at the national university of ireland, galway with the central aim to identify chalcolithic-early bronze age farming, settlement, and ritual patterns in the burren townland of termon. a secondary aim sought out to compare patterns seen at termon to roughan hill, coolnatullagh, and carran plateau in effort to shed further light into the chalcolithic - early bronze age burren. cross-site analysis revealed several similarities between features with differences expressing complexities within the chalcolithic–early bronze age.
