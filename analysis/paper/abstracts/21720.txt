this study will look at the miniature pottery vessels of hawikuh, a zuni pueblo. the hawikuh ceramic assemblage is one of the largest and most extensive of the prehistoric and early historic (1350-1600 a.d.) period in the southwest.  the site contains many miniature vessels but little or nothing is known about them.  i will begin this study by typing them and placing them in chronological and depositional contexts. this study may show the origins of people who settled in the zuni region. this study may suggest that salado peoples from the south immigrated to the zuni region in the middle part of the 14th century. i will assess the evidence for such movements of peoples by using these miniature vessels which are also typically used in ceremonial contexts like the ritual killing of funerary vessels and their association with kivas
