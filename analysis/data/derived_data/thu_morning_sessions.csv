Although the permafrost helps to maintain these features in excellent condition, the giant puzzle resulting from the collapse of the frame makes it hard to understand their original architecture. During the ArcticCHAR project, we excavated a house at Kuukpak (Northwest Territories, Canada) in 2014 and 2016. Facing the complexity of this feature, we created a new strategy to help us interpret this tangle of wooden remains. Combining both computer techniques (i.e. G.I.S, photogrammetry) with traditional field recording methods required a robust database to connect all of these data.
In this paper, we explain the design of the database and the technical choices we faced during its creation and implementation, with one of our main goals being to use open-source software. Without a doubt, this methodology will help us to understand the building techniques of these impressive Western Arctic houses.

In the archaeological record, evidence of bone grease extraction is interpreted from fractured faunal remains recovered from midden deposits and thermal features. However, most archaeological studies of bone grease extraction tend to focus on subsistence to the exclusion of other uses. This preoccupation with subsistence has often led to formulations of indigenous lifeways as pure response to environmental conditions. Most notably, the idea that prehistoric bone grease processing was a response to resource stress is a topic of vigorous discussion. 
Archaeological studies of bone grease processing have mostly overlooked its other uses. For instance, bone grease was commonly mixed with ocher, charcoal, and other minerals to make grease paint for decorative, ritual and medicinal uses. Our review of ethnohistoric literature coupled with archaeological data from sites in Texas shows a strong correlation between pigment minerals and bone grease processing. This has important implications for how bone grease processing locales are understood, indicating that the rendering of grease had a function in social life that went well beyond subsistence.

Holly Bend, a prolific and successful early 19th century plantation owned by Robert Davidson in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina has seen multiple excavations and research over the past several years. In particular, a collection of ceramic tobacco pipe fragments that have been excavated are analyzed to better understand the local smoking culture. Several methods are used, including X-ray fluorescence spectrometer analysis to determine local sourcing of the ceramic elements, residue analysis providing plant and material content of the pipe fragments, and a pipe typology identification. Residue analysis yields late 18th and early 19th century plant and material species associated with smoking and planation life. Pipe typology identification provides the stylistic and economic elements attributed to smoking cultures.

A.D. 1300, the three hundred year continuous occupation of Fox Farm, located in northern Kentucky, spans the Fort Ancient transformation (A.D. 1375-1425).  As the site grew in size during the fourteenth century, the settlement shifted from a circular to clustered arrangement of structures, to accommodate a larger population. This was accompanied by the development of a distinctive ceramic decorative tradition (deeply incised lines and punctations), coarsely serrated triangular points, chipped limestone discs, and decorated sandstone discoidals. By the late fourteenth century house size had increased, shifting from single- to multi-family dwellings. Fox Farm’s growth and its establishment as a central place within the Fort Ancient region represents a local response to the volatile cultural landscape of the late fourteenth/early fifteenth century.

     This paper focuses on the monumental flat-topped platform that forms the northern boundary of the ceremonial center of Early Xunantunich.

These activities share linkages to nearby sites in the valley, and are likely indicative of larger regional sociopolitical processes. Furthermore, our increasing understanding of the structure’s form and construction history shows that this platform required a massive investment of labor and materials, modifying the natural landscape in a truly monumental way.

Here, I use the Harvard Khipu Database, Python statistical libraries, and Benford’s Law to evaluate this claim and potentially identify a non-numerical Inka khipu sign unit. Specifically, I compare knot value frequencies in extant Inka khipus to those expected in a numerical dataset, as predicted by Benford’s Law. Benford’s Law is used to identify fraud in a variety of disciplines--providing numerical frequencies that are characteristic of a set of empirically observed numerical values as a point of comparison. Thus, if knot value frequencies diverge severely from Benford’s Law expectations for any set of khipus, these khipu knots likely functioned as non-numerical signs.",22,"Symposium",NA,"Jon_Clindaniel",2.75,10,2.75,"Th-morning",26

","Neolithic","Ceramic Analysis","Ritual and Symbolism","A newly identified figurine type in the South East European first farmers’ cultural world is discussed. Differing from all Early Neolithic “idols”, this figurine is monumental in size, but also significant in various other aspects. Almost each of its features opens new perspectives in interpreting early cult objects, including their gender issues.   
The horned clay figurine emerging from a podium, a table-like or a low roundish stand appears to have replaced the rather well known “goddess figurines” of South East Europe. These figurines depict the female upper body emerging from a lower part that is often called “house models” or “altars”. In our case, the emerging body is not human, but apparently that of cattle. 
   Generally, all horned bovid representations are regarded as bull figurines, representing the male procreative power. The one presented here has a realistic relief of a female genital organ, must be a depiction of a cow. I shall focus on this apparent bias in archaeological literature, which unfolds data about the early cattle husbandry and milking, explaining the appearance of cow representations in early farming communities.

These early studies tended towards overly simplistic arguments that often either overtly or inadvertently supported social Darwinism. Recent applications of ethnoarchaeology have also been accused of falling into similar pitfalls. While the critics are right to highlight the limitations of this approach, scholars can avoid making dangerous assumptions by working alongside the societies they wish to study. Working with modern communities to interpret the past is a valuable technique that can reveal different ways of doing that may not have originally occurred to the investigator. This paper shows how the assistance and guidance of carpenters living and working in Cairo’s City of the Dead has enabled a more nuanced and realistic view of ancient woodworking practices. These modern artists have inspired hypotheses that, when tested against the material evidence, have led to a new understanding of technological processes and the position of craftspeople in ancient Egyptian society.

Data is taken from six comparable carpets, informing on two aspects of carpet variation. The dimensions and knot densities of the carpets’ motifs are used to examine the variation introduced to the carpets through technological limitations of an upright loom. The carpets are found to be well standardized, with overall dimension and density error rates within range of the published limits of human replication ability (approx. 3%). However, underlying trends in the distribution of this variation informs on the abilities and tendencies of the knotters to correct for limitations of the loom technology.

Along the Pacific Coast, the appearance of shell fishhooks has been interpreted as part of different contexts of growing population, economic specialization, and social complexity, among others. Along the coast of the Atacama Desert (18° to 26° Lat. South), fishhooks on Choromytilus chorus shells (mussel) appear in archaeological sites located along 1.6 thousand kilometers of coast with dates around 7500 years BP. Around 4500 BP. shell fishhooks disappeared from the Chilean archaeological record and were replaced by hooks made of cactus spines and animal bones. During the ~3000 years that hooks on mussel shells were present, archaeological deposits show evidence of increasing social complexity, specialized maritime economy and semi-sedentary settlement systems. Changes in hook´s shapes are also identified. Observed changes in fishing technology suggest deep changes within ancient fishing communities of South America, which were probably linked by long distance movements of people along thousands of kilometers.
