in the past two decades, advancing methodologies and the recovery of new cultural materials have expanded our knowledge of the earliest peopling of the ozarks, ouachita mountains and mississippi valley of arkansas. in the late 1990’s, gis analyses in the mississippi valley of northeastern arkansas highlighted the significant association of early cultures to the lithic resources of the landscape and subsequent collaboration with pidba in the past decade has put this state-level record in continental context. ongoing documentation of fluted-points and their geographic distributions continues to shed new light on these earliest cultures of the interior southeast.
