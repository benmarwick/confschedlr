While go-to forms of archaeology outreach, such as lectures, are still valuable, the number of places, real and digital, open to talk about archaeological information has increased the ways that we can interact with the public. This can involve expanding the presence of archaeologists on things like social media, through Twitter and Instagram. As well as embracing the myriad ways that people get information through blogs, podcasts, twitch, video games, and by attending non-academic gatherings. All of these avenues allow the public to interact directly with archaeologists quickly and regularly, keeping them abreast of new discoveries and inform them of what archaeology is really like.  However, a common critique of technology based outreach is that it tends to be an archaeological echo chamber, with archaeologists following one another rather than getting non-archaeologists, and non-scientists involved. This forum is interested in discussing those outreach possibilities that go beyond the lecture and museum event to better fulfill our duties to the public and discuss the efficacy of these methods at building audiences.","3152","Forum","Moderator (Primary)","Paulina_Przystupa",3152,0,7,"7","1.75",NA,"Forum",1.75,"Sa-morning"

This location was continually re-occupied for the last 3,000 years, by Late Archaic to historic-era Native American (probably Ho-Chunk) communities. Bioturbation, military activities, and other cultural and natural processes easily disturb the sandy soils at Stillwell Crossing, resulting in substantial mixing of the archaeological components, so the Phase III research design tested two questions: 1) How effective is subsurface geophysical prospecting in such contexts? and 2) How do spatial distributions of artifacts reflect both depositional and post-depositional processes at the site? Investigations demonstrated that the effectiveness of geophysical prospecting is limited, especially for identifying ephemeral pre-contact features. Vertical distribution of artifacts showed no distinctly stratified deposits, though horizontal distributions of lithic raw material varied across the three sites. Mineralogical analysis of soil samples, radiocarbon dates, and compositional analysis of a glass trade bead all yielded informative results about the extent and nature of past human activities at Stillwell Crossing. These mitigation efforts, which also included construction of a mock cultural site, enhance the military training facility at Fort McCoy.","3115","Symposium","Presenter","Heather_Walder",3115,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Sa-morning"

Site testing indicated a well-stratified and reasonably preserved multicomponent site situated in unconsolidated eolian sand and silt deposits atop an ancient alluvial landform. Three cultural components have been identified so far, dating to the early Allerød, Younger Dryas, and Middle Holocene intervals, respectively. Thousands of archaeological materials, including lithic debris and faunal and floral remains, associated with domestic features such as hearths and possible dwellings abound in the lower two components. 

In June and July of 2017 we began large-scale block excavation of the site in an area where we found living floor debris during the testing phase of the project. We excavated 21 m2 through the Younger Dryas-aged living floor.

We review the CEMML surveys and site exams along Wind Creek - a tributary of Wildcat Creek - that have produced an unexpected density of upland prehistoric sites. 

In this context, we discuss the prehistoric sites types found along Wind Creek and explore how they are part of settlement patterns within the larger Wildcat Creek watershed. We also examine differences in the artifact assemblages from 40 sites along Wind Creek, including the presence/number of hafted bifaces, scrapers, expedient tools and various types of debitage. Notably, the diagnostic hafted bifaces found along Wind Creek indicate that the area was used, at least sporadically, during the Archaic, Woodland and Late Prehistoric periods. A number of scrapers found at sites along Wind Creek conversely indicates the importance of hide-processing or perhaps wood-working in the area. We suggest that the Wind Creek locality contained important resources, perhaps available seasonally, that were exploited by prehistoric groups with habitations and base camps along Wildcat Creek.

Naturally, this is not popular with those providing funding to keep training lands open and sustainable.  The Fort Drum Cultural Resources Program has developed unique methods for protecting sites while allowing them to be used as training assets.  In collaboration with Civil Affairs Operations, they have provided site data in the form of no-strike lists to military trainers, allowing sites to be put into play during several large-scale training events.  Program staff also served as role-players, representing host nation officials and indigenous peoples in a training scenario.  Not only did this approach enrich the training opportunity, designation of off limits areas as sacred properties where incursion would result in violent retribution or command consequences resulted in the best site protection and avoidance in the history of these exercises.  As a bonus for the program, it also served the purpose of keeping cultural resources and heritage relevant in an ever-changing political and social environment.","3115","Symposium","Presenter","Margaret_Schulz",3115,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Sa-morning"

Land-use models based on the results of systematic shovel testing across 162 square miles at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, indicate continuous occupation throughout prehistory, small group size and short terms of residential tenure. Although the archaeological site is the unit of resource management, most sites comprise multiple components, and comparing component spatial density across presettlement vegetation communities and wildfire-frequency zones provides a means for exploring prehistoric land use. Archaic components are more dense in Xeric Longleaf Pine–Wiregrass Sandhills communities where upland flats offer long sight lines and minimal topographic relief; ideal for overland travel, logistical procurement, large game hunting and family-band migration. The spatial density of Woodland components is higher in Mesic Longleaf Pine–Wiregrass Slope, Small Stream Swamp and Depression Pond communities where less frequent, lower intensity wildfire encourages deciduous mast-bearing trees and richer soil for horticulture. Quantifying cultural component spatial density across vegetative community type also provides a standard for evaluating the research potential of resources, determining NRHP eligibility, and ranking potentially eligible resources for further testing.","3115","Symposium","Presenter","Joseph_Herbert",3115,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Sa-morning"

This region, however, possesses a particularly complex isotopic ecology, including both a large number of isotopically variable food sources and a high degree of isotopic overlap between different food groups. As such, to date, most regional paleodietary studies have been limited to descriptive and qualitative conclusions concerning the relative contributions of different food sources. In this study we apply an iterative Bayesian multi-source mixing model (FRUITS) to human stable isotope data from the prehistoric population of Tutu, St. Thomas, USVI, to generate quantitative and probabilistic individual paleodietary reconstructions. The isotope dataset includes both bone collagen (d13Cco and d15Nco) and apatite (d13Cap) data. The results of two different dietary models using four and five distinct food groupings, respectively, are compared and assessed relative to other relevant archaeological evidence concerning past diet at the site. We highlight the potentials and limitations of multi-source mixing models for regional paleodietary studies, and their relevance to ongoing debates within Caribbean archaeology concerning the relative importance of different food sources such as manioc, maize, and seafood.","3169","Symposium","Presenter","Jason_Laffoon",3169,1,8,"9","2.25",NA,"Symposium",2.25,"Fr-afternoon"

Results from a sediment core campaign resolved the character, environmental associations, and ages of underlying sediments. To achieve a continues lateral understanding of the underlying sediments, a seismic survey was conducted. The survey area covered the immediate flooded area of Vista Alegre, focusing on zones that have morphologically changed throughout time,  flooded during sea level rise, and which showed promise as likely locations for use during maritime activity by the past inhabitants.  The seismic survey results provided evidence for sea-level rise, and revealed a ridge-basin structure that was congruous with natural trends observed terrestrially. This uniqueness could be attributed to significant differences in the submerged landscape, and possibly the presence of anthropologically-altered offshore features.  The seismic interpreted data is useful both for a site scale spatial understanding of the flooded landscape history, as for aiming for potential location of marine archaeological excavations.

Inland from the site are freshwater wetlands (sabanas), while the near-shore waters of the restricted circulation lagoon are hypersaline. A significant research question is how the inhabitants of Vista Alegre accessed potable fresh water. We investigate this question by exploring the existence of freshwater offshore sinkholes, locally called Ojos de Agua in the surrounding area of Vista Alegre. Through the benchmarking of an aerial UAV based thermal image analysis and calibration at known ojos, we were able to successfully derive salinity variations due to point freshwater discharges in that area of the lagoon. We explain the methodology used to address correct radiometric measurements, thermal image stitching and identification of fresh-water discharge points. While it is still unclear whether such ojos were used for fresh water sources for the ancient Maya, understanding their geology and distribution provides indispensable information for the hydro-geological evolution of the area, and related coastal sites.

However, the vital source of potable water that would have supported this coastal settlement remains unknown. We present a hydrogeological assessment of the region to understand changing water sources over the last 2 millennia. Potential groundwater foci at the intersections of conjugate fracture sets are presently either mantled in sediments, and/or flooded by saline-hypersaline waters. Nearby surface drainage from rain-fed savannas also has seasonally variable salinity commonly exceeding potable limits. A number of shallow springs discharge a range of reduced salinity and cooler waters. These are locally called Ojos de Aguas, a form of flooded sinkhole. Casting the coastal landscape under the marginally lower sea levels of the late Holocene (-2m), some of the known ojos would have been terrestrial sinkholes/cenotes above sea level. Recent evidence indicates a downward tectonic movement of the Yucatan north coast, which would further leave the ojos unaffected by direct mixing with marine waters. Vista Alegre’s inhabitants may have benefited from cenote potable perennial water sources that are now clandestine due to the sea level and tectonic shifts.

However, recent investigations that focus more on human-environment interactions and domestic economies reveal a more dynamic and varied past in micro-regions of Eurasia. Pastoral strategies dating to the 3rd-2nd millennium BCE were regionally diverse, and societies were engaged in contacts that extended beyond the steppe world confines. These new discoveries bring material assemblages back into focus with the fresh purpose of scientifically examining the spectrum of technologies and social dynamics that generated the materiality of Eurasian pastoralism.

The chain of mountains that stretches across Central Asia constitutes a geographical obstacle that slowed down the dispersal process. Special strategies of adaptation to high altitude regions were requires not only by humans, but also by plants that came along due to changes in season length, climatic conditions, UV intensity and other. Therefore, the mountain regions acted as geographical filters that influenced what plant species and their varieties gets dispersed to further regions of Eurasia. The territory of Kyrgyzstan (almost 90% of the territory lies above 1900 masl) constitutes a key area for the study of crop and animal adaptation strategies, as the filtering effect on plant and animal selection by communities here would have been the most distinct.
The archaeobotanical material under discussion is coming from the high altitude sites in Kyrgyzstan. Some features of crop adaptation observed in the research add to a wider picture explaining the pattern of crop dispersal across Eurasia.

Here we closely examine the dietary importance of grains and meat at several sites in western China from this period. We compare previous bulk collagen stable isotope results with compound specific carbon isotope analyses of individual amino acids extracted from human and animal bone collagen. Because essential and non-essential amino acids reflect different components of diet, compound specific carbon isotope analysis offers a means to isotopically distinguish between protein and non-protein dietary components, making it possible to determine to what degree humans were consuming meat directly versus consuming animals that were fed millet. Preliminary results for humans from Huoshaogou corroborate previous Bayesian mixing model estimates by suggesting that humans were consuming millet directly.","3164","Symposium","Presenter","Rachel_Reid",3164,0,15,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Fr-afternoon"

First, what are the discourses and rhetorics of heritage—how is heritage invoked and talked about, like a sign of history, in making statements about the world? How has that shifted over time, as the term is increasingly invoked to explain and defend a wide range of actions and attitudes, and how do the different discursive communities who speak about heritage engage (or not) with one another? Most importantly, why have these discursive transformations not been accompanied by similar transformations in policy? The answer to that last question requires us to consider a second mode of heritage, namely, what does heritage do, as a sign in history, when it is invoked, encountered, and circulated? What does heritage activate, and what are its “practical effects”? Drawing on several examples including the recent removal of confederate monuments in the US, I argue that while operating in these two modes—as signs of and in history—heritage’s greatest potential for transformational change is when it ceases acting as a rhetorical device and instead becomes itself the center of experiential social action, such as through its encounter, circulation, or being made visible (or invisible).","3160","Symposium","Presenter","Alexander_Bauer",3160,0,10,"10","2.5",NA,"Symposium",2.5,"Fr-afternoon"

Together, they discerned the culture’s fundamental diagnostics: pottery, architecture, stone sculpture and ritual practices associated with ancestor-fertility cult. Both employed these elements to epitomise archaeological styles and compartmentalise cultural regions, at the same time that they were positioned as units in broad comparative thinking (e.g., religion, complexity, diffusion, cosmology). The paper contends that their Recuay findings emerged largely out of collections work, ethnohistory and close analysis of objects and ‘artworks’.  Notably, field archaeology had little to do with their intellectual legacy on Recuay; rather it was won through ambitious visual arguments and analogies, and expressed most saliently by their use of illustrations in a ‘visual archaeology.’","3154","Symposium","Presenter","George_Lau",3154,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Fr-afternoon"

buildings were part of contemporary indigenous roads, religion and labor; and how this
incorporation defined scientific understandings of indigeneity in this Andean region. In this

Katrina J. Bettcher & Lidio M. Valdez 
In 1954, newlywed archaeologists Francis Allen “Fritz” Riddell and Dorothy Menzel arrived in the Acari Valley on the south coast of Peru with the purpose of investigating the site of Tambo Viejo as part of the Inca Royal Highway Project directed by Victor von Hagen. Various sites in the region were recorded and investigated. After retirement in the early 1980s, Fritz was drawn back to Peruvian archaeology. With the California Institute of Peruvian Studies, projects involving Peruvian and foreign archaeologists, as well as non-professional participants from Acari and abroad, revisited sites and investigated new findings.  Fritz was concerned about the destruction of sites that had been recorded in the 1950s so he worked with local officials and citizens to encourage preservation. Rescue excavations were carried out at Tambo Viejo. Materials from looted sites were recovered, catalogued and stored. Though he passed away in 2002, Francis A. Riddell’s legacy endures in the Acari museum that has been named after him and in continuing work at the site of Tambo Viejo.

I began by quantifying problems (Survey on Field Safety: Middle East, North Africa, and The Mediterranean Basin: 2014, 2015), looking at gender-based violence and discrimination in field assignments and in post-field research and publication. 
My goals are to: determine factors contributing to safe/unsafe fieldwork environments; determine best practices and effective ways to implement them; develop standards, policies, protocols and trainings to educate excavators about relevant ethics and laws for field and research projects; and, under ASOR’s auspices, provide all excavators with much-needed information.  At The University of Arizona, I work with the offices of Title IX, Global Initiatives (Study Abroad), and the Dean of Students, and I am involved with the new Center for the Study and Prevention of Gender-Based Violence.

Private consulting firms contract with federal agencies to assist in compliance with federal laws such as NHPA, NAGPRA, ARPA and AHPA, and additional state laws. As contract archaeologists, we often work extended periods within small groups in isolated areas, which lends to work environments away from support systems of family and friends. Co-workers depend on each other for safety and support in more intimate environments than non-field work. This intimate nature of our work environment often permits lines between professional/formal relationships and personal relationships to blur. Consequently, individual behaviors, intentional or not, can result in uncomfortable and/or un-safe work environments. Field conditions can provide a context in which civil rights and Title IX can inadvertently be lost. In addition, the small, isolated nature of the group can act as a deterrent to speaking out against harassment or discrimination. I argue that CRM firms need to prioritize Title IX to the same degree as other federal laws that govern our work. To redefine the existing culture of our field, individuals at all levels must participate in the discussions and creation of a safe, healthy and respectful work environment.","3148","Symposium","Presenter","Trinity_Schlegel",3148,0,7,"7","1.75",NA,"Symposium",1.75,"Fr-afternoon"

While foreign-produced goods and emulation of foreign goods or architectural cannons can provide circumstantial evidence of inter-regional connectivity, isotopic analysis of human skeletons can offer concrete evidence that non-locals visited, resided in, or were buried in a community. This research synthesizes results of isotopic analysis of human skeletons from the cemetery of Uraca, in the Majes Valley, and describes the artifact assemblage recovered. The data presented will demonstrate that the individuals interred at the site were linked to material and ideological traditions of Nasca and other desert and coastal valleys through mortuary practices and violent trophy-head taking, while there is only limited evidence that they emulated Wari material culture or tapped into Middle Horizon trade networks.

Lyon (1966) argues that the beginning of the LIP was marked by a revival of Middle Horizon iconography, suggesting particular cultural or political value of this period to the people of Ica. Moreover, the remote oracle/pilgrimage center of Pachacamac on the central coast appears to have exerted particularly powerful influence on Ica during the Middle Horizon, but also thereafter on the developing regional culture in Ica. This poorly understood relationship with the central coast may have had a pivotal role in the development and rise to power of the Ica people during the subsequent LIP period.","3143","Symposium","Presenter","Sara_Morrisset",3143,0,15,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Fr-afternoon"

However, the relationship was not a simple, unilineal one with Wari the dominant core society and Nasca the passive peripheral society. Instead a bilateral relationship developed in which many things were shared between the two. Wari colonies and foreigners are found in Nasca, along with changes in local settlements, new mortuary practices, and new long-distance prestige goods. Many aspects of Nasca culture were incorporated by Wari including ceramic technology, iconography, flexed burial positions, and trophy head taking. The evidence from Nasca suggests a hybrid culture developed that is most evident in the Loro ceramic style and in ritual practices involving trophy head taking. It is possible that it is from the Nasca region that Wari influence, and this new hybrid culture, spread to valleys further south along the coast.","3143","Symposium","Presenter","Christina_Conlee",3143,0,15,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Fr-afternoon"

Our field excavations in 2012 and 2015 revealed a long-standing tradition of mortuary treatment that persisted even after the arrival of the Wari in the area.  While many components of this tradition appear to have originated locally, other components closely parallel Nazca populations, including patterns of trauma, funerary ritual and the presence of “trophy heads”.   The collective nature of the burials suggests the inclusion of both sexes, and all age groups.  Interestingly, we have detected a form of secondary burial for neonates and infants.  Our data suggest that many of them were not buried at the time of death, but rather at a later time, positioned next to adult women.  In this context, we argue that the Ramada mortuary tradition in the Vitor Valley was part of a long-standing practice that remained remarkably unchanged despite co-habitation of the Valley with altiplano populations, and that promoted ongoing communication between the living and the dead. These collective burials may point to social and/or biological units that were perpetuated even after dead.

Quinoa, tubers, and molle were ubiquitous at the site, along with maize, with chicha made of maize/molle produced and consumed there. These remains suggest a ritual or communal diet heavy in C3 foods, although taphonomy and food processing will also be considered as mediating factors. In comparison, stable isotope analysis of individuals buried at the site compare favorably to the elite inhabitants of the Wari secondary city of Conchopata, who ate a diet dominated by C4 plants (maize) and meat (maize foddered camelids).

What responsibilities do we and the SAA have to our colleagues, students, mentors, and friends? In particular, how do our actions continue to marginalize people of color within our membership as well as minimalize the importance of racial justice actions? This paper examines how white privilege and calls for scientific “objectivity” ignore the structural violence that continues to impact our practice as well as our participation in current political and social activism.

This paper grapples with these questions archaeologically, ethnographically and historically by considering monuments and memory through extremely well-explored cases in Bavaria and through other far less discussed cases in the Northeastern U.S.  It considers the historical narratives that American public school students grow up learning in relation to monuments and material markers, and discusses potential pedagogical approaches for exploring histories of monuments that never were.  Drawing from Indigenous theories of settler colonialism, it seeks to probe possibilities for how future memory work might be envisioned as part of archaeological teaching and public engagement.","3116","Electronic Symposium","Presenter","Franco_Rossi",3116,0,8,"8","2",NA,"Electronic Symposium",2,"Fr-afternoon"

Despite these advances, however, it seems that many archaeologists continue to adhere to the letter of the law while disregarding its spirit, suggesting that the colonial imperatives that gave rise to our discipline remain firmly entrenched. The Eurocentric interpretive frameworks, use of loaded terminology, and paternalistic application of science in determining cultural affiliation show that as a discipline, we still have much learn from those whose pasts we attempt to understand. We ought to critically and reflexively evaluate our discipline’s very purpose. Instead of self-serving, academic ladder climbing and insensitive explication of scientific “truths,” the practice of archaeology has the power to strengthen indigenous rights to place and to critical resources. As Western scholars, we need to listen more and pontificate less if we truly wish to serve the needs of descendant communities. This is, after all, what NAGPRA and other federal laws ask of us. Regardless of law, however, our professional ethics should compel us to do better.

Advancing archaeology towards greater inclusivity is an increasingly common conversation within the discipline. The majority of literature on this topic focuses on grassroots efforts to include marginalized descendant communities or other stakeholders in research design, implementation, knowledge dissemination and curation. An ever present and often unanalyzed aspect of research (especially abroad), are the required negotiations with government officials, who are political stakeholders invested in maintaining the status quo. These negotiations can be source of friction among research goals, community commitments and governmental regulations. My research in the Toledo District, Belize, shows that dealing with political realities while staying committed to social justice and engagement is an uncomfortable but vital balance to be struck. I argue that archaeologists can work as advocates to keep open lines of communication with governments as well as local people; we hold a privileged though awkward position that can be carefully and strategically leveraged for social justice aims. Anthropological archaeology has much to offer if we use it as a tool for greater inclusivity and social justice, within our borders or abroad.

In this paper I present a case study, an ongoing negotiation between myself and a student in my introductory class who insists on a formal in-class debate between evolution and creationism. That many scientists do not find religious beliefs and evolution mutually exclusive so far falls on deaf ears. I refuse to place creationist concepts at the same level as evolutionary theory, particularly in a science class. I argue that the core of this conflict is as much about intellectual authority as it is evolution. Our mutual refusal to accept the other’s point of view is a microcosm of the contemporary political climate.

Ecuador is one of the most volcanically active countries on earth, and it’s impossible to examine the archaeology without considering both the direct and indirect impacts of volcanic eruptions. Through millennia, the imposing presence of the volcanos on the northern Ecuadorian landscape inspired fear and veneration, with the ever-present threat of disaster the price of life-giving sources of water. With a paucity of other hard stone, volcanic materials found in the region, ranging from fine powdery ignimbritic ash from Quilotoa volcano to dense cangahua, a consolidated volcanic ash, have been utilized for a variety of purposes in pre-Columbian cultures all over northern highland Ecuador. This paper examines some of the functional and ritual uses of volcanic materials at pre-Columbian sites from different periods across the northern highlands in order to better understand how ancient people conceptualized these destructive but life-giving forces of nature.","3170","Symposium","Presenter","William_Pratt",3170,0,9,"9","2.25",NA,"Symposium",2.25,"Fr-morning"

Bill Gardner’s research in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia in the 1980’s emphasized a focus on micro-cryptocrystalline lithic sources in the settlement system; smaller territories on the order of 40 to 150 km in diameter and a flexible social organization during the seasonal round involving a pattern of changing micro- and macro-bands. These issues continue to be important in the analysis of Paleoindian adaptive strategies and now include more controlled examinations of community patterning; microwear analysis; refitting studies; and lithic sourcing based on trace element analysis. New sites have been discovered resulting in the definition of site clusters and sites associated with paths. Improved chronological controls have enable researches to speculate on changing settlement systems within the Paleoindian period. These studies have resulted in the definition of at least two different Paleoindian adaptive strategies in the Middle Atlantic region.

Seventeenth century colonial chroniclers repeatedly mention a series of places and objects that surrounded political negotiations and efforts at alliance-building by Powhatan societies. While regional scholarship has focused on competition over subsistence resources, regional trade dynamics, and the regulated exchange of “prestige goods” as central to the development of these political structures, we shift the focus toward the engagement between these societies and specific places and objects whose enduring legacies spanned multiple generations. We argue that the development of the seventeenth century political geography was predicated on the maintenance of persistent ritualized spaces and the circulation of enduring objects whose shifting meanings connected the past and present, bolstered political structures, and facilitated the transfer of power from one generation to the next. Archaeological evidence indicates that shell and copper adornment objects entered the region during the thirteenth century, coinciding with the first appearance of palisade architecture, and the development of intentionally constructed ritual landscapes that served to create individual community identities, while at the same time drawing communities into a cross-regional political system.","3158","Symposium","Presenter","Christopher_Shephard",3158,1,10,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Fr-morning"

Two of the larger pit features exhibited excellent bone preservation and were densely filled with a mix of aquatic and terrestrial fauna including large amounts of oyster, clam, and fish remains. Many of these specimens can be identified using traditional methods (i.e., comparison with a reference collection). The results of flotation from these two features, however, yielded tens of thousands of small fish vertebrae not typically identifiable using morphological characteristics alone.

The aim of this presentation is to discuss what we currently know about the distribution of Acheulean hominins, and to report on new field work findings in southern Asia, particularly in the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian peninsula. We examine technological trends and present new information on the dating of archaeological sites. We examine the role that climate change plays in the demographic history of Acheulean hominins and whether there is temporal overlap of archaic species and advancing groups of Homo sapiens populations. We address long-standing questions about whether Acheulean tool-making hominins moved into Eastern Asia, and the implications of this information with respect to our evolutionary history.

been a difficult task. One suggestion has been our use of symbolic culture, the use and transmission of symbols intergenerationally. There is much discussion, however, about who the first ‘symbol users’ were, partly due to debates as to what actually makes something ‘symbolic.’ In this paper, I discus how anthropologists first came to use symbol as the sine qua non of modern human behavior. Then, using archaeological and fossil data from the Old World, I show that many of the behaviors that are often suggested to be the sole purview of Homo sapiens have their genesis in the more remote past. Drawing from semeiotic theory and the extended evolutionary synthesis, I argue that applying a more integrative theoretical framework can allow paleoanthropologists to discuss the behavior of our hominin ancestors without assuming too much or too little about their ‘humanness.’

In the specific context of the Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition, the notion of acculturation has usually been considered as a unidirectional, one-size-fits-all social mechanism to explain both the appearance of transitional industries and the disappearance of Neanderthals. However, considering the growing genetic evidence of sustained interbreeding between distinct hominin populations during the Pleistocene, it is likely that interpopulation interactions were more fluid and dynamic than often assumed under the acculturation scenario. To account for this, we present here a review of the notion of acculturation and the likely archaeological manifestations of its different forms. We then compare this against the archaeological record of Western Europe in order to demonstrate how a more nuanced and ethnographically-grounded approach to the notion of acculturation is needed in order to properly model and ultimately make sense of the full variety of human experiences in that critical moment of our evolutionary past.","3156","Symposium","Presenter","Julien_Riel-Salvatore",3156,1,10,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Fr-morning"

","Paleolithic","Lithic Analysis","Material Culture and Technology","The eastern African Early Pleistocene witnessed critical shifts in climate, environment, hominin anatomy and behavior. The lithic record shows change within this broader context. After 1.8 Ma, Large Cutting Tools (LCTs), such as bifaces, entered the hominin lithic repertoire. These artifacts are widely viewed as the first evidence of lithic shaping. Many archaeologists theorize both cognitive and practical differences between “flaking” and “shaping” among knapping strategies. Most of these cognitive models are based on our current understanding of living human cognition, not that of Early Pleistocene hominins. Little empirical evidence supports these concepts’ usefulness for Early Pleistocene archaeology and the study of hominin cognitive evolution. Further, we often lack holistic information about non-LCT components of Early Acheulean lithic assemblages. Early LCTs, and associated non-LCT lithics, occur in the Kokiselei Site Complex in West Turkana, Kenya (1.8 – 1.76 Ma). This project fills a gap in the empirical research necessary for testing hypotheses about “shaping” and LCT emergence through holistic technological analyses of both LCT and non-LCT lithics at Kokiselei and an experimental program that investigates the knapping strategies employed by hominins at Kokiselei. Here, non-LCT lithic components from Kokiselei are compared to data collected from an experimental lithic assemblage.","3156","Symposium","Presenter","Hilary_Duke",3156,1,10,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Fr-morning"

However, the growing body of data provided by provenance research raises the need to critically assess how this information practically translates into proxies of hominin behaviour. This question is particularly prescient when considering the efficacy of raw material studies in exploring the lives of archaic Homo, in this case Homo neanderthalensis. Middle Palaeolithic foraging behaviour has historically been seen as ‘non-curated’, lacking a depth of planning and adaptive response to dynamic environments (e.g. Binford 1979; 1982). However, recent advances in our understanding of Neanderthals, suggest a species capable of complex subsistence behaviour, such as transport and curation.

The impact of “Kormantse” as a cultural entity on the interpretations of the formation and transformations of the African Diaspora remains a major challenge among academics as many questions about the origins, migration episodes of populations, events and the process(es) involved remain unanswered. While bio-anthropologists explore DNA evidence, using various techniques of sequencing for possibly identifying common African ancestral connections or relationships, the need to review various routes and sources of the migrations, as well as the associated historical circumstances and places continue to be very critical. This presentation examines selected maps and other related documentation for speculating about the possible origins or combination of origins and routes that may have triggered off or played various roles in the processes of the creation of what we often consider today as “Kormantse in the African Diaspora.”  Maps of selected slave trade and migration routes are reviewed against the backdrop of selected recent speculations and interpretations of “Kormantse” in the history and culture of the African Diaspora.

","Historic","Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology","Communities of Practice","Incipient aspects of syncretic processes among Africans and Europeans had begun on the African continent from the fifteenth century, with a particular reference noted for religious practices. Considering the relatively isolated participation of the two groups within the early interactive sphere of West Africa, as well as the in-situ contexts of the African cultures, some syncretical expressions were evident, yet due to the disproportional ratio of populations, were more subtle on the continent. However, once the various African populations were forcibly transported to the Caribbean, eliminating a strong homogeneity of cultural traditions, the degree of interactive exchange between Africans and Europeans increased dramatically, resulting in more complex and open forms of syncretism. This presentation seeks to provide a discussion of how African-European syncretic processes manifested themselves in successful forms, such as with benign cognitive compromises relating to religious practices, as well as how these syncretic processes were also rejected, such as with conflictive cognitive aspects in forms of aesthetic expression. It is proposed here that variable degrees of syncretical effectiveness were based on the fundamental variation of African and European cognitive approaches, with two archaeological case studies presented, one of successful syncretism and another rejected syncretism on St. Maarten.

Although temporally distinct and archaeologically separated as two discontinuous communities within a shared landscape, excavations of both sites have suggested that the ceremonial structures of the later Moche occupation were strongly influenced by the presence of the architectural remains of the Formative period community. This paper will trace how specific spatial and ideological concepts stretched across time between these two communities and how their situation in the landscape mediated the construction of identity and personhood.","3153","Symposium","Presenter","Giles_Spence-Morrow",3153,1,14,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Fr-morning"

","Paleolithic","Lithic Analysis","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers","Searching for the origin points of major cultural revolutions and transitions has long been a driver of archaeological research, yet led to research focused on perceived boundaries, rather than continuity. Research into the origins of so-called modern human behavior, the origins of social complexity, the earliest domesticates, among others, all focus on defining moments of change that may be undetectable in the archaeological record. Perhaps some of the most enduring archaeological questions revolve around the ‘origins of agriculture’. In this paper, we explore changing historical conceptions of the ‘origins of agriculture’ in Southwest Asia in archaeological discourse and how, through the lens of the longue durée, we can trace aspects of material culture, human action, and complex human-landscape dynamics in deep time. Using examples from the Epipalaeolithic of eastern Jordan, we address current debates on Neolithization by exploring the implications of perspectives that focus on ‘becoming’ Neolithic and ‘being’ a hunter-gatherer. Through this perspective we discuss different scales of material culture analysis; from the ‘ethnographic’ lens identifying individual behaviors in the past, to the longue durée of material culture trends. This multi-scalar perspective gives new insight into how we construct cultural boundaries and understand change during the ‘origins of agriculture’.","3153","Symposium","Presenter","Lisa_Maher",3153,1,14,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Fr-morning"

A variety of new groups emerged during the Bronze Age in the Carpathian Basin —some had powerful rulers holding feasts and controlling the trade in commodities, and some were egalitarian peoples leaving little evidence for social differentiation outside of age and gender. This paper uses a comparative and multi-scalar perspective to study two different social trajectories in the Carpathian Basin during the second millennium BC: the Lower Körös Basin in Eastern Hungary, and the Danube and its tributaries in Central Hungary. We begin with coarse-grained chronological settlement data and consider the importance of foundational differences in population in both regions. We then look at the productive catchment and yearly agricultural needs of settlements, and weigh their likely importance in decision-making at the household level. Finally, we address how geographic location and compounding trade interests over successive generations potentially influenced the changing relationships between people and communities in the Körös and Central Danube regions in the second millenium BC.

A case study utilizing Hawaiian house sites exemplifies this approach. The case study presented here analyzes data from 16th century house complexes, a time when daily practices were developing in ways not reflected in the (later) ethnohistories. However, this paper illustrates that utilizing complimentary micro and macro artifact analytical methods allows for a reconstruction of daily practices by comparing the data with the ethnohistorically-derived predictive models.

Archaeological discourse has largely shifted away from addressing long-term change and continuity, instead exploring human society in narrower slices of “ethnographic” time, with only superficial reference to larger time scales. This is partly a reaction to earlier examinations of large-scale or long-term change, which frequently produced deterministic explanations that reduced or ignored human agency, or was unable to explain how different time scales articulated with each other. 

Yet this “ethnographic” approach has its own problems, and risks reconstructing archaeological “subjects” in ways that reinforce the divide between mind and matter, interiority and exteriority, or subject and object. How can archaeologists reinstate the “deep-time” perspective as one of archaeology’s greatest contributions to broader human knowledge? How could we turn to back to the longue durée in a way that addresses why people turned away from it in the first place? What should be the actual subject of archaeological history? How do objects, landscapes, materials, and other non-human entities contribute to deep histories? And how might we make room for agency and politics (if we can) in understandings of long-term change?

Unassailable as this might seem at first glance,  recent work in underclass burial grounds at the Cape and elsewhere, challenge this deathly pronouncement  by suggesting that slaves from a multiplicity of foreign homelands were incorporated into a vibrant community of free and unfree people and who nurtured them beyond their short life into the long comfort of death.

From June through mid-August archaeological excavations were conducted at the Patipampa section of Huari, Ayacucho, Peru, where prehistoric constructions are not preserved on the surface.  The goal of this first season of excavation was to detect and expose outlines of the built environment in approximately a hectare of space believed to contain primarily residential remains.  As spatial organization becomes clear, individual architectural spaces are excavated to learn about everyday lie in the capital city of Huari.  This presentation provides an overview of project and its first-year results, while also contextualizing most of the other papers constituting the symposium.

During this period, a state society emerged in the Ayacucho Valley and expanded across Peru. Even before the emergence of this state, however, culture contact of the Ayacucho heartland had already started with some remote regions in the late part of the Early Intermediate Period (EIP). This far-reaching contact would have gradually been intensified toward the beginning of the MH. Indeed, such cultural influence can be seen in Ayacucho ceramics during this transition. One good example is an EIP Ayacucho ceramic style known as ""Cruz Pata."" It has been pointed out that this particular style bears the first indication of south coast influence of the Nasca culture. Despite being important, the Cruz Pata style has been poorly defined in the literature, and it has yet to be investigated more fully so that we can better understand the arrival of Nasca influence and its ensuing impact upon the emergence of the Huari state. This paper characterizes the Cruz Pata style by examining the ceramic assemblages recovered at the site of Huari in 2017, and redefines it in relation to other Ayacucho styles.","3140","Symposium","Presenter","Hideyuki_Nishizawa",3140,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Fr-morning"

In the 2017 excavations we used methods designed to expose the upper portions of walls, in order to define architectural spaces and clarify organization of the sector. Some architectural spaces were excavated more completely, fully exposing walls and architectural features.

Our excavations revealed distinct architectural styles defined by differences in scale, construction materials, and construction techniques. Analysis shows clear linkages and relationships between structures with distinct architectural styles that are maintained across time. Differences in construction materials and techniques are frequently understood to indicate distinctions in the use and purpose of buildings, and differences in who could use those buildings. Our findings at Huari challenge these assumptions, showing that finely constructed buildings and spaces with distinct architectural features were at times integrated with more quotidian architecture.

Histories of movement shape our perceptual apparatus and generate embodied knowledge. This recursive constitution of bodies, movements, and materials simultaneously defines the challenge and opportunity of phenomenological approaches within sensory archaeology. Explicitly or not, most researchers use their own bodily experiences of movement as analogies for making inferences about the material and sensory consequences of bodily movements in the past. As imitative learning produces shared embodied knowledge among craftspeople, likewise, archaeologists can engage with movements and materials to produce some degree of intersubjectivity with bodies in the past. Drawing from archaeological and ethnographic fieldwork in western Ireland, this paper will propose simple guiding premises for undertaking a sensory archaeology of movement. To illustrate these premises, I discuss the changing material settings and practices of Irish pilgrimage and pastoralism between the medieval and modern period. I contend that interdisciplinary, collaborative research can play a vital role in refining phenomenological research by placing researchers’ subjective experiences in dialogue with descent communities, communities of practice, and relevant historical texts and imagery.","3139","Symposium","Presenter","Ryan_Lash",3139,0,5,"5","1.25",NA,"Symposium",1.25,"Fr-morning"

","Bronze Age","Other","Ritual and Symbolism","Shang (c. 1600 – 1046 BCE) elites were expert manipulators of soundscape. The intimacy of the relationship between music and authority during Bronze Age China has been well established, bronze bells having served as crucial markers of status and political prestige. Before the codification of the ritual orchestra, however, and beyond the performance of “music” per se, soundscapes were defined by factors such as climate and local ecological context, by animals, by the noise of human activity at large. As early as the Shang, soundscape was a defining component of the Chinese habitus, evidenced by the prevalence of birds imagery in ornamentation as well as the rich array of noisemakers. This paper argues that Shang elites – and particularly ritual experts –  wielded knowledge of local auditory contexts and utilized noisemakers such as rattles and jades in order to mediate between man, nature, and the ancestors. The resolution of natural cacophony through the orchestration of soundscape is an integral part of social evolution, or if one prefers, urban planning. Exploring Shang soundscapes is an opportunity to bridge scientific and humanistic approaches by combining analysis of the ecological record as well as man-made objects.","3139","Symposium","Presenter","Kirie_Stromberg",3139,0,5,"5","1.25",NA,"Symposium",1.25,"Fr-morning"

Without moving beyond the material remains and into the realm of the self-reflexive researcher (Hamilakis 2013: 119), this paper will demonstrate that archaeologists do not need to stray too far from their traditional methods to uncover rich evidence of past sensory lives. By drawing from the field of art history and linguistics, the elaborate depictions of tomb scenes from Eighteenth dynasty Egypt might truly come to life as evidence for an ancient sensory framework. In addition, these tomb scenes were not designed for the dead, but also engaged with by the living. Though these scenes were augmented by their inclusion of deceased people and other such occurrences not commonly visible to the living, the activities depicted such as banqueting or hunting were those experienced by ancient Egyptians every day. How might the visible representations of invisible sensory experiences in these scenes be reconciled with the daily life of the ancient Egyptians? This paper seeks to understand this relationship with special emphasis on the visibility of the senses and the invisibility of experience.","3139","Symposium","Presenter","Robyn_Price",3139,0,5,"5","1.25",NA,"Symposium",1.25,"Fr-morning"

The specific foodstuffs stored and consumed in civic buildings were much the same as those consumed in townhouses. However, the quantity and elaboration of foodstuffs within communal dining structures created a convivial community at Azoria.

Processes and activities such as the preparation and configuration of the floor and other earthen constructions inside the tomb are considered, as well as the rapidity of episodes of backfilling both through human and natural agency. Overall, a microcontextual approach has revealed a more complicated burial history than recognized by field observations alone. Furthermore, the identification of neoformed minerals and their chemistry has enabled the detection of degradation products of human body tissue and probably also that of some of the associated cultural objects. The genesis of these minerals reflects the sequence of the opening and filling of the tomb and their identification, therefore, contributes to a more informed reconstruction of the history of the burial. The discovery of such chemical traces has important implications for their future identification in graves and our ability to distinguish between primary and secondary burials.","3133","Symposium","Presenter","Panagiotis_Karkanas",3133,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Fr-morning"

This study (n = 275 individuals for Paphos; 94 individuals for Corinth) suggests populations that were under a certain amount of stress. Mean statures were relatively low, and rates of cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis suggest that periods of dietary deficiency were fairly common. 
Collagen stable isotope values were obtained for 34 humans and 17 comparative fauna from Corinth. Due to preservation issues, only six human values are available for Paphos. These are similar to those found for Corinth, suggesting a broadly similar diet at the two sites. Overall the human collagen values show a distinctive pattern of low d13C and high d15N compared to human values observed elsewhere in Greece. Carbon routing models and documentary evidence suggest that this pattern may reflect a largely grain- and oil-based diet whose modest protein component included marine products such as dried fish and garum.

We have observed three tentative patterns: the relative absence of materials in both natural and anthopogenic drainage areas, compounded by the downhill erosion of deposits leading to “shallow sites”; heavy clay content which is destructive for both micro- and macro-remains;  and the importance of dumping episodes in relatively undisturbed areas that had fallen out of active use. This combination of patterns means that where evidence is preserved, it is rarely in primary contexts that can be used to discuss active-use spaces. Instead, it is better suited to discussions of disposal processes that reflect general and cumulative near-by activities and long-term patterns of resource use. Nonetheless, extensive horizontal excavation at Iklaina has revealed intra-site variation perhaps related to administrative zones vs. combined-use domestic/industrial areas.

","Neolithic","Zooarchaeology","Mobility","First developing around 8,000 years ago, pastoralism in Africa has continued as a flexible and dynamic mode of subsistence. One key feature of this dynamism is mobility, which is crucial for many East African pastoralists today to access seasonally available pasture and water. In areas of unpredictable rainfall, mobile pastoralism permits more people to live in dry lands than do other subsistence strategies. How the earliest herders in Tanzania used the landscape is still relatively unknown. Recent excavations at Luxmanda provide detailed information about early pastoral lifeways in Tanzania. Situated at the southern edge of Tanzania’s Mbulu Plateau, Luxmanda is the earliest and most southern known Pastoral Neolithic site, thus providing an intriguing example of pastoral mobility strategies as herding initially took hold in Tanzania. We present the first isotopic analyses of ancient livestock in Tanzania. Carbon and oxygen stable isotope data from sequentially sampled cattle and caprine teeth provide a record of seasonal herding practices. Strontium isotopes clarify movements across distinct geologies, providing a nuanced picture of both herding over the seasonal round and possible livestock exchange among pastoral groups. Finally, these analyses throw more light on the nature of the spread of pastoralism in Africa.

Sheep from Kent exhibit an inverse relationship where low d18O values coincide with high d13C values indicating that they ingested 13C-enriched graze during the winter season. This pattern is consistent with the foddering of caprines during the winter months when they are living in sheltered valleys near the site. In contrast, sheep from Turgen exhibit diverse isotopic sequences indicating variation in husbandry practices and landscape use. This is expected, as the  site is located in a mountainous landscape with access to high elevation summer pastures, forested areas, and the semi-arid steppe.

The physical removal of California Indians from their homes was also an attempt by Spanish missionaries and soldiers to re-imagine the indigenous world. Under Mexican rule, California Indians were transferred to ranchos to perform labor in similarly poor conditions. And during the early years of California statehood in the 1860s, so-called “vagrant” laws enabled white settlers to enslave California Indians who were found “idle” on their lands. Despite these hardships necessitating great change in traditional lifeways, California Indians remained immersed in and connected to a broader Indigenous world in which colonial places and institutions were only one part.

Western epistemological traditions and the institutionalization of these understandings of the world—the academy—have constructed ideological and physical dichotomies between nature and culture, pre-contact times and post-contact times, and tribal and colonial state boundaries. Archaeologists are in a unique position to engage multiple datasets and knowledges in partnership with tribal communities to challenge these deeply rooted settler claims to intellectual and physical spaces.

Theoretical perspectives from Native American studies can help decolonize archaeological narratives to show how indigenous peoples in contact with Europeans continue their entanglements with land, ancestors, traditions and values. Archaeologists in this session use ideas developed in Indigenous and Native American studies to enrich their archaeologies with, by, and for indigenous peoples. The ideas used to clarify understanding range from Gerald Vizenor's concept of survivance to Kim TallBear's use of ""articulation"" to address genealogical and genetic arguments.

At its maximum, Chimor extended  some 1200 km. from Carabayllo north of Lima to the Zarumilla River at the modern frontier with Ecuador. It had conquered and administered polities which spoke different languages: Quingam, the Muchic-speaking  heartland of Lambayeque and Jequetepeque, and  the valleys of the far north where Tallan and Sec were spoken. South of the Santa River, Quechua may have been a common language. In this region  the economic structure differed.

In regard to the remains of soldiers who perished in the European theater during World War II (WWII), the presence of remains may serve to reinforce the perceived moral failings and criminality of other communities. However, they may also underscore the idea of victimization, even among people who might also have been considered the perpetrators of atrocities. Among the German dead from WWII, the remains themselves have highlighted the mythologized suffering of the German soldiers<U+2015>particularly in the East<U+2015>at the close of WWII, while also serving as a terrible reminder of the pain caused to the myriad communities victimized by the Reich.

A variety of ancestor rituals, work parties, and other large-scale commensal events occurred in large public spaces in high status compounds at Cerro León.

Employing intrasite spatial analysis, I explore the movements through various spaces, public and private, that provided opportunities for social interaction or restrictions on visibility and community integration. Drawing on archaeobotanical and ethnohistorical evidence, I argue that household members (likely women) primarily prepared food in private behind-the-scenes contexts for supra-household ritual events and public displays. These women may have prepared for public events totally apart from, and without being included, in such events.

 Evidence from the site of Markaqocha, in the Cusco region of Peru, both corroborates and complicates arguments that link religious and ecological conversion. At Markaqocha, archaeological, historical, and paleo-environmental data provide a lens on Inka and Colonial ritual economies. These data suggest that while the intervention of religious organizations was critical to initial attempts to convert from an Inka to Spanish political ecology, the connections this process affirmed between ritual spaces and agricultural production later prompted conflict between secular and religious institutions. Further, data from Markaqocha suggest that attempts at such a conversion were not entirely successful. The data demonstrate that pre-Colonial and Catholic ritual practices have together influenced food production in the vicinity of the site through the five centuries since the arrival of colonizers in the region.

Fueled by the dramatic recession of Lake Turkana 5300-3900 BP, which made fishing less predictable and exposed vast plains of rich pasture near the lake, early herding probably involved both in-migration of pastoralists and adoption of livestock by local fishers. As herding took hold a mortuary tradition developed, with megalithic ‘pillar sites’ serving as communal cemeteries. Construction (massive platforms, mortuary cavities >100m2 dug into sandstone bedrock, and columnar stones hauled up to 1 km from their source) and use (interment of several hundred estimated individuals over a few centuries, accompanied by adornments and intricately decorated pottery) attest to the sites’ commemorative significance. As physical landmarks and settings for unifying rituals, pillar sites would have anchored early herders within an otherwise fluid physical and social landscape as Lake Turkana retreated, rainfall diminished, and mobility increased. Periodic assembly of otherwise dispersed groups to perform ritualized interment would have facilitated diverse forms of social interaction—including information sharing, formation of exchange networks, and negotiations and strategic decisions about herd movements—essential to the success of early pastoral economies in eastern Africa.","3128","Symposium","Presenter","Elisabeth_Hildebrand",3128,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Fr-morning"

Here, new data generated from recent faunal and isotopic studies are interpreted to infer the organization of pastoral production, circulation, and consumption.  While economic and ecological models offer valuable insights into the adoption and practice of pastoralism in Gujarat, a comprehensive understanding of this process must incorporate consideration of the possible roles that livestock, especially cattle, played in the ritual life of local communities.

Food production, as a range of coordinated activities, is critical to the organization of society. Yet because it is necessary for survival, scholars often isolate it as a domain of domestic subsistence. Nonetheless, numerous ethnohistoric and modern accounts detail the important role that communal rituals had in organizing these activities, such as the intricate ritual-agricultural calendar of the Inka state or the elaborate water temple ceremonies in Bali. While these accounts articulate the sacred significance of food production practices and the collective rituals that organized them, these links are less commonly explored archaeologically. For example, although archaeologists often discuss the cultural meanings of consumption or the political economy of production-storage-redistribution cycles, few have addressed how rituals were perceived as essential to food production technologies. In turn, scholars often overlook how diverse kinds of labor, from ritual to food production, interlinked to organize ancient societies. By attending to these interconnections, papers in this symposium contribute to our anthropological knowledge of the complex practices that link people, plants, animals, land, water, and things and to address the imbrication of “sacred,” “community,” and “socioeconomic” landscapes and practices throughout the ancient world.","3128","Symposium","Chair (Primary)","Rebecca_Bria",3128,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Fr-morning"

By looking at the materiality of its intrinsic properties, we argue that the Mixtecs of Etlatongo intentionally used bedrock as part of construction episodes in the formation of a public space so that its symbolic properties were able to emerge with the building’s form and history. Considering that ethnographic accounts mention that Mixtecs understood reality as an indivisible whole animated with sacred life forces, we examine the ways in which this existential unity manifested during construction events and through the life histories of buildings; we link our Cruz B example with ethnographic practice through subsequent construction episodes at Etlatongo that illustrate the abiding interest in certain attributes of bedrock. Furthermore, we contemplate how the relational co-constitution of sediments, structures, and humans afforded the articulation of new relationships during the formation of Early Formative Etlatongo.","3126","Symposium","Presenter","Victor Emmanuel_Salazar Chavez",3126,0,10,"10","2.5",NA,"Symposium",2.5,"Fr-morning"

The history of lithic analysis has produced many assumptions and interpretations regarding exchange, use and control of this extremely important material. Obsidian itself, as an imported resource, might have had otherworldly properties that held a special place in the cosmological construction of the world for villagers in the Valley of Oaxaca. The power of higher status community members may have been channeled through these distinct and imported materials, including obsidian. The recent excavations at Etlatongo, in the Mixteca Alta, have provided an opportunity to test these models and utilize new theoretical perspectives. Samples of obsidian excavated at Etlatongo, from both domestic and public space, demonstrate long distant relationships that the village, and specific households, may have developed in order to procure obsidian. We also explore the crafting of the material itself. Etlatongo also gives us the opportunity to systematically test distribution and frequency levels throughout the site, to determine if there was any control or redistribution over certain obsidian sources, which would be indicative of the economic and other-worldly importance of obsidian at Early Formative Etlatongo.

","Neolithic","Remote Sensing/Geophysics","Settlement Patterns","The Qujiang drains mountainous terrain in Zhejiang Province of east-central China. Shangshan cultures have been identified on floodplain terraces and earth mounds within the Qujiang valley. The choice of settlement in the area (10,000+ years BP) is constrained by several geographical factors, including topography, climate, access to water resources and human factors. The relationship between cultural occupation sites and river dynamics over the Holocene is poorly known in this region. Lateral and vertical river stability can be an important determinate of land use and settlement patterns. We investigate the geomorphic record of the Qujiang in relation to the Hehuashan river terrace occupation site using geophysical methods (GPR) and cores on the adjacent floodplain to infer long-term floodplain stability. Floodplain structure is dominated by shallow narrow channels comprised of basal gravels and sand (   4 m depth), overlain by horizontally laminated infilled silty sands. We interpret the long-term natural channel pattern of the Qujiang to be a cobble-bedded, sandy anabranched river, subject to rapid and frequent lateral channel shifting and formation of large back-swamps during heavy flooding. This suggests poor habitat for occupation on the river’s floodplain and supports settlement on the adjacent Pleistocene aged river terraces.","3123","Symposium","Presenter","Anna Marie_Soleski",3123,0,9,"9","2.25",NA,"Symposium",2.25,"Fr-morning"

Is Kuahuqiao Culture truly the descendant of Shangshan or an independent culture that had come from the continental shelf that is submerged by ocean now?

The Shangshan culture established substantial communities in elevated (40-100 m above sea level), intermountain river valleys well away from where the Kuahuqiao and Hemudu cultures eventually became established. Questions being addressed include what economically supported the occupations, how settlements were organized, the function and palaeoecology of substantial ditches at several Shangshan sites, the process of rice domestication, the meaning and technical skills behind the many forms of Shangshan pottery (including fibre tempered and thin, painted/slipped ware), and the relationships the occupations had with each other and to subsequent cultural developments in Zhejiang Province

","Intermediate Area","Other","History of Archaeology","This paper presents a brief overview over past and current trends in non-Maya archaeology of Honduras. From the beginnings of archaeological investigations in Honduras, there has been a strong research focus on the Maya city of Copan in the extreme west of the country. But already in early years, pioneers like William D. Strong, Doris Stone and Claude Baudez made valuable contributions, in order to reveal the hidden history of central Honduras, the Atlantic and the Pacific coast. The lack of research in these regions of Honduras in the following years, due to the ongoing interest in the influence of the Maya culture in western Honduras, and also to the difficult sociopolitical situation, resulted in an imbalance of archaeological research which today prevents the understanding of cultural processes between Mesoamerica and Lower Central America.
In recent years, new archaeological projects were started which reveal the great potential of research in the hitherto less studied regions. A well trained new generation of archaeologist is using new methodologies and technologies to systematically study settlement patterns, regional chronologies and intercultural relations. This new research results in the definition of new strategies for archaeological research in Honduras in the future.","3122","Symposium","Presenter","Markus_Reindel",3122,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Fr-morning"

Fifty-three years later, this article still constitutes one of the most extensive descriptions of the ceramic assemblage of the Honduran side of the Gulf. However, research in the surrounding regions of the Gulf in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras, has considerably advanced in the last thirty years, and contributed to a better understanding of ceramic types and their distribution. Through a renewed analysis of a sample of the ceramic material excavated by Baudez in the Gulf of Fonseca and a review of his typology, my paper presents updated considerations about distribution of ceramic types present in the Gulf of Fonseca between the Classic and Late Post-Classic periods, with a focus on the Late and Terminal Classic. To this end, recent research and established typologies are reviewed and compared as an attempt to create relations and equivalences between types, leading to better understanding of local variations.

With its location inside the interaction sphere between Mesoamerica, Lower Central America and the Caribbean, it lies within a culturally dynamic region that has received influences from various areas during different times. With respect to the Postclassic period, it has been demonstrated that access and distribution patterns of resources and goods changed and new networks of interaction emerged. Communication routes along the coast gained importance. In Guadalupe, many objects were found that point to cultural and economic relations with Mesoamerica and Lower Central America, suggesting that the settlement might have functioned as a coastal trading center.

","Intermediate Area","Remote Sensing/Geophysics","Landscape Archaeology","In response to the widespread destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, the US Geological Survey conducted an extensive survey of 15 modern cities in Honduras. This 2000 survey was carried out by the Bureau of Economic Geology of the University of Texas, and the resultant data were used to generate flood risk maps. The survey also produced the first lidar data collection of a Maya site; however, in the early 2000s, lidar algorithms were not capable of performing the same tasks as today. The final elevation rasters that were archived by the USGS were low resolution and had very basic ground/non-ground classification which made archaeological interpretation difficult. Over the past two years semi-raw lidar data was recovered from old magnetic tapes. We have been able to reprocess these data using current algorithms at a level suitable for archaeological investigation. The newly processed data provides unique insight into Honduran archaeological sites as well as settlement patterns throughout a large part of the country. This paper discusses these lidar data from better-known locations such as Copan, the Sula and Comayagua Valleys, and from less-studied areas along the Atlantic Coast, the Aguan and Olancho Valleys, and the southern gulf of Fonseca region.","3122","Symposium","Presenter","Juan C._Fernandez Diaz",3122,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Fr-morning"

The belief that the periphery was occupied by simple non-Maya societies, lightly “influenced” by their more civilized western neighbors, appeared early in the development of orthodox frameworks and continues to influence archaeological perspectives. The advent of World Systems Theory and other core-periphery perspectives brought an interest in the character of the relationships but little advance in attention to the material remains that might reflect the supposed derivative nature of frontier cultural patterns.  

Understanding interaction requires methodologies that move beyond unilateral region-to-region or community-to-community connections and focus instead on the development of innovative approaches to documenting multiple overlapping networks connecting many groups within many communities.

A large portion of the research in the western region has been devoted to understanding both the Maya and non-Maya populations living along the border, yet very little is known about the groups living just beyond the edge of ancient Mesoamerica. Certainly, some groups in the rest of Honduras were influenced by the Maya and other Mesoamerican groups. Increasingly, influences from Lower Central America and the Caribbean are also being demonstrated. Given these diverse and often overlapping influences, current and future research in eastern, central, and southern Honduras necessitates communication across regions and borders. With this need in mind, this session aims to bring together scholars currently involved in research in these understudied portions of Honduras. The goals of the session are to provide insights into recently initiated research projects in these areas, share current findings and results, and discuss common themes in future research questions and strategies.","3122","Symposium","Chair (Primary)","Whitney_Goodwin",3122,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Fr-morning"

This paper combines aspects of each of these interests. Cemeteries associated with Indian mounds commonly occur in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. Numerous reasons have been put forth over the years as to why early Anglo-American settlers decided to bury their dead on mounds, ranging from flooding issues, to avoidance of valuable farmland, to a preference for burying on high land. The fact that a number of mound sites along the bluffs of western Mississippi also have non-Indian cemeteries on them, despite even higher land occurring nearby, suggests that the story is far more complex than perceived. I suggest here that the use of mounds for burial purposes may be related to early nineteenth-century Anglo-American populations having made symbolic power statements over land that was still either being occupied or claimed by Indians. The erection of gravestones on prehistoric mounds targeted what were clearly the most visible and curious monuments of this contested landscape.

Archaeology courses that discuss climate change typically bring together data from the physical sciences, such as from ice or lake cores, with archaeological evidence of social change, such as shifting settlement patterns or food strategies. Though an understanding of these links is critical to scientific literacy and knowledge about the past, we suggest that an ethnographic perspective can deeply enrich student learning by revealing social processes beyond subsistence-based adaptations. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in rural communities in Peru, we first review how local people perceive the causes and effects of climate change, including through the lens of religious belief. Second, we draw on archaeological and available ice core evidence from the region that reveal how ancient people adapted to shifting flows of water: an ongoing process that continues today. Ultimately, we suggest that the diverse kinds of knowledge that ethnography, archaeology, and paleoclimatology produce—and the multiple ways of knowing the world that each provides—is essential for students to consider when learning about not only what happened during moments of climate change in the past, but how societies creatively responded.","3120","Symposium","Presenter","Doris_Walter",3120,1,10,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Fr-morning"

At its completion, the tunnel measured 4,263ft long and bridged two Virginia counties. This project proved to be an especially daunting task that took ten years to complete and cost many lives. Workers and their families nearby were forced to live in groups of shanty homes, prone to regular outbreaks of disease throughout construction. In 2011, a local non-profit organization, focused on pinpointing the remains of these Irish shanty homes, contacted the University of Maryland to see if an archaeological survey could aid their search. Over the course of two years, archaeological research shed light on the material culture of transient labor and reinforced strong community ties related to the surrounding cultural landscape.

Settlers on the Wisconsin frontier in the mid-to-late 19th century had limited access to formal health care. Physicians who did provide services to remote populations were often poorly trained and had a limited understanding of the causes of many diseases. Thus, self-medication and alternative forms of health care became an attractive option for many frontier occupants. As a result of rapid industrialization during this period, many groups of immigrants were forced to abandon their ancestral ethnic identities and assimilate to a more homogeneous capitalistic American culture. This paper illustrates how patent medicine bottles recovered from the McHugh site provide an indication of how the McHugh family responded to the need for health care under the harsh conditions of frontier life in northeastern Wisconsin during the mid-to-late 19th century. Moreover, this analysis shows how broadly changing social conditions as well as the emergence of American popular culture may have shaped how the McHughs conceptualized ideas of sickness and disease.","3117","Symposium","Presenter","Robert_Vander Heiden",3117,1,14,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Fr-morning"

This project investigates how these industrially produced consumer products became woven into the social, religious, and cultural fabric of daily life in the Irish island communities of Inishark and Inishbofin from the late 18th century to the present day. Recent archaeological investigations by the Cultural Landscapes of the Irish Coast project on Inishark and Inishbofin, combined with the oral history of island residents, will further an understanding of the significant ways that mass-produced consumer goods were meaningfully incorporated into island life through the collection of delph (ceramics) on household dressers, and consumption of tobacco pipes in everyday life and during traditional Irish wakes.

Race and low “moral character” were blamed for the endemic poverty of the island. The Irish poor were portrayed as a “race apart” whose inherent failings were at least partly to blame for the mortality they suffered during the Great Famine of 1845–1852. Recent excavations at Kilkenny workhouse and Spike Island convict prison have produced skeletal assemblages from this critical period. These collections have enabled bioarchaeological analysis of parameters mentioned by the Victorians as indicative of the distinctiveness of the Irish poor: stature, interpersonal violence, and tobacco-use. We argue that the differences between Irish and British populations in stature and risk of violence were exaggerated. Such characterizations, we suggest, were part of a strategy of “othering” that served to legitimize colonial domination.

Since tea is consumed by cultures across the world, the presence of teaware alone is not enough to indicate “Irishness.” Thus, this study explores the correlates of the material manifestation of tea consumption within the McHugh household and offers a comparison with selected contemporary sites as well as modern Irish and Irish American households.

Heritage legislation regarding the protection of pre-Columbian archaeological materials continues to be weak. Despite the bureaucratic control over international scientific research, there are no local regulatory mechanisms that register the sale of archaeological objects by street vendors, huaqueros, or between private collectors that continue, at a lesser but impactful rate, to expand their collections, prestige, and market value.

The artistic heritage of the pre-Columbian Caribbean still remains largely understudied, with far smaller-scale production than seen in neighbouring regions like Mexico and Peru (with their own long-established, highly prolific forgers) – two of a number of factors that have led not only to site looting but entrepreneurial ‘reinterpretations’ of ancient artforms, both aimed at filling voids in private collections. These neo-artforms eventually enter museum collections, and are published in glossy catalogues as the genuine article, perpetuating the continuation of a particular forger’s oeuvre, cementing it as an established, ancient ‘style’, and so skewing understanding of past artistic expressions and meanings.

In 2014, the Carriacou Archaeology Project (University of Oregon; University of London) excavated a unique stone zemi at the Grand Bay site on the island of Carriacou, Grenada. The decision was made to create casts of the zemi in order to facilitate simultaneous display of the object in multiple island museums. It was hoped this would allow both museums to advocate the small island of Carriacou as a site of particular archaeological significance, to stimulate scientific tourism and promote the research potential of the island to post-graduates.
However, the making of the casts has raised some potentially problematic issues. The original intention was that the museums would display the casts correctly labelled as copies. This has not happened, raising the question as to whether or not the casts are moving from being mere “replicas” to being fakes: copies which deceive - however unintentionally or benignly. And because the casts increase the “visibility” of the original they are adding new layers of economic and aesthetic value to the original – with potential implications for theft, forgery and looting.","3093","Symposium","Presenter","John_Swogger",3093,0,7,"7","1.75",NA,"Symposium",1.75,"Fr-morning"

","Other","Cultural Resources and Heritage Management","Iconography and Art","Authenticating relations are defined by artisanship, temporality, value-making and ethnographic authority. These relations are visible in contemporary museum settings as well as in the art world as such, and may be particularly poignant in the case of the Caribbean and Central America with its diverse manifestations of emotive styles and materials such as wood and stone. Historically deep and widespread, 19th and 20th century Central American trafficking of pre-Columbian things was tied to foreign-owned plantations and centred on San Jose, Costa Rica, leading to a scarcity of a ‘Nicaragua’ provenance indicator in current-day museum signage. Eventually, archaeology emerged from such uncontrolled collecting and now works to counter looting, yet market demand for objects remains stable. 
This paper explores the ongoing resilience of authenticity and its persistence in the global art market. I argue that this is in part due to the ascribed inspirational value Amerindian objects hold in modern art, as argued in the notion of primitivism. Primitivist art is seen in opposition to modernity, ascribing it legitimacy through temporal or cultural distance. With some exceptions, programs focussed on revitalizing artisanship and producing high-quality copies or working on stylistic and technical innovations are countered by rendering this primitive authenticity.

","Other","Cultural Resources and Heritage Management","Cultural Heritage and Preservation","Collectors of antiquities have long sought the ornate pottery and carved wood and stonework of the pre-Columbian Caribbean - a quick search for “Saladoid” or “Taino” on internet gallery/auction sites shows a thriving black market. Its scale has remained largely unexplored, to the detriment of regional and international archaeology and museology. In response to the increasingly growing market, various attempts have been made to discourage looting via replica workshops, community archaeology, and other interventions. Many efforts prove unsustainable, however, and in some cases participants were left with the skills to both identify Amerindian remains and create forgeries that eventually end up on display in museums. This symposium will examine the unintended consequences, cautionary tales, and lessons learned from an often overlooked – but highly prolific - region of the antiquities market. In the process, we will illuminate new understandings and strategies for both combating the global antiquities trade and encouraging sustainable economic impacts for those who make a living creating new art forms, inspired by the past yet reinterpreted for the present.","3093","Symposium","Chair (Primary)","Joanna_Ostapkowicz",3093,0,7,"7","1.75",NA,"Symposium",1.75,"Fr-morning"

As an interpretive discipline, the views and experiences of archaeologists undoubtedly frame our understanding of the past. Consequently, having diverse archaeological practitioners is equally as important as having diverse methodological and theoretical approaches. Despite the fact that most archaeologists are employed by CRM firms, government agencies, museums, or community-based institutions, much of this discussion has occurred within and around academic environments. This panel will focus its discussion on how we can bring diversity to the forefront of non-academic archaeological practice by considering the following questions:
-What does inclusive archaeology look like when the work is client-based?
-How do we diversify the discipline, particularly in the areas of CRM, government, and museum archaeology?
-How do people’s experiences of racism, homophobia, and sexism influence whether or not they pursue professional archaeology? 
-What programs and initiatives are currently in place that focus on outreach and education to minority groups? 
The panel will encourage the audience to discuss these questions and generate ideas about how to make archaeology a more inclusive, engaged community.

The move from a riverine to upland setting involved a dramatic shift in practices of historical ecology. The rich soils and open terrain of the prairie system at the time of European contact were likely a result of repeated burning and other modifications by ancestral Chickasaw, leading to an early description of the countryside as “pleasant open forests of oak chesnuts and hickory so intermixt with savannas as if it were a made landskape.” Our work describes how the historical ecology of migration was an outgrowth of climate change, regional social tensions, and the later arrival of Europeans.","3075","Symposium","Presenter","Charles_Cobb",3075,0,11,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Fr-morning"

In this talk we present data from two ongoing research endeavors being carried out by the Undocumented Migration Project (UMP) that focus on these troubling issues. One is a photoethnography of Honduran migrants and smugglers crossing Mexico that seeks to understand the dangerous geography people must traverse en route to the US/Mexico border. The other is a forensic project that uses a range of survey and laboratory techniques to improve our ability to recover corpses from remote parts of the border and reconstruct the geographic origin and ante-mortem movement of unidentified bodies. Because of the complicated and clandestine nature of migrant movement and death, we posit that new and innovative ways of combining anthropological approaches are crucial to documenting these processes and raising awareness about this ongoing humanitarian crisis and the role that U.S. policy plays in border crosser deaths.","3075","Symposium","Presenter","Jason_De Leon",3075,0,11,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Fr-morning"

This study presents mtDNA results from 50 prehistoric individuals dated to ca. 6,000-390BP. The results identify three main haplogroups (C1, D1, and D4h3a) which distribution suggest the presence of at least two migration routes into the region, one through the inland and east of the Andes, and one through the coast, along the Pacific.

Inspired by archaeological data showing pulses in monument construction and settlement—indicators of territorial behavior—we argue that pastoral ecosystems are non-linear and cycle between more open and more closed regimes while grazing land cycles between more and less productive states due to changes in population and cover.

The initial human migration into the New World is an early human dispersal that has become a focal point in mobility research that strives to understand the impacts that climactic change and shifting environments have on human’s ability to successfully migrate and adapt to new lands.

Recent investigations have typically focused on the greening of Arabia and demographic response to increased landscape carrying capacity as the Indian Ocean Intertropical Convergence Zone shifted northward. Here we consider the inverse: what were the effects of increasing aridity on the environment and inhabitants of Arabia at the end of the Holocene Climatic Optimum? The current state of South Arabian early Neolithic archaeological and genetic research is summarized, superimposed over the palaeoenvironmental record describing a series of century scale megadroughts between ˜8,000 and 5,500 BP.

Drawing primarily on economic and behavioral ecology models, these studies have focused on subsistence strategies, carrying capacity, resource over-exploitation, extinctions, diet and health, and related questions such as the translocation of species. Food is integral to non-economic, social and cultural processes, though, and some anthropologists and food historians would argue that food is culture. The purpose of this forum is to discuss food-related issues such as identity and cuisine, performance, cultural taboos, status and social differentiation (i.e. the relationship between cuisine and social position), the symbolic meanings of some foods, creolization or transculturation, resistance and many others processes in the Caribbean’s ancient and recent pasts. It is our hope that this conversation will challenge us to start looking at our food data in new terms. Discussion will also include planning a 2019 SAA session, and, second, the production of a publication addressing these issues.","3071","Forum","Moderator (Primary)","L.

To this end, urban archaeology often requires peeking beneath parking lots, which often provide temporary protection to buried resources until the land is slated for development. The changing dynamics of an evolving city may mean that beneath the parking lot archaeological resources are buried beneath extensive fill deposits. Conversely, they may have been destroyed by extensive grading.

Our research over the last six field seasons indicates that some residential groups were settled at Tlalancaleca towards 800 BC and the settlement was urbanized with a significant population growth during the later Middle Formative period (ca. 650-500 BC); the city experienced large-scale urban transformations during the Late Formative (ca. 500-100 BC) and a subsequent and final urban expansion during the Terminal Formative (ca. 100 BC-AD 250). Tlalancaleca’s long occupational history overlaps with that of Chalcatzingo as well as Teotihuacan and, thus, provides a unique opportunity to address long-term social transformations during the Formative period.

In previous papers, I have presented stylistic evidence for interaction between La Consentida and potters from distant West Mexican traditions such as Capacha and Opeño. While some of La Consentida’s decorated Tlacuache phase vessels suggest involvement in a system of long-distance interaction along Mesoamerica’s Pacific coast, more utilitarian wares such as globular jars and undecorated hemispherical bowls imply affiliations closer to home, specifically with Early Formative period highland assemblages of the Espiridión, Tierras Largas, and Purrón phases. In this paper, I discuss formal similarities between highland pottery and La Consentida’s Tlacuache phase assemblage. On the basis of these affiliations, I propose a model in which La Consentida’s diverse ceramics are explained as partly the result of the cooperating or even conflicting emphases of overlapping interaction spheres: one along the Pacific coast and one tying the coast to the southern and central Mesoamerican highlands. These patterns suggest that people at La Consentida both maintained some traditional practices of Red-on-Buff potters in adjacent regions and self-consciously participated in a coastal interaction network involving more superficial decorative styles.","3060","Symposium","Presenter","Guy_Hepp",3060,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Fr-morning"

It examines the construction techniques used for monument building (including talud-tablero facades), the degree of urban planning, and the temporal relationship between monumental construction and the urban development based on new radiocarbon dates. Preliminary analysis suggests that monumental construction and reconstruction was heightened during the Terminal Formative period and was associated with urban expansion after the eruption of Popocatepetl around AD 50. While there was no central avenue at Tlalancaleca, we have noted a certain degree of standardization of main axes for monumental building.

This presentation marks the maturation of 3D photogrammetry at Pacbitun. The integration of 3D data with differential GPS positional data allows for data processed using photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques to be integrated into existing GIS data. By acquiring images in a rule-based manner, the overall number of images can be optimized to balance between number of images needed and photogrammetric coverage. Reducing the overall number of images while maximizing coverage will allow for models to be produced more efficiently, and with great overall accuracy. Improved spatial control, updated software and enhanced image acquisition techniques have allowed photogrammetry at Pacbitun to mature from an experiment to a critical recordation tool.

","Maya: Classic","Paleoethnobotany","Material Culture and Technology","Material culture studies allow archaeologists to examine the social implications of the physical world in which people are embedded. Sacred landscapes, for example, inspire social narratives regarding how people should interact with the environment. Components of those landscapes, such as caves and mountains, become active participants in the establishment, maintenance, and mobilization of environmental narratives. They serve as hegemonic tools for conveying morality and proper behavior, and as such they are prone to appropriation by those in power. Using archaeological data from the Maya site of Pacbitun, this paper seeks to understand how materialized narratives are part of broader networks of power used to reinforce and challenge dominant hegemony. The presence of elite-sponsored constructions near caves act as overt manifestations of environmental narratives seeking to situate the community as a unified whole. Yet, studying ritually deposited offerings in Pacbitun’s caves reveals differences in ceremonial practice. These deposits inform about the day to day concerns of individuals, their socioeconomic status and differential access to power.","3049","Symposium","Presenter","Megan_Parker",3049,1,14,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Fr-morning"

The papers in this session will be a summary of the previous and on-going research efforts at Pacbitun. Current research explores Pacbitun’s modes of production and trade networks as it straddles the Belize Valley and Mountain Pine Ridge resource areas. Additionally, research efforts chart the use of environmental resources and the reshaping of the environmental topography.  Expanding on earlier studies, excavations into plaza space have increased our understanding of the domiciles and production spaces of the site’s earliest inhabitants while also adding a ceremonial dimension to their cultural repertoire. Other investigations have focused on Pacbitun’s elite community and the events of the Classic period through an examination of residential, ceremonial, and causeway architecture. Finally, through the application of LiDAR and photogrammetry, we continue to technologically enhance our research capabilities.

My own research on the Aventura ceramics, begun in 2015 as part of the Aventura Archaeology Project, supports Joe Ball’s early observations on Classic Period ceramics in Northern Belize. Furthermore, his important definitions of ceramic spheres and systems provide an excellent way to frame Aventura’s long chronology and inter-regional connections through time. While still in its preliminary stages, I am hopeful that continuing work on the ceramics of Aventura will go beyond establishing a site and regional chronology, and highlighting inter-site connections, to telling us something more about “ancient Maya economic systems, political history, ceremonial behavior, ideology, societal structure, and community organization.” (Ball 1993)

What is the point of analyzing hundreds and thousands of small, broken pieces of pottery?  This paper explores these, and other questions, within the context of Classic Maya civilization.  Too often, it seems, ceramic analysis is used as a loose chronological framework, used solely to construct broad frameworks of relative dating.  These frameworks are then applied to archaeological assemblages, placing them within chronologically bounded “ceramic complexes” and geographically bounded “ceramic spheres.”  Then most ceramic analyses end.  This paper argues that this is the point where real ceramic analysis should begin.  Ceramic complexes should be broken down into distinct centuries and even individual decades, if possible.  Ceramic analysis can be used to create absolute chronologies.  Ceramic spheres can be subdivided, revealing the exchange of material culture between individual cities, communities, and households.  Thus, ceramic analysis can shed significant light on cultural, social, economic, and political ties on such material exchanges.  Such analysis can de shown by examining the recent work at El Perú-Waka’, where internal social, political, and economic ties are shown, within the context of an absolute chronology.","3039","Symposium","Presenter","Keith_Eppich",3039,0,15,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Fr-morning"

Research suggests that a “middle” status group exists. However, the social segment from which they arise is unknown. This study focuses on individuals from the urban center of Buenavista del Cayo who are below the ruling elites in the “middle” rungs of social status, and those from the neighboring farming community of Guerra who are recognized as nonelites. Previous research suggested that no biological affinity existed between the ruling elite and the “middle” status groups. Thus, we hypothesized that there would be a biological connection between the “middle” status group and the nonelites at these sites. Our study used a bio-cultural approach to interpret social connections by comparing dental characteristics (crown size and trait expression) and archaeological evidence to assess whether there was biological affinity between these two social groups. Our results indicate that there was shared affinity, suggesting that middle status individuals maintained biological and cultural ties with the nonelite group. Thus, the evidence in this study suggests that kinship, or biological affinity, was the basis for the social structure, organization, and membership patterns of these Maya communities during the Classic period.

Archaeological Palynology is a well understood method for addressing these questions. Because of the constant pollen rain and the purposeful and incidental ingestion of pollen and spores, well-preserved pollen is repeatedly found in association with human habitation sites and human artifacts. Paisley Caves, Oregon, established itself as one such early human habitation site when human DNA was found in coprolites dating to the oldest associated with humans in America. In addition, the sediments within caves at the site contain an abundance of well-preserved pollen. Knowing more about the environment reflected by the sediments at Paisley Caves can tell us more about the people who lived there, the lives they led, and the obstacles they faced as they ventured into the undiscovered American continent. However, the cave setting as well as the presence of packrat coprolites, thoroughly mixed within the sediments, adds levels of complexity that makes the sediment at Paisley Caves a unique interpretive challenge.

The well-preserved animal and plant record facilitates the archaeological study of diet and subsistence strategies through time. The examinations of faunal remains of seabirds, sea mammals, and mollusk shells support the expected marine-oriented subsistence strategy. However, the site also contains a long record of botanical remains suggesting that people had access to plant resources. For this reason, a study of fossil pollen grains and macrobotanical remains have been carried out with the focus on reconstructing the paleoethnobotanical record of Gramalote. These two botanical proxies help to identify the relationships between humans and plants in this region of northern Peru during the second millennium B.C.  Grasses; reeds; food, woody and wild plants were identified suggesting an environment that allowed small-scale agriculture and a trading network during the Initial Period of Gramalote. The availability of these plant resources complemented the diet rich in marine proteins that these fishermen had in the northern coast of Peru.

As largely substrate-specific in nature, fungal spores may serve as proxy for a range of phenomena, such as soil erosion, landscape burning, vegetation clearance, moisture availability, and the existence of particular plant types in a given area. Microbotanicals, including pollen, fungal spores, phytoliths, and microcharcoal, isolated from a 2.5 meter sediment core recovered from Kingwal Swamp in western Kenya are used here to demonstrate the value of fungal palynomorphs as environmental indicators, particularly when employed in concert with these more traditional proxy types. I illustrate how cross-checking of palynological interpretations with fungal data can be used to refine models of landscape change and increase interpretive confidence via the elimination of equifinal trajectories potentially responsible for observed archaeological and paleoecological data patterning. Examination of congruence, or lack thereof, between these lines of evidence can thus render past human ecological impacts more easily visible.","3113","Symposium","Presenter","Ryan_Szymanski",3113,0,11,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Th-evening"

However, they can be indicators of various environmental changes such as fluctuations in plant and animal communities, erosion and fire events. This paper demonstrates the utility of fungal spores as paleoenvironmental proxies at two submerged sites in the Southeastern United States: Page-Ladson, Florida and White Pond, South Carolina. Non-pollen palynomorph assemblages at these sites provide evidence of considerable disturbances to vegetation, including fires, grazing and browsing regimes, and periods of erosion. Of particular interest are the coprophilous fungal spores, which indicate a decline in megaherbivores at both sites by ~12,600 cal BP. The information provided by non-pollen palynomorphs can enhance other paleoenvironmental data to further contextualize cultural adaptations of Terminal Pleistocene peoples.","3113","Symposium","Presenter","Angelina_Perrotti",3113,0,11,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Th-evening"

One of the impacts of being a sideline speciality is the lack of structured training programs to develop the botanical knowledge  alongside a standard curriculum in archaeology. Most undergraduates receive basic training in lithic or ceramic identification during field schools. However, paleoethnobotanical skills are not as frequently taught. Most training in paleoethnobotany has taken the form of a mentorship, often at great personal cost to the student.

Tools produced are characterized by flake-core reduction strategies. The combined visual characteristics of the source material and technology employed are important chronological indicators. But, general similarities in the appearance of the raw material and factors such as variable thickness create the potential for overlap with other sources, such as Pico de Orizaba, though the latter tends to have fewer inclusions, making it more suitable for the production of prismatic blades than Guadalupe Victoria obsidian. Thus, the presence of clear-to-light-gray material in flake form is typically assigned to the Guadalupe Victoria source, whereas clear-to-light-gray material in blade form is often attributed to Pico de Orizaba. The presence of clear-to-light gray material in flake form throughout the occupational sequence of Pre-Classic and Classic period Matacanela challenged existing ideas about the efficacy of visual designation. As a result, we used pXRF to examine the entire assemblage of visually sourced Guadalupe Victoria material from excavated contexts to evaluate our accuracy in predicting source material.

Chaîne opératoire analysis shows that, while obsidian sources (Zaragoza-Oyameles for prismatic blades and Pico de Orizaba for percussion flakes), core types and knapping techniques are identical across the survey region, there is a high incidence and a wide variety of knapping errors. The evidence reflects a well established procurement system coupled to a low degree of specialization, which opens the possibility of a third alternative: state procurement of raw material (acquired using surplus of commercial staple like cotton, cacao, or rubber), with limited individual household access and production of artifacts.

Previous research on obsidian production found a spatial association with Sauce, which could support political administration of exchange, or alternatively, identify market exchange nearby. Reliance on spatially based models alone for identifying exchange mechanisms are flawed based on equifinality, in which different forms of exchange result in the same spatial pattern. Local chipped stone artifacts have further complications to interpretation: singular geological source, universal access, and potential specialized activities. No single model will identify all competing influences on residential inventories. To handle this complexity, I use the articulation of production combined with the spatial distribution and contextual information to distinguish between redistribution and market exchange. Results indicate that market exchange was the main mechanism.

Currently, only two geomasking techniques are widely used in archaeology: aggregating archaeological site locations into grids or administrative units, or placing points that represent site locations at a particular distance from their true locations. These techniques, while useful, are part of a larger and growing suite of tools that visually convey spatial data without revealing sensitive site locations.

While there are computer databases for the site forms, bibliographic entries, maps, and artifacts, there is variability in the extent to which all records have been added to these databases. Arduous and labor intensive, the process of digitizing our records has evolved with the available technology and been limited by staffing. Our goal is to have this data in GIS and electronic databases accessible to researchers and easy to query. We will discuss our efforts to reach this goal and the potential benefits of digitizing our records.

We might think of ceramics as landscape “caught in a flash”, a bringing together of different geological places into newly combined forms. Ecological thinking in Northern Rio Grande Pueblos frames this bringing together as a fluid gathering of forces that flow in and out of one another. “Deep ecology” is one current term the social sciences for this relational field of human and non-human interaction in the landscape— for Pueblo potters, it is how the world is. 

This paper outlines a deep ecology of pottery from a Spanish land grant community and a neighboring Tiwa Pueblo. I present ongoing research on the composition of ceramics from these two places, a study that gives insight into how different communities engaged with the landscape. Comparative ceramic ecology offers a framework for thinking about historical relationships that includes but also moves beyond questions of ethnicity and identity to a focus on how people locate themselves within socio-environmental systems.","3106","Symposium","Presenter","Valerie_Bondura",3106,1,14,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Th-evening"

This landscape, however, lends itself to narratives that use trees as artifacts, among the full breadth of survey data, to consider its histories. Performing a landscape archaeology that takes these living artifacts of a visible food practice seriously raises questions for the process of looking at the landscape, by which trees become a powerful, if transient, player in a trajectory of landscape-based practices surrounding sustenance and sweetness on the northern Rio Grande.

The animal species highlighted within the case study of the kiva includes the North American porcupine, the American crow, the American bison, and four domesticated dog burials.

Knowledge of materials and the ecological processes with which they were thoroughly entangled encouraged hunters to lay down tracks and traces of their own, including the geometric patterns and animal and bird prints that constitute the archaic rock art tradition of the area. The rock art appears as either isolated, often barely visible, communications with the heavily patinated basalt surfaces on which it is pecked; or as sites that are made up of the dense iterative marks left by itinerant hunters, marks that transformed boulders, reshaping them in line with the natural ecologies of which they are a part. Through a consideration of several sites investigated by members of the Gorge Archaeological Project in the light of recent work on ecology and hunter-prey relations, this paper examines the ways in which rock art exists on a continuum with other, older practices, rather than being indicative of a moment of radical separation.","3106","Symposium","Presenter","Benjamin_Alberti",3106,1,14,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Th-evening"

The ubiquity of canine burials attests to their historical role as complex social actors in human society, prompting actions and performances, taboos and transgressions. To access the true depth of meaning in many canine remains, then, we must examine them with the level of precision normally reserved for human burials. This paper offers a close reading of the remains of four dogs buried in Room 822, a D-shaped kiva from T’aitöna (Pot Creek Pueblo). These dogs were ritually buried and show evidence of having been skinned before interment. The cultural significance of skins and dogs is analyzed in this paper through engagements with both descendant oral histories and folklore, as well as the theory of Amerindian perspectivism best known through the writings of Viveiros de Castro. When viewed through these lenses, the taphonomic evidence of skinning provides an important new understanding of the social and ritual role of dogs in the pre-colonial Southwest and argues for the importance of dogs as culturally rich participants in the human past.","3106","Symposium","Presenter","Madeleine_Strait",3106,1,14,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Th-evening"

More recent studies have worked to incorporate indigenous voices into scholarly understandings of the landscape. So far, less attention has been paid to the way Hispano communities in New Mexico experienced and interacted with the landscape during the colonial period. Early accounts by Spanish colonists indicate that they brought wheat, lentils, melons, garlic, and other Old World cultivars with them. While these accounts indicate the colonists were growing the cultivars, previous archaeological work has produced limited evidence for the growth and use of these plants.

Recently, post-humanist thinking has gained popularity as an approach, urging us to think about human and non-humans relationally, as having contingent qualities that vary in relation to their interaction over time. Simultaneously, we see increasing attempts to think with indigenous philosophies and descendent communities about what the environment is and does. However, there remains a disconnect between approaches that seek to include indigenous philosophies and/or post-humanist approaches, and much work of the ecological sciences which are developing at a rapid pace, providing greater precision and clarity of information. This paper considers the history of archaeology’s relationship to the idea and study of ecology, and proposes the concept of “Deep Ecologies” as an approach to human-nonhuman interactive pasts that offers the opportunity to bridge some of these perceived divides, while also being attentive to the politics of attempts to do so and the appropriative histories of archaeological work in this vein.

Unfortunately, this visibility and engagement on the Reservation is in stark contrast to the archaeology of Native Americans elsewhere in the region. Interweaving Pamunkey perspectives, opinions and memories with ethnographic and archaeological research, this paper contextualizes tribal members’ reuse and reimagining of the Reservation’s archaeological record throughout the past century. Recognizing that the purpose, use and meaning of the archaeological record are varied among Native communities, the research conducted with the Pamunkey community demonstrates those various perceptions can aid archaeologists in our interpretations of the archaeological and material records.","3105","Symposium","Presenter","Ashley_Atkins Spivey",3105,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Th-evening"

Historic sites are spaces where national and personal identities are dynamically produced and negotiated.  Ideals of equity and realities of disparity may be brought into relief (or not) by telescoping the past into the space and place of the present.  These connections between past and present lives and identities are often made most salient through sites bearing artifacts interpreted through archaeology.  The authority of material culture and even more so, human remains, can profoundly transform understandings of space as having a contested past critically connected to socio-political and economic systems of the present.  Contests over histories articulated with such sites reflect the recognition and obfuscation of such conflict in daily lived experience.  Where these historic relations of power disparity have resulted in the absence of remains and material evidence, what then?  Grounded in ethnographic work in the United States and Brazil, this paper interrogates the intangible processes of memory and memorialization at the bounds of positivist privileging of materiality.","3105","Symposium","Presenter","Autumn_Barrett",3105,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Th-evening"

Few studies have attempted to connect aboriginal ceramics research with contemporary Native peoples, either through past-to-present identity connections or through Indigenous community engagement. Additionally, there have been few efforts to integrate research across New England’s contemporary geopolitical boundaries. Recognizing these deficiencies in regional scholarship, this paper discusses two ceramics studies from New England—each exploring concepts of identity. One study centers on potters living in the Penobscot River Valley in Maine during the Ceramic Period (3050-450 B.P.), and the other focuses on the Late Woodland period (1300-1600 AD) through 17th century potters in the Connecticut River Valley in Massachusetts. Each study applied Indigenous archaeologies and technological choice strategies to an archaeological problem. However, the motivations behind the studies and the social contexts of the researchers influenced the research process and interpretations. This paper reviews these studies and the challenge of using ceramics as a central element in constructing or assigning identity while contemplating the range of factors that influence how researchers make connections between past and present peoples in the geopolitical landscape of New England.

This works distinctly on the assumption that these identities and their linked ceramic traditions are stable and unchanging; ceramics that do not fit into the expected pattern are often explained away as trade items or the arrival of new ethnic groups. This paper instead argues that ceramics reflect the sequence of ceramic manufacture generated by individual potters whose behaviors reinforce a community of practice, open to change over time through innovation and interaction. A series of detailed ceramic analysis methods were developed to interpret data from four related 17th and 18th century sites, tracking the diaspora and culture change of the Apalachee, a Native American group originally from Northern Florida. In the case of examining the ceramics of post-diaspora Apalachee, these assemblages allow an in-depth study of ceramic practice with the unique advantage of also having substantial historic documents identifying the potters’ ethnic identity. With this knowledge, this paper attempts to divorce the unchallenged connection between ceramics and ethnicity and instead encourage interpreting ceramics as a vehicle for culture change.","3105","Symposium","Presenter","Michelle_Pigott",3105,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Th-evening"

The gap falls during the middle Holocene c. 6000-4000 BP when few sites have dated deposits. Yet from evidence dating before and after those millennia, important changes must have occurred, including changes in settlement systems, lithics and ceramic technologies, the appearance of cereal agriculture, and new burial practices. Recent palaeoclimate research under the auspices of the Middle Mekong Archaeological Project in northern Laos is providing possible clues related to the gap in archaeological evidence. Four new speleothem records document an abrupt trend of weakened monsoons beginning at approximately 5-4.5- ka initiating the onset of a mega-drought that peaked at approximately. 4.0 ka.

From the 1960s to the 1990s, a series of archaeologists investigated the relationship between kurgan builders and Baden in the Carpathian Basin at various geographic scales.

The ceramic deposition practices of Trinchereños (Trincheras Tradition peoples) reveal the life history of the pots themselves.

Papers presenting methodology and results for underwater landscape surveys, site testing and exploration, and underwater excavation demonstrate the growing importance of this area of research.

I will detail the paraphernalia used by usékares and sukias as it becomes important to understand the nature, presence and movement of distinct objects. I will also discuss how, on the area,  ethnohistorical, ethnographical, linguistic and mythological data are able to depict clues to the presence or absence of material culture.  The Museo Nacional de Costa Rica holds materials coming from that precise area, with no context.

Nevertheless, archaeological exploration of the area to date has successfully contextualized the nature and transitions of non-perishable material culture. However, organic remains rarely survive in funerary contexts due to the high acidity of the soil, high humidity, and high precipitation in this region. Human remains almost never remain in the stone-lined tombs of Greater Chiriquí, in which one or more occupants were buried (as evidenced by the number and placement of mortuary offerings). But in shell-bearing middens along the coast, the increased soil pH from high calcium carbonate contents allows better preservation of human and animal bone. These differences in preservation have led to a sharp division in the variety and quality of mortuary information derived from coastal (lowland) and inland (highland) sites. The present study traces the few examples of human remains recovered from archaeological sites in the region and what they tell us about the cultural activities and health of pre-Columbian populations.

Recent investigations at El Tintal have shed light on its Preclassic settlement, organized around what we propose was an ancient lagoon which settlers connected to the larger regional fluvial network by the construction of a 2.4 km-long artificial canal. Preliminary investigations show that this canal, although mostly constructed following a traditional open-channel design, appears to have had two sections flowing underground, with tunnel sections carved into the underlying bedrock, providing the first evidence of complex hydraulic engineering at such an early stage. El Tintal maintained a complex interregional network relying on both foot travel over causeways and trails, as well as canoe transportation across what is increasingly looking like a significantly more humid regional landscape.

Politicians, from the left and right, bemoan what they term “crumbling infrastructure,” offering fixes by way of material and technological improvements to roads, waterways, cities, and energy grids.  Scholars draw on and expand posthumanist theories to analyze and expose how infrastructure does not just passively support social aims, but actively shapes (and subverts) human intentions. These discussions sharpen focus on the material characteristics and necessities of infrastructure, but frequently neglect to equally take into account the ideological mechanisms—processes of labor coordination, perceptions of progress, or projects for sustainable ecology—that are essential to and inseparable from infrastructure.  With this paper, I ask how archaeologists, with their unique ability to record and interpret long-term socio-material processes, might add to such discussions of infrastructure. I argue that “crumbling infrastructure” is a misnomer because it defines infrastructure as fixed materials rather than fluid entities that are parts of broader assemblages comprising things, people, and ideas. I present data from Cusco, Peru during early Spanish colonization to examine the interwoven ideologies and materials that can bring infrastructure into being, and relegate it to ruin.

","Historic","Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology","Settlement Patterns","The Spanish conquest of the Philippines redesigned the indigenous landscape to adhere to the idealized orthogonal plan outlined by King Philip II’s Ordinances of 1573, centered on the church plaza. This reconfiguration facilitated the successful political, economic, and religious control of the colonial possession. An aspect of this resettlement plan is the concept of Bajo de Campana (under the bell) that implied control through the ringing of the church bell. The plaza complex, which is exemplified by the policy of reducción, projects a Spanish ideal Catholic Society, whereby the configuration of the physical landscape was ordered. Reducción aimed to consolidate colonial control over Philippine indigenous communities by compelling prominent individuals to relocate into poblaciones within hearing distance of church-bells. Bell ringing ordered daily life by signaling times to congregate and by marking special occasions. The audibility of church-bells also marked the extent of the Crown’s territorial holdings. To understand the processes associated with this colonial accommodation, we explore the social, religious, and environmental ramifications of Spanish settlement-building programs in the Philippines by examining spatial, acoustic, ethnohistoric, and archaeological data from plaza complexes located at two Spanish-era church sites: Quipayo and St. Francis of Assisi (both established in 1578).","3086","Symposium","Presenter","Jared_Koller",3086,0,7,"7","1.75",NA,"Symposium",1.75,"Th-evening"

This paper specifically examines how this cosmology understands the materiality of infrastructures, the built substrate upon which networks of human and non-human worlds intersect and collide. I argue that this cosmology contrasts infrastructures of the recent past as dangerous and polluting against infrastructures of the distant past as sacred and pure. This paper approaches this matter via the analysis of archaeological, historical, and ethnographic data over the past 1000 years in the Basin of Mexico. This case is particularly relevant because this region’s landscapes, places, and people both have defied and haven fallen within the limits of the Anthropocene cosmology. The development in infrastructures tied to varying institutional systems has always had to encounter—physically, socially, and culturally—the materiality of precedent, a trajectory that shows the Anthropocene is not simply geological or cultural but also is political.  The need to project a cosmology of sustainability onto the present and into the future depends upon how the Anthropocene’s ideal and contrasting categories are strategically deployed.","3086","Symposium","Presenter","Christopher_Morehart",3086,0,7,"7","1.75",NA,"Symposium",1.75,"Th-evening"

Recent studies have sought to alter this impression as part of larger trends that seek to ground our understanding of pre-modern pastoralists in concrete faunal, botanical, isotopic, landscape, and historical data, which clearly show the effect that pastoral practices and infrastructure have had on cultural landscapes through time. I draw on ethnographic and archaeological case studies from the Middle East to discuss some general political, social, and environmental issues affecting the elaboration of pastoralist infrastructure in seasonal territories and the complex relationships transhumant people have with the infrastructure of surrounding sedentary communities. Drawing on archaeological survey data, I also discuss water and pasture infrastructure of the last 500 years in southeastern Turkey and the changing political environment in which this infrastructure was used by mobile pastoralists to live in a “marginal” area under the Ottoman and modern Turkish states.

However, emerging transdisciplinary conversations on infrastructures are challenging social scientists and historians to rethink conventional, functional interpretations of infrastructures, and instead to assess their materiality in social and historical ways that go beyond simply fulfilling societal needs. Infrastructures are increasingly seen as unruly or fragile historical assemblages that can transcend or disrupt the historical conditions of their production. In this symposium, we ask contributors to pull on their expertise and case studies in studying the built environment, technologies, and landscapes to respond to one central question about infrastructures: how do physical and social dimensions of infrastructures relate across time and space? We urge contributors to address this problem through specific archaeological case studies and by considering issues that might be subsumed within them. These include (1) infrastructures that facilitate some political projects, prevent others, and outlive still others; (2) infrastructures that are invisible and taken for granted or provide the material for spectacle, conflict, or violence, and (3) the multiple intended and unintended dimensions and consequences that stem from the coupling of social and physical infrastructures.","3086","Symposium","Chair (Primary)","Christopher_Morehart",3086,0,7,"7","1.75",NA,"Symposium",1.75,"Th-evening"

On the one hand, rituals honoring the dead located in caves and smaller mausoleums grounded people in place and participated in the construction of group identity. I suggest that the deceased in this funerary program became ancestral spirits and were likely commemorated as an anonymous collectivity. On the other, rituals celebrating the deceased placed in tall multi-story buildings distributed at the top of hillside embodied political competition among kin groups and were ultimately used to legitimize power.

As a result, it has been subject to multiple waves of colonization over the past two millennia, from Classic period Tikal and Calakmul to contemporary narcotraffickers and transnational corporations.
 In this paper, I will summarize the ebb and flow of foreign powers and local autonomy in the region as seen through the caves, mountains, and archaeological sites that are a fundamental source of local identity and play an active role in the lives of the Maya who live around them in the past and present.  As a result, they serve as microcosms of the entire region, and by understanding the history of conquest and independence of the sacred landscape one can understand the history of the region itself.

The research revealed rock art played a prominent role in expressing changing social relations in the region. This paper focuses on the rockshelter, Gonga, and its rock art panel that was created and repainted multiple times over the millennia. An early painting depicts a human couple, while later repaintings emphasized the female character and the male figure was smeared with paint. I propose that the initial painting served to instantiate the people represented by the figures as founding ancestors of an ayllu (kinship group) based on the timing of the painting in conjunction with the appearance of public burial structures called chullpas. The highlighting of the female character at the expense of the male indicates a negotiation or contestation of prevailing social relations.

In turn, the interpretation of such data often takes a back seat and little is ultimately added to the anthropological understanding of a site.

With a rather arid climate, much of Botswana’s ground surface (and archaeology) is easily visible to airborne and spaceborne sensors.  Without sufficient training data for supervised classification, an iterative spectral clustering method was used to group spectrally similar pixels from multispectral imagery into a large number of spectrally distinct but unknown classes. By visually assessing and removing classes that do not correlate with known sites in the region, the remaining classes provide a map for prospective site locations. This work illustrates how satellite imagery and digital remote sensing methods enable the inspection of large areas with little processing time, something that would be impossible from the ground in a single field-season. Also illustrated by this work is the need for on-the-ground inspection of the prospective sites to confirm their existence and to improve the model.","3080","Symposium","Presenter","Forrest_Follett",3080,1,9,"10","2.5",NA,"Symposium",2.5,"Th-evening"

We see, for example, that some creations in Europe’s cuisine are entirely composed of what some might call weedy species.  Consider the ingredients of cordials across Europe, drinks that can include up to 15 ‘wild’ taxa. These plants were collected, nurtured and cultivated in and around kitchen gardens and houses.  For example, the current Italian kitchen garden weed Portulaca was not only eaten in salads in the past and into the present in some rural locations, but it also interestingly has helpful blood pressure lowering capacities, further suggesting that local weeds that grew next to people’s houses and in their nearby kitchen gardens were potentially essential to cuisines, flavors, as well as the health of the inhabitants.

The present landscape is the result of generations of management of plants, as gardens, fields, stands, or trees – which are, importantly, individuated and associated with specific community members or families. These features regulate and communicate access to the spaces and fruits, literal and metaphorical, of trabalho de campo.  Simultaneously, they materialize social relations, history, memory, and genealogy.","3079","Symposium","Presenter","Anna_Browne Ribeiro",3079,0,12,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-evening"

At Naachtun (Northern Peten, Guatemala), we studied charcoal remains from archaeological contexts in relation with pedological data to reconstruct forest resources and land management through time. Since the beginning of Naachtun's occupation at the end of the Preclassic period (˜ AD 150), domestic firewood economy seems to have been closely linked to the local agrarian system. Wood was collected in semi-opened woodlands, suggesting a reliance on both fallow lands and preserved forests probably close to human settlements. In that context, the observation of an important shift in firewood collection strategies during the second half of the Late Classic period (AD 750-830), from opportunistic gathering of a wide range of forest species to a heavier reliance on fruit tree species, allows us to draw hypotheses on the intensification of arboriculture practices and the progressive transformation of woodlands around the site. As this shift occurred rapidly while the city experienced its demographic peak, it could express an adaptation strategy throughout Naachtun society, utilizing forest garden plots for its firewood supply as a result of higher pressure on local resources.","3079","Symposium","Presenter","Lydie_Dussol",3079,0,12,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-evening"

An understanding of the geological definition and geochemistry of toolstone can allow archaeologist to ask more specific questions about toolstone provenance, procurement, and use.  The toolstone variability among sites in the Tangle Lakes Region is not well understood, and is thought to belong to two local quarries. This project seeks to understand the geochemical composition of two cryptocrystalline silicate toolstone quarries and visually similar artifacts from specific activity areas from three sites in the region at varying distances from the quarries. The toolstone variability will be defined by geochemical groupings using XRF and pXRF analysis. Future analysis will attempt to geochemically match the artifacts with the two quarries, and learn if there is more variation in the material than can be accounted for by the two quarries.

Technological and iconographic linkages were frequently cited, but rarely were the mechanisms of the proposed linkages adequately defined or demonstrated archaeologically. In 2008, perhaps unduly influenced by having moved to California in 2004, I floated the concept of a “southern Mesoamerican Wedge” a la Kroeber. This wedge paralleled the Pacific coast and while the Paleo and Archaic periods were almost invisible, by the early Preclassic almost identical ceramics are found in the Soconusco, beneath downtown Managua, and in the Arenal region of Costa Rica.

The archaeological signatures for these two dynamical processes—Brownian motion versus Lévy flights—are potentially quite different, making them useful and practical to consider.

Yet these texts simultaneously indicate that other groups living in isolated communities or urban barrios were also commonplace and included Maribios, Mazatec, Chondal, Matagalpans, Sumo-Ulwa, and possibly Lenca and/or Maya-speaking peoples, among others. As archaeologists, we are aware—many of us dutifully placing the convoluted language distribution map in our culture history write-ups. Despite this, most of these groups are not factored into theoretical discussions and are rarely, if ever, seriously discussed as part of the region’s archaeological past. Instead, a three-phase linear trajectory (Chibchan-Chorotega-Nicarao) premised on ‘great’ migration events ending in regional domination by foreigners and their intrusive material monoculture has been the interpretive norm. This inconsistency begs the questions: Do we really believe complex multicultural lifeways magically appeared with or immediately before the Spaniards? And if multicultural lifeways were a pre-Columbian norm in this area, as complex social organization at contact suggests, why can’t we see those other groups in the record?

CEP is derived and builds upon theories of ‘communities of practice’ and is identifiable in the archaeological record as intentional modifications to both space and sound-related artefacts. CEP is especially pertinent to the discussion of multicultural social organization, because it denotes group identity based on consistencies within practices rather than by ethnic origin. For example, variation in instrument design, playing of a musical instrument (gestures, finger positions, etc.), or in soundscapes might suggest the presence of several distinct communities of engaged musical performance.

","Intermediate Area","Ceramic Analysis","Communities of Practice","Despite being the largest country in Central America, Nicaragua’s archaeological record remains the least explored and most ignored. One consequence of this is that reconstructions of Nicaragua’s prehistory have tended to rely overmuch on rather sparse (and not necessarily reliable) ethnohistoric accounts in which migration from Mesoamerican homelands is heavily emphasized, generally to the detriment of other kinds of cultural phenomena, including indigenous developments that are not explicitly “Mesoamerican”. Meanwhile, only sporadic attention has been paid to the archaeological record itself, and the potential evidence that it provides for (a) actual migration and/or conquest, (b) interaction and mobility between groups within Nicaragua and beyond, and (c) multiculturalism across Greater Nicoya. This paper argues that understanding of Greater Nicoya’s multicultural prehistory would benefit from approaches in which archaeological interpretations are informed but not dominated by ethnohistoric evidence—approaches that not only treat migration as a cultural phenomenon that must be demonstrated in the record rather than taken for granted but which also are capable of recognizing archaeological evidence of potential interaction between diverse groups.","3070","Symposium","Presenter","Larry_Steinbrenner",3070,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-evening"

While technological and iconographic linkages are frequently raised as evidence for these events, very rarely are their mechanisms adequately defined or demonstrated archaeologically. Describing these changes, particularly involving groups of differing linguistic and/or ethnic backgrounds, traditional linear narratives tend to focus on episodic cultural succession—the replacement of a passive (generally ‘indigenous’) group by a well-defined donor group or worldview—when some critical tipping point is met. In the material culture of Central America, this tipping point is frequently identified by shifts in choice of raw material, technology, symbolic content, function, and/or decorative style.  

This symposium aims to transcend over-simplified notions of human mobility and social organization. In many regions, ethnohistoric and colonial records indicate that major centers frequently contained differing linguistic or ethnic groups at European contact.  We welcome all papers that explore human mobility from multiscalar, nonlinear perspectives, and/or the potential implications of multicultural lifeways for archaeological reconstructions. How might we better access and demonstrate mobility and multicultural social organization in the record?

We have been very fortunate this year to have Dr. Fred Valdez, Luisa Aebersold and their team graciously contribute to our research program in ceramic technology. They took time during their extremely busy field season to bring clay for our team to prepare and attempt to build pottery at Programme for Belize Archaeological Field School.
We have two different types of clay to research. The first clay is yellow clay CH4444. The second clay is iron-rich, red clay CH2222. 
Our first task was to visually analyze the artifacts from the two different lots. Ch4444 was associated with archaic tools. CH2222 was associated with Preclassic pottery. 
We designed four different techniques to prepare the clays for our study. Our first group of CH2222 was aged directly in water and hand sieved. Both clays were moist from retrieval. This became problematic for the iron- rich clays. The clays were extremely difficult to break down. We dried them in open baskets.
 The remaining CH2222 and CH4444 were prepared by hand. Due to the weather and the iron bearings clays these processes took several days to accomplish.

However, to date these have not been well-incorporated into federal efforts to address climate change, largely as a result of a lack of systematic engagement. To address this gap for archaeology and other social sciences, in 2016 the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) undertook an effort to engage four underrepresented social science disciplines to support preparation of the fourth US National Climate Assessment and other ongoing federal work. This paper presents the experiences of three archaeologists and one anthropologist involved in this project and an assessment of what worked, what was a challenge, and recommendations for improving the art of connecting study of the past to actionable government results for global climate change.

This paper will argue that knowing the nature of our engagements requires a deep ethnographic reading of the contexts of our research and the multiple roles it plays in the communities we engaged in our research. This approach draws from the transcendental empiricism described by Deleuze, such that what we do in becoming engaged, even in the most routine way, requires consistent analysis of how those we engage with come into view and why they become open to collaboration. Such an analysis is the basis of ethnographic archaeology, or the effort to understand how archaeology is and can be an agent in the communities we work with.

Entire narratives have been created and imposed on the landscape around Kinte’s home village of Juffure, and remnants of British rule in the capital were systematically removed.

Two aspects of Classical archaeology’s disciplinary history are particularly important for understanding the relationship between Greek archaeology (as practiced by American archaeologists) and modern Greece: first, Greek archaeology’s early and close relationship with the ideology of Hellenism and, second, the ways in which archaeological work in Greece has intersected (or not) with ethnographic studies of Greek communities. I then explore some of the current institutional factors (many of them legacies of the discipline’s trajectory) that either inhibit or fail to actively encourage collaborative archaeological practice in Greece. For archaeological projects supported by U.S. academic institutions, these include the academic position of Greek archaeology within Classics departments and the dismissal of Modern Greek as a legitimate field of study for Classical archaeologists. Finally, I suggest potential future directions for engaged archaeologies of Greece that directly confront this disciplinary legacy. How can Classical archaeologists both avoid uncritically promoting narratives of Classical Greece as the “birthplace of Western civilization” and actively advocate for collaborative practices within an academic power structure that is often unsympathetic to these concerns?","3064","Symposium","Presenter","Grace_Erny",3064,0,10,"10","2.5",NA,"Symposium",2.5,"Th-evening"

This is frequently understood to mean local communities and nearby residents, but projects can live or die according to the will of groups less often discussed as part of the target public: authority structures such as permitting agencies or even national governments. How do such organizations figure into the “public” of public scholarship? What happens when research is pressured to produce the narratives that authority structures desire? Is it possible to practice engaged and ethical research in these contexts, and if so, what practical accommodations can we reach—or must we abandon the project altogether?
 
This paper investigates these questions in the context of post-genocide Rwanda, where social science research has become increasingly constrained. Some researchers have found themselves on semi-official “enemies lists”, while others encounter pressure to be “friends of Rwanda” who can be counted on to produce complimentary accounts of the country.

2012), this paper demonstrates how decolonization is not just an
historical process but rather an action that is political at its core. As
global efforts to redefine archaeological practice are underway to ensure
a more just and equitable practice, political historiographies of colonial
archaeology in high income postcolonies, such as the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), must also be investigated. Epistemic violence embedded within
colonial archaeology maintains itself under the guise of ‘science,’ as
archaeology continues to make demands upon bodies, landscapes, memories,
histories, and heritage.

This paper investigates what refusing to work in inequitable conditions
might look like and what sorts of alternative pathways exist for an
equitable and decolonized archaeological praxis. This will include
entering archaeology (as a discipline) into transdisciplinary dialog with
contemporary art and design. Engagement is not limited to a human to human
interaction but rather, this paper will consider conceptual engagement as
a key facet to epistemic rearrangements. Utilizing over five years of work

An archaeologist’s commitment to engaged, ethical archaeology may prepare them to grapple with manifestations of colonialism and privilege, but what happens when that very ethics requires them to push back against the groups they hope to engage?

The study of human mobility is key to understanding the social and cultural dynamics of the pre-Columbian groups that inhabited northern Chile’s Atacama Desert. Material culture suggests that during the Late Intermediate Period (AD 900-1450) individuals frequently crossed the desert from the coast to the Andes and vice versa. Fish remains have been found in the interior valleys, and inland textiles and crops at the coast. This paper explores mobility in northern Chile through the application of strontium and oxygen isotope analyses on human teeth from several archaeological sites. First we present a local bioavailable strontium baseline for the study area, based on plant and animal remains, which helps to alleviate the scarcity of bio-available strontium isotope data for northern Chile. Results show that non-local individuals of both sexes were buried in the dispersed cemeteries of Pica 8, Quitor 6 and Los Verdes 1. These results support the idea that varied groups of individuals moved across the landscape, complementing and augmenting the larger discussion on mobility patterns in the Atacama Desert.

This review highlights the potential impact of developing techniques to source Spondylus shells from their coastal Ecuadorian and Peruvian breeding grounds on the study of the ancient Andes.

Sea level rise due to global climate change, however, is causing shoreline erosion damaging or potentially destroying these locations. Important information of past cultures is being lost before study can begin. This is why the Trust, which owns and manages these islands, supports archaeological research.

How we imagine ‘Silk Road’ landscape is therefore rooted in assumptions about categories and conditions of agency (social and historical), and about space. These include mobility, transcendence, and visibility—both in the landscape and in the record. Travel and cosmopolitan encounters along roads (Silk or otherwise) are chrono-topoi (spacetimes) which structure our historically-situated regard of spaces, such as mountain valleys and expansive deserts. 
Working in local landscapes of medieval Armenia, I problematize the idea of Silk Road space, thinking not only about mobility and contact, but also about spaces of care, hospitality, and comfort. Critical to the theme of this session, these spaces and practices are gendered, embodied, they depend on vulnerable spacetimes and ‘quotidian’ actors, as well as particular ideas of ‘culture’ and ‘nature.’ In this paper I will explore how picking at the gendered structuring of Silk Road narratives both requires that we deploy archaeological data in different ways, and also leads to larger-scale untanglings of understandings about large-scale exchange, culture ‘contact’ and the distinctions between pre-modern and modern worlds.

This has been true since the origins of burial practices in the human lineage, dating to at least the early Upper Paleolithic, and perhaps earlier. This paper is a preliminary attempt to look back at the European Upper Paleolithic burial record to examine these burials as queer spaces, and as a place for queer identity construction, reconstruction, and negotiation. The Upper Paleolithic has a severely limited number of burials, and thus these burial places – both cave or rockshelter and open-air contexts - and the individuals contained within them, can be considered queer, different, and non-normative. The queer nature of the embodied identities of these burials and their location has been hereto unexplored. Through an analysis of the intersection of bodies, grave goods, landscapes, and queer theory, the fluidity and contextuality of Upper Paleolithic gendered and sexual spaces and identities will emerge.","3058","Symposium","Presenter","Nathan_Klembara",3058,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-evening"

These settlements were intimately associated with rundale farming, a system of cooperative or collective agriculture. This system was a sophisticated response to specific ecological conditions. Lands within infields, outfields, and commonage were allocated so that each household received a proportionate share of productive and non-productive land. Thus, each community was highly adapted to its unique environmental niche. These settlements were also highly complex social organisms. Children kept cattle away from the gardens, cut and planted potatoes, and gleaned fields where grains were harvested. Women provided for the children, carded and spun wool, and tended to the household. Men were responsible for the management of farm lands. Thus, activity within each clachan and rundale was shaped by gender and age. Although maligned as ‘backwards’ and ‘primitive,’ clachans were in fact well-orchestrated socio-economic systems that distributed the risk of agricultural production among its members.

However, through a careful analysis of the early landscape of practice of the hominy foodway of the Black Warrior Valley, I suggest that during this early period, it was not the activities of men, but instead those of new and endemic women to the area that first sparked and then united the early Moundville landscape. This analysis further suggests that what has largely been interpreted as a homogenous cultural expression for all people regardless of gender within the area was instead more heavily driven by, and had a greater impact on, female gendered activities.

Rock art images and panels were treated as static representations of symbolic frameworks while their materiality and active role in cultural production were overlooked.

Furthermore, rock art panels may accrue complex biographies via multiple engagements.
I combine a relational-biographical approach with digital imaging technologies (e.g. RTI) to the study of rock art carvings as a way forward to address these questions.

We analyse prehistoric Marshallese foraging patterns using the first high-resolution study of the archaeomalacological record of Ebon Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands, eastern Micronesia.

However, these environments are also delicate ecosystems that are susceptible to damage or alteration from a myriad of external forces.

The influence of environmental and anthropogenic forces on island and coastal settings has long been a topic of interest in archaeology.  Shifts in environmental conditions, and intensive exploitation of nearshore habitats by humans can have a dramatic and damaging impact on ecosystems. Conversely, shifts in environmental conditions can lead to the proliferation of natural resources, and the repeated, long-term use of these habitats by groups can result in unique management systems which carefully maintains an ecosystem.  Finally, researchers must also consider the ecological limitations of the taxa in their assemblages, as these variables can also have a significant impact on the way an ecosystem adapts to external pressures.It is therefore clear that to properly understand the use and evolution of island and coastal settings, researchers must take a holistic approach which integrates all these variables into their interpretations.

Archaeologists have often explained human responses to these increasingly aquatic environment as in terms of an increasing reliance on fisher-hunter-gatherer economies. Similarly, once the AHP ended, humans abandoned these lifeways. These perspectives are overly deterministic; in this paper, we approach this problem by adapting a Resilience Theory framework to examine a (type site?) case-site on the Lothagam-Lokam site near Lake Turkana, Kenya. New excavations at Lothagam-Lokam have uncovered a sequence of small-scale local environmental shifts with interstratified cultural horizons that spans the entire Holocene. We argue that people’s decisions to intensify or re-organize their economic strategies shaped their options and cultural attitudes in responding to subsequent stresses when faced with small-scale environmental fluctuations around Turkana. The interconnected cultural and economic systems gradually assembled through multiple resilience cycles ultimately conditioned responses to more extreme events such as the 60 m drop in Turkana’s lake level at the end of the AHP. Our application of Resilience Theory at Lokam provides a potential path forward for more nuanced discussions of human-environment interactions during the AHP.","3055","Symposium","Presenter","Steven_Goldstein",3055,0,9,"9","2.25",NA,"Symposium",2.25,"Th-evening"

Increasing aridity ca. 6,000-5,000 BP encouraged early herders to migrate south into the region, while local hunter-gatherers intensified their reliance on ecologically-rich environments. Kansyore hunter-gatherers of the Lake Victoria basin established specialized subsistence systems that incorporated heavy pottery-use and seasonal site occupation at this time, possibly in response to decreasing rainfall. A gap in the archaeological record, however, limits understandings of Kansyore strategies in relation to environmental reorganization. Evidence from western Kenya suggests Early (~8,000-6,000 BP) and Late phase occupations (~3,500-1,500 BP) associated with changes in the frequency of pottery production/use, ceramic style, and fishing strategies, yet no evidence exists for Kansyore activities between these periods. Recent excavations at Namundiri A in eastern Uganda reveal a long archaeological sequence without breaks in the stratigraphic or material record. Faunal and ceramic data shows clear patterns of subsistence change similar to those observed between the Early and Late Kansyore, suggesting that this Kansyore “gap” is the result of incomplete radiometric data and a dearth of targeted research in the region, rather than a break in occupation during the mid-Holocene.","3055","Symposium","Presenter","Mica_Jones",3055,0,9,"9","2.25",NA,"Symposium",2.25,"Th-evening"

In eastern Africa, lake levels were very much higher than present, with now-closed lakes overflowing into the Nile and tributary rivers. While it is widely recognised that this African Humid Period resulted from an intensified African summer monsoon linked to the early Holocene precessional increase in summer insolation, its precise timing and geographical extent, especially its onset and termination, are widely debated. Vegetation feedback factors may account for differences in the rate of changes between  insolation drivers and climatic response. Local factors, especially lake hydrology and morphology, undoubtedly account for differences in the timing of changes between sites. In this contribution, I will review some of the evidence for the African Humid Period, demonstrate these apparent anomalies, and attempt to clarify its temporal and geographical boundaries.","3055","Symposium","Presenter","Henry_Lamb",3055,0,9,"9","2.25",NA,"Symposium",2.25,"Th-evening"

","Paleolithic","Survey","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers","Recent paleoclimate studies indicate rainfall increased dramatically over many parts of northeastern and eastern Africa at the end of MIS 2 and the hyper-arid LGM ~14.7 ka, thereby marking the beginning of MIS 1 and the “African Humid Period” (AHP). These studies also suggest that not only should the “early” AHP be decoupled from the start of the Holocene some 3000 years later, it should also encompass the cooler, more arid Younger Dryas (12.9-11.7 ka). This paper explores two key questions: 1) can we identify archaeological evidence for hunter-gatherer activities in this region during the early AHP ~15-12 ka; and 2) if so are there technological, settlement, dietary and other behavioral changes that can be linked to climatic change or other possible causal mechanisms? A preliminary review of the early AHP archaeological record shows that despite a small data set and a limited number of chronometric ages, there appears to be few sites in the Nile Valley, while in eastern Africa there are substantially more. We conclude by discussing how a richer understanding of the early AHP archaeological record might better prepare and inform us of the significant human responses to the later part of the AHP ~12-5.5 ka.","3055","Symposium","Presenter","Steven_Brandt",3055,0,9,"9","2.25",NA,"Symposium",2.25,"Th-evening"

","Other","Bioarchaeology/Skeletal Analysis","Environment and Climate ","The early Holocene African humid period (AHP, ~12,000-6000 bp) was followed by the Middle Holocene dry phase (MHDP, ~6000-3500 BP), and the modern climatic regime was established during the later Holocene (~3500 bp to present). The relationship of environmental change to human social and territorial organization adaptations are fairly well-documented in northern, eastern and southern Africa. However, the Holocene terrestrial record of environmental change in east-central Africa is poorly documented. Stable carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotope analyses of human bones and teeth from northern Malawi suggest that hunter-gatherers exploited humid closed woodlands during the AHP (low 13C, low 15N), drier more open habitats during the MHDP (higher 13C, very high 15N), and relatively closed, humid woodlands during the later Holocene (low 13C, low 15N). Iron Age peoples consumed substantial amounts C4 plants (high 13C, low 15N). Strontium isotope data for small subset of these skeletons are insufficient to reconstruct residential life histories. With a more detailed terrestrial environmental history, more human Sr isotope data and a strontium isoscape, it may be possible to test ecological models of hunter-gatherer social and territorial organization in changing Holocene environments in Malawi.

Stable isotope analysis (SIA, specifically d13C) can measure diets directly, yet few studies have conducted SIA on human remains from this region. We present 25 new d13C values from human tooth enamel recovered from archaeological sites around Lake Turkana (northwest Kenya) and on Lukenya Hill and Rigo Cave (southern Kenya), whose material culture suggests economic strategies ranging from fishing-hunting-gathering (FHG) to herding. These data show pronounced regional dietary variability even after herding took hold. All samples from the Turkana Basin, including both FGH (GeJi11) and herding (GaJi4, GeJi9, GbJj1) sites, range from -4 to -8‰, indicating strong intake of either C3 plants or animals that consumed them. In contrast, samples from southern Kenyan herding sites of Lukenya Hill (GvJm202) and Rigo Cave (GrJh3) range from -2 to -4‰, suggesting more input from C4 grasses or herbivores feeding upon them. Overall, individuals from northern Kenya sites exhibit greater dietary variability than those from the south. Results suggest that post-AHP environments differed substantially within the eastern African Rift, fostering localized economic strategies by early herders.","3055","Symposium","Presenter","Kendra_Chritz",3055,0,9,"9","2.25",NA,"Symposium",2.25,"Th-evening"

While geological and climatological approaches reconstruct the physical impacts of climate changes, archaeology is uniquely capable of evaluating their relations to social change. Africa’s Holocene archaeological record offers an important perspective on human responses to some of the most extreme climatic fluctuations of the last 12000 years, beginning with the onset of the African Humid Period when lakes and rivers covered the Sahara, through the rapid return to aridity across many parts of Africa ~5500 BP. These shifts presented sequences of challenges to the diverse hunter-gatherers, farmers, and herders that coexisted across much of Africa. This session examines the ways in which societies across Africa responded to local environmental manifestations of larger Holocene climate changes, and the long-term legacies of both successful and unsuccessful responses. Papers will present new data-points and advances in relevant methods. We especially hope to develop theoretical approaches for studying the archaeology of climate change in the uniquely diverse social and economic contexts of Holocene Africa.

While Middle Woodland (Hopewell) and late Late Woodland mounded tumuli are well represented in the archaeological record, not so for cemeteries from the several intervening centuries. Relying on data from the archaeological record, primarily radiocarbon dates, variation in cemetery structure, mound location, and material culture, we address this issue. Possible explanations range from the simple, depopulation and regional cultural discontinuity, to nuanced, complex interpretations of funerary activities and interment facilities from throughout the Middle and Late Woodland periods. Our perspectives are also enhanced through the judicious use of ethnographic and ethnohistoric sources.

Lynne’s map made two things startlingly clear. First, decades of excavations were not all referenced to a common datum and few had left visible surface indications, making it difficult to relocate earlier excavations and avoid re-excavating disturbed contexts. Second, just 10% of the core residential area has been excavated and far less than 10% of the entire site has been studied. To gain large-scale spatial control over ancient and modern subsurface disturbances across the site, the authors undertook a comprehensive magnetic gradient survey of the entire palisaded portion of the site. Data were collected using a Foerster Ferex 4.032 4-probe fluxgate gradiometer array mounted on a handcart. Data collection and processing was conducted by Ohio Valley Archaeology, Inc. Results of the survey are leading to a more comprehensive understanding of site organization and refined knowledge of the locations of excavations and other modern ground disturbance activities.

The approach relied on the equal weighting and assessment of three lines of evidence: contextual (i.e., archaeological evidence for mortuary treatment and social identity), osteological (i.e., the physical characteristics of the skeleton), and historical evidence (i.e., research into how the cemetery was used and the cultural traditions and identities of the people buried there). For each individual, the three lines of evidence were carefully reviewed and compared and a likelihood statement based on the distribution of all three lines of evidence was made (highly likely, multiple affinities, or culturally indeterminate). This model approach led to the identification of cultural affinity for nearly fifty percent of the 1,202 individuals recovered from the Alameda-Stone cemetery and successfully met the requirements of the stakeholder groups that claimed remains from the cemetery and Pima County, the project sponsor.","3048","Symposium","Presenter","Joseph_Hefner",3048,0,14,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-evening"

","Paleolithic","Lithic Analysis","Landscape Archaeology","Abundant surface scatters of Middle Stone Age artifacts are found throughout northern Malawi, eroding from remnant alluvial fan deposits (Chitimwe Beds). Surface surveys documenting these areas have guided the emplacement of 50+ archaeological test pits and excavations, many of which have yielded in situ MSA sites.  However, the surficial evidence itself has been subject to less discussion and merits closer attention. At the Bruce site, surface artifacts were identified as part of an assemblage originally excavated in 1965, but which has since undergone significant disturbance from local development. Recent excavation and surface collecting by archaeologists has had an additional impact on the site. Bruce contrasts with localities like the similarly aged White Whale, ~40km to the south, where surface finds evidence a well-preserved knapping surface exposed by erosion near a cliff edge, that nevertheless retains spatial integrity. We use these case studies to discuss assumptions associated with surface finds, the role and influence of archaeological research on the integrity of surface and subsurface assemblages, and the relative stability of archaeological landscapes. Finally, we examine the potential for assessing landscapes modified by agrarianism—which may obscure or erase surficial archaeological materials—using declassified CORONA satellite imagery collected from 1959 to 1972.","3047","Symposium","Presenter","Sheila_Nightingale",3047,1,9,"10","2.5",NA,"Symposium",2.5,"Th-evening"

However, due to the difficulties in numerically dating them, they are usually considered as coarse indicators of past behaviors. Here, we explore the use of lithic weathering to develop local relative chronologies, and to better incorporate these assemblages into archaeological research. We test whether the most weathered artifacts should be considered the oldest; an assumption that has informally served to compare assemblages. Through macroscopic analyses, we compared seven surficial mid-to-late Holocene lithic assemblages from different micro-environments of the Atacama Desert, northern Chile. By recording changes in polish, texture, shine and color, we established that weathering varied significantly between two main locations: interfluve and canyon sites. Lithics from interfluve sites showed a dark coating and were moderately to highly weathered, whereas canyon lithics were mildly weathered and uncoated. This means that even within the hyperarid core of the Atacama, lithics of roughly the same age, are differentially weathered. We conclude that wind is the main weathering agent, mostly affecting artifacts deposited on inactive terraces or interfluves, where they remain persistently at the surface. Consequently, we stress the importance of considering taphonomic, geomorphologic and archaeological factors together when trying to establish relative chronologies.

Surprisingly, controversies on the natural vs. anthropic character of several lithic assemblages or ‘industries’ did not prompt the adoption of taphonomic approaches by lithic analysts on a regular basis. Here I argue that archaeologist’s lack of knowledge about the effects of taphonomic mechanisms -whether natural or cultural- on stone and other knappable materials is the main obstacle towards a more comprehensive analysis of lithic assemblages. Furthermore, I propose that the study of taphonomic patterns (or background noise) in non-archaeological contexts is a mandatory task that researchers need to undertake in every region to achieve a more thorough understanding of lithic assemblage formation processes and trends. From the perspective advocated here both naturalistic and experimental constituents of actualistic taphonomic research are key to identify the agents involved in the formation of any fossil record.

Unfortunately, Serbia has very few open-air sites, requiring us to use other sources of evidence as proxies for understanding the Paleolithic record in lowland areas.

This presentation describes the Paleolithic surface material gathered from Pleistocene river terraces in Serbia and how researchers are using it to understand the Paleolithic record in the country outside of cave contexts.

","Paleolithic","Digital Archaeology: GIS","Landscape Archaeology","Lithic surface scatters comprise a large proportion of the archaeological record but their value for understanding human behavior is often doubted. Modern geomorphological processes often laterally displace and selectively bias surface assemblages of artifacts. The predictable effects of displacement on the condition, weathering and size distributions of lithic assemblages is better understood. While topography is known to play a role in this process, the degree to which topographic variables contribute to the taphonomy of surface assemblages is understudied. Understanding how topography influences the displacement and taphonomy of surface assemblages provides a potential avenue for assessing the extent to which surface assemblages reflect past human discard patterns. We use digital terrain analysis to investigate the influence of topography on the formation of surface lithic assemblages. The modern geomorphology and topography of the lithic landscapes from the Koobi Fora Formation (Kenya) are characterized by digital elevation models obtained from unmanned aerial systems.  Spatial analysis is used to assess the relationship between the modern landscape and taphonomic attributes of surface assemblages. A discussion of the efficacy of this approach for assessing the integrity of surface assemblages is presented.

","Paleolithic","Lithic Analysis","Mobility","Large scale surface surveys represent singular insights into the landscape scale variation in behaviors. Detailed investigations of the spatial distribution of artifacts across large spatial extents allow archaeologists to investigate a landscape as a single site. Surface assemblages have the advantage of large sample sizes and large aerial extents. However, biases associated with the formation processes of surface assemblages often undermine our confidence in the behavioral inferences derived from these records. Here we investigate patterns of behavior recorded in several whole assemblage behavioral indicators for seven assemblages recovered from the Acheulean dunefield site of Elandsfontein (800 ka -1 Ma) from the Western Cape in South Africa. Large surface and excavated assemblages of stone artifacts from similar locations allow us to investigate the impact of deflation processes on behavioral inferences. We use agent based models to develop expectations about the spatial variation in behaviors across this ancient landscape. Results suggest that the processes that created deflated surface assemblages have varied impacts on whole assemblage behavioral indicators. Some of these proxies of behavior appear to provide faithful representations of patterns derived from excavated assemblages. We compare these behavioral inferences to contextual data collected from excavated contexts.

Such scholars assert that alluvial settings contained fertile soils with a higher surplus potential than estuarine habitats.  Challenging this view, other scholars stress the abundance and protein values of estuarine species. We will problematize this debate through three overlapping topics. First, to what extent have disciplinary biases underemphasized coastal productivity and settlement (c.f. Erlandson and Fitzpatrick 2006)? Second, are these biases linked to the obfuscation of coastal land use evidence via environmental changes (e.g., sea level rise or hurricanes)?

Over the past three years the National Capital Region, has been gathering data and developing an assessment of park cultural resource vulnerabilities due to climate related threats to our parks. This brief presentation will discuss those threats and highlight how some NCR parks are addressing those threats.

Whether goods are exchanged for social, political or cultural capital, the model for examining the practice is based on a commodity framework. However, gift exchange is also a performance, often with proscribed behaviors based on the culture and the individuals participating in the exchange. This behavior clearly falls within the realm of ritual as much as that of trade or economics. In this paper I discuss gift exchange as a performed ritual both within and across cultural groups. Furthermore, while gift exchange is a behavior between individuals, it often has larger ramifications for the communities these individuals inhabit. For example, gift exchange between political leaders may influence the lives of everyone within their society. This link between social organization and gift exchange is an important aspect of its power as a ritual behavior. In particular, I will discuss how ancient Greek elites used gift exchange as an important unifying ritual in order to connect disparate communities in order to maintain cooperative relationships.","3044","Symposium","Presenter","Ivy_Faulkner",3044,1,8,"9","2.25",NA,"Symposium",2.25,"Th-evening"

These characteristics indicate that the sites would have been major foci of ceremonial activity, and would have impacted the ceremonial activity itself.  Although excavations have largely focused on the sites themselves, archaeologists have long acknowledged the importance of the larger “sacred” landscape in which these major ceremonial sites are situated, postulating that their proximity, visually and physically, to other sites in the landscape would have had an important effect on the performance and experience of ritual and ceremony. As such, these landscapes are not “monolithic” entities of sacredness, but have unique developmental trajectories that may have played an important role in shaping and reflecting emerging ideas in the local community.  This paper seeks to understand how the development and evolution of the larger landscape would have impacted the local performance and experience of ritual and ceremony at Dún Ailinne.

Imposing monuments such as Dún Ailinne, Navan Fort, and Rathcrogan have provided tantalizing glimpses into ritual and ceremonial performances of the Irish Iron Age (~500 BC-AD 500). Communal feasting has been suggested to be a key practice at these sites during the later periods of use. At feasts, social structure and identity are reinforced, wealth is redistributed, and political alliances are formed. In this way, feasts become a space for community concerns to be negotiated. The large hilltop complexes, however, are not the only ritual spaces in Iron Age Ireland. During the later prehistoric period, there is a proliferation of smaller ceremonial enclosures and barrow burials. Variation in ritual performance at these different sites provide insights into cultural concerns across different scales of society.

However, both Boas and his Indigenous collaborator George Hunt remained dissatisfied with the published text, laboring for decades to correct and supplement it. They left behind a vast archive of materials related to the book’s creation and afterlife that are now widely distributed across institutional, disciplinary, and international borders. This paper discusses a collaborative project to create an annotated critical edition of the work that unites published and unpublished materials with museum collections and with Kwakwaka’wakw knowledge in an interactive, multimedia website. Archival revelations about the truly co-authored nature of the original text allow us to better situate the contexts and methods of creating ethnographic knowledge in terms of the Indigenous ontologies it purports to represent. We are harnessing digital technologies to return sensory richness to Boas and Hunt’s synthetic text, to reactivate disparate and long dormant museum collections, and to restore cultural patrimony to its Indigenous inheritors.

Yet in the twentieth century, ancient monuments and object sets also have been divided -- and new sets created--whether by national museums or research institutions seeking to trade duplicates or by players in the art market hoping to increase return by splitting paired or assembled objects. Such divisions are problematic, for new assemblages often frame modern understandings of them, and evidence for original assemblage may be difficult or impossible to reconstruct. This paper thus explores the importance of considering objects not just on their own but also in relation to other pieces to which they were connected.

Using paleoethnobotanical data, I present data from the Wari site of Cerro Baúl and the Huaracane site of Yahuay Alta in the Moquegua Valley, Peru. I investigate not only how Wari incursion impacted Huaracane foodways, but also how local environmental and social conditions shaped Wari food practices. A consideration of food remains will not only distinguish what can be considered uniquely Wari or Huaracane cuisine, but also how foodways may have developed on either side of the colonial encounter. More specifically, this study begins to characterize: 1) the alcoholic beverage chicha de molle as a medium of Wari culture that could be consumed by local communities; and 2) how the selective adoption and internalization of Wari chicha de molle by Huaracane communities may have shaped the colonial encounter.

Jecosh offers an ideal case study to examine Wari presence in the region due to its strategic location along important trade routes.

In contrast, ethnohistoric accounts from within Tlaxcallan emphasize a state that intentionally separated itself from the Aztecs in ideology, social organization, and political and economic alliances, actively challenging the encroaching empire.

Only recently have archaeological investigations begun to demonstrate the diversity that characterized the Postclassic Basin of Mexico. Recent archaeological excavations at Xaltocan recovered the remains of successive structures that once housed Xaltocan’s Postclassic political leaders. The structures and their associated artifacts reveal the distinctive political strategies utilized by Xaltocan’s leaders. New revelations concerning the nature of leadership at Xaltocan, combined with other archaeological evidence from across the site, contradict or call into question certain long held historical assumptions about how Basin of Mexico polities functioned on the eve of the Aztec conquest.","3036","Symposium","Presenter","Kirby_Farah",3036,0,13,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Th-evening"

These actions range from removing original population and disperse them along the empire to repopulate the new region with groups loyal to the Incas. These relocation measures would have created disruption in the regional interaction networks. In the Central-South Coast, written documents indicate that the Coayllos from the Asia valley repopulated the Cañete Valley after the Inca conquest.

For example, alliances, arranged marriages and ritual performances served to consolidate internal diversity and manage external challenges to the imperial façade. The historical record (a largely imperial perspective) often portrays encountered polities in subservient ways - as allies, as belligerent, as barbaric, or as the “other”. Yet, empires were invariably constrained by the actions of competing and incorporated polities, who complicated the imperial narratives through their conscious or inadvertent engagements with the empire.The papers in this session center on material evidence from recent archaeological research to challenge historical imperial narratives, and explore the spectrum of imperial influence in local material cultural expression. Specifically, we look at the Inka in the Central Andes and the Aztec in Mesoamerica. In using a comparative approach, this session aims to characterize the relationships that developed during the emergence, consolidation and maintenance of the two largest and most prominent American Empires.

Field school excavations conducted between 1946 and 1960 uncovered compelling traces of immigrants from the Kayenta region of far northeastern Arizona and southeastern Utah. Noting evidence of a fire in the part of the pueblo referred to as the Maverick Mountain phase roomblock, and the rarity of Maverick Mountain Series pottery in deposits post-dating the conflagration, Haury concluded that the locals at Point of Pines burned these rooms in order to drive the Kayenta immigrants out. Recent research with the site’s collections and their associated records has revealed indications of ritual architectural closure behavior similar to that documented at the Homol’ovi villages, a key indicator being enriched deposits. The nature of these deposits suggests that, rather than the locals, the immigrants set fire to the roomblock.

Ethnographic evidence indicates that prophets realize their visions, in part, by transforming relationships between people and material objects. They shun, embrace, or reorient technologies, artifacts, and architecture.  Not surprisingly, in cultures where spiritual forces already animate artifacts and architecture, such reorganizations can produce dramatic changes in material culture. Much of the revitalization and crisis cult literature has logically focused on the role that colonialism played in creating new religious movements. Prehistoric contexts, however, exhibit a broader range of underexplored contexts such as environmental stress, disease, and war. The ethnographic and historical records of the American Southwest suggest revitalization movements extend far into the past. We argue that widespread changes in material culture associated with significant inflection points in southwestern prehistory (circa A.D. 700s, 1000s, and 1300s) document the work of ancient prophets.

Historical ecology offers a holistic landscape approach to a phenomenon that archaeologically has often been viewed through shifts in diet and butchering practices. This study examines the creation of range practices at Spanish colonial Mission Lost Santos Angeles de Guevavi, near what is today Nogales, Arizona. Using multiple lines of evidence, this paper proposes a set of indicators to identify semi-feral ranching in both the archaeological and historical record. Isotopic evidence shows that semi-desert grasslands were most affected by the introduction of cattle and sheep. Faunal and historical analyses suggest cattle ages were loosely monitored, and animals were culled at an older age than optimal for meat and grease extractive strategies. These findings indicate a low investment strategy, which may have helped indigenous groups maintain traditional agricultural and gathering practices, augmenting their resilience in the colonial period. Finally, this paper explores how semi-feral cattle ranching was sustainable under historical conditions, but has since become an ecologically and politically problematic practice in the modern American West and used to justify U.S. federal interventions without community consultation on reservations.","3014","Symposium","Presenter","Nicole_Mathwich",3014,0,8,"8","2",NA,"Symposium",2,"Th-evening"

We bring attention to the community of scholars who engage with historical ecology and present the case for a historical ecology interest group within the Society for American Archaeology.

First, while project members had identified a series of fortified centers and palisades in the region’s hinterlands, the recent identification of fortifications in the near periphery of Piedras Negras makes it one of the rare polity capitals in the southern Maya lowlands where such features have been reported. Second, while regional research had revealed evidence for craft production and exchange, prior evidence for craft production at Piedras Negras was relatively scant. Recent excavations have significantly altered this perspective and changed our understandings of economic integration at the capital and across the kingdom.  Third, prior subsistence and diet research largely focused on soils and bone isotopes, while the present project adds the complexity of research into plant economies. Further, project participants have begun to draw together the disparate threads of settlement research to produce a more integrative picture of settlement dynamics. Finally, a return to Piedras Negras has also afforded the opportunity to further conserve the site and engage with local stakeholders for long-term protection.","3006","Symposium","Presenter","Andrew_Scherer",3006,0,10,"10","2.5",NA,"Symposium",2.5,"Th-evening"

","Maya: Classic","Lithic Analysis","Political Economy","Analysis of the production of imported lithic artifacts, especially obsidian and jade, has been important to recent research on the economic organization of the lowland Maya. However, the data for lithic production has come from a few key sites with clear evidence of workshops devoted to the working of such materials. Less attention has been dedicated to the diversity of obsidian and jade working within individual sites, much less across a given kingdom. This paper presents preliminary evidence for heterogeneity in obsidian and jade working in the kingdom of Piedras Negras, notable for being at the tail end in the exchange of obsidian, jade, and other imported lithic goods. The focus is especially on the diversity of production in household versus non-household areas, drawing comparisons with known market and production areas in Mexico and Guatemala, highlighting the connection with the subordinate center of Budsilha that yielded the best evidence to date for lithic production activities, to better understand regional economic dynamics. Macroscopic analyses are complemented by the results of XRF analysis.

From an archaeological standpoint this effort necessitates careful study of the spatial contexts of recovered artifacts – and of the human activities that left them behind – to capture different forms of mobility. Analysis of spatial data from archaeological and geoarchaeological surveys using GIS has already illustrated important relationships between different kinds of sites in the region around Basanga, Zambia, with implications for the kinds of daily, seasonal, and long-term movements that connected the people living and working in those places. Similarly, using GIS to combine such data with that available from satellite imagery has enabled the creation of a predictive model for the location of other sites, and which concerns from a mobile, Bantu-speaking community might have driven those selections, that can be evaluated through remote sensing and further survey.","2998","Symposium","Presenter","Matthew_Pawlowicz",2998,0,12,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-evening"

Traditionally, space syntax is undertaken using access analysis graphs for individual buildings, and axial maps for towns, which allow researchers to comprehend the configuration of space formally represented as connected points and lines in a network. This paper presents a selection of illustrative case studies on how space syntax can work with remote sensing data, GIS databases and other analytical tools, and adapted to address specific research questions and historical cultural contexts in Africa. Street network analyses of West African historic towns and structural examinations of preserved stone buildings on various sites along the Swahili coast are used to show in what ways space syntax graphs can be adjusted to the current research agenda. Investigation of the built environment using complex graphical representations of its spatial partitioning and culturally embedded properties may include sensory perceptions such as vision and kinaesthetics.","2998","Symposium","Presenter","Monika_Baumanova",2998,0,12,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-evening"

The preliminary results of this research demonstrate that settlement favoured areas close to perennial and ephemeral fluvial systems.

Since the time available for the fieldwork was limited to two weeks, the survey focused on examining specific areas of the site to document certain architectural features, and in several locations where industrial activities were known to have occurred based on previous limited excavations.  Additionally, a region identified as a “tophet”, a sacred burial precinct for infants, was examined during the survey.  Goals for the GPR survey were different in each area examined, and the results will aid in future excavations and paleoecological reconstructions.
Results from all survey areas will be briefly mentioned, but the paper will emphasize two main target areas.  Two industrial sectors were surveyed, where iron metallurgy was practiced, and total slag volumes are estimated to assess the ecological legacy of the industry.  A second area of emphasis was the “tophet” burial precinct, for which the GPR survey produced unexpectedly clear results that enable analysis of the mortuary landscape.

Seeking to better chart the interplay between natural environment and social history across this region over the past two millennia, the Bandafassi Regional Archaeological Project (BRAP) has since 2013 begun to integrate survey and excavation data on past human activities with spatial analyses of the relations among sites and geographical features. This paper explores three applications of Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite imagery within the BRAP research program: (1) mapping geomorphological features across the regional landscape; (2) developing a predictive model of site locations for future survey; and (3) interpreting how the physical landscape has historically enabled and constrained the social production of identity, including “traditional” ethnic boundaries, in southeastern Senegal. The paper concludes by raising methodological caveats and ethical concerns about the use of satellite imagery in the archaeology of Africa.","2998","Symposium","Presenter","Cameron_Gokee",2998,0,12,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-evening"

Humans have inhabited southern Ghanaian forest for millennia, and nearly everywhere there are traces of human activity in the deep past. This paper discusses my integration of satellite remote sensing with traditional archaeological field methods to study longue durée continuity and transformation in both West African societies and the landscape itself. I am consolidating previous survey data and expanding upon them using several methods of archaeological survey and remote sensing with the broader goal of tracing cultural patterns in the landscape using GIS. Specifically, my work has been testing the informed hypothesis that many sacred groves, hilltops, and low rises in the coastal hinterlands and forests of Ghana were the settlement sites of agricultural communities in the first and early second millennium A.D. To do this I used a combination of satellite imagery analysis, topographic information, and archaeological survey to predictively model and test where these sites will be located based on this hypothesis. I will also discuss some of the similarities, differences, successes, and limitations I have encountered while using remotely sensed satellite imagery for archaeological survey, in direct reference to my previous work identifying archaeological sites through vegetation patterns in Sierra Leone.","2998","Symposium","Presenter","Sean_Reid",2998,0,12,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-evening"

Community elders guided us along winding footpaths that ascended 9 mountain tops leading to settlements that were first occupied in the early 13th century and have now been abandoned for nearly 100 years. Surrounding these historic settlements are sacred groves with springs, caves, and boulders that give physical evidence in their Indigenous religion of the animation of the non-human world. Yet, the canopy of trees also harbored cemeteries, Orthodox Churches, and stacked stone walls, berms, and trenches that reveal a history of conflict. We use Geographic Information Systems software in conjunction with collected locational data, physiographic and land cover data, oral traditions, toponymical associations, historic maps, and other documents to build historic settlement and environmental models. Using spatial data in collaboration with community knowledge we can begin to understand the complex local histories related to the introduction of Christianity, conflict, and environmental change.

Two common approaches involve: 1) analyzing the relative sizes of sites to evaluate possible site size hierarchies, and 2) analyzing the spatial distribution of sites across landscapes to evaluate possible clustering or dispersion. This paper applies more statistically rigorous methods that commonly employed, namely Ripley’s K Multi-Distance Spatial Cluster Analysis to evaluate possible spatial clustering/dispersion, and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) analysis to evaluate possible site size categories/hierarchies. These methods are performed on archaeological site data from two distinct areas of the northern Ethiopian highlands collected by the Eastern Tigray Archaeological Project (ETAP) and Southern Red Sea Archaeological Histories (SRSAH) Project. Results show strikingly similar patterns in the two areas, including an increase in the number of sites and decrease in average site size over time, site clustering only during the Pre-Aksumite period, and a lack of site size hierarchies that are predicted by traditional models of state-level settlement patterns.","2998","Symposium","Presenter","Joseph_Mazzariello",2998,0,12,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-evening"

From local houses, to regional landscapes, to global entanglements, the spatial relations among people, places, and things at these multiple scales offer increasingly nuanced perspectives on cultural change and continuity both past and present. Meanwhile, a growing suite of spatial archaeometric techniques—including geographic information systems (GIS), satellite remote sensing, aerial and UAV imaging, laser scanning, and geophysical prospection—have become ever more  valuable tools for documenting, interpreting, and preserving archaeological resources. The time thus seems ripe for a critical conversation among Africanist scholars about the ways in which we integrate geospatial analysis into our research. In this session we propose to explore the current interplay between spatial archaeometry and socio-spatial theory through case studies from historical and geographic contexts across Africa.

Legacies of earlier generations of anthropological scholarship encourage researchers to assume particular traits of sociopolitical organization. Archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence from the Cuzco region of Peru demonstrates how such assumptions can be an obstacle to developing accurate representations of social organization.  As Inca elites extended power in the Cuzco region (AD 1200-1400), they interacted with diverse societies that did not all resemble the monolithic Andean ayllu. One compelling case for reconsidering ayllu organization is Yunkaray, seat of the powerful Ayarmaca polity, located near Maras, 35 km northwest of Cuzco.

This paper uses ethnohistory, regional settlement patterns, and excavation results from Yunkaray to note divergences from classic ayllu attributes. We identify camelid herding as a potentially integrative force in pre-Inca community formation, and examine the public performance of community identity in relation to Yunkaray’s neighboring polities. We trace the enduring Yunkaray community through its sociopolitical apogee and the subsequent forced resettlement of its residents by the Incas. Finally, we consider how the imagined community of Ayarmacas relates to local ayllus that coalesced in the early Colonial period, especially through processes of Spanish resettlement.","2993","Symposium","Presenter","Kylie_Quave",2993,0,11,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Th-evening"

Recent archaeological research from Andahuaylas suggests that the majority of aggregated Chanka phase ridgetop sites were likely inhabited by neither specialized agriculturalists nor camelid pastoralists, but rather populations which identified as agro-pastoralists. The paper suggests that threats of attacks by neighboring populations and climate induced economic risk, may have tethered populations to smaller localized territories which encouraged more fluid socio-politico-cultural identities. The author argues that hilltop communities in Andahuaylas may have witnessed a shift to a more integrated and inclusive socio-ethnic identity rooted in an agro-pastoral subsistence economy.

I draw on the archaeological record of the Titicaca Basin for a preliminary exploration of this question. The production regimes used by Titicaca Basin peoples changed markedly over time, shifting from intensified agriculture in the Middle Horizon to relatively risk-averse strategies of pastoralism and rain-fed terrace cultivation in the LIP. But notwithstanding many basic cultural similarities among LIP Titicaca Basin societies, there are significant contrasts across this large region in the opportunities the land affords for farming and herding and the relative importance of these activities in late pre-Columbian times.

This shift in the location of some communities might also reflect increasing economic specialization between farming and herding communities, as has been seen in some other Andean zones at this time.

Variability in spatial patterning, foodways, and ceramic production and use points to diverging patterns of organization among local Cajamarca communities at this time.

Migrations of people, animals and ideas were widespread in antiquity and these are frequently incorporated into expressions of cultural identity. However, the more recent the migrations, the more negative modern attitudes are towards them. In general, native is perceived as positive and 'natural', whereas the term 'alien' is attached negatively to cultural and environmental problems. This paper will explore these value-judgements through the example of Easter, the most important event in the Christian calendar.

The Easter festival and its associated animals - namely the brown hare, rabbit and chicken - are all 'alien' to most of the areas in where Easter is celebrated. This paper will focus on the integrated use of scientific approaches (genetics, GMM and isotopes) with evidence from traditional (zoo)archaeology, art history, and historical linguistics to investigate the human-mediated dispersal of the brown hare and rabbit in connection with the Easter cult. It will argue that the cultural and temporal context of these ‘alien’ introductions are key factors for both understanding the origins of Easter and challenging widespread negative attitudes towards cultural and biological 'aliens'.

","Bronze Age","Zooarchaeology","Subsistence and Foodways","Zooarchaeologists have often employed binary oppositions such as urban consumers and rural producers, and distinguish between centralized/regulated and decentralized/unregulated animal economies with direct/indirect food provisioning systems to elucidate pastoral economies of early complex societies. As zooarchaeologists, we are tasked with bridging more abstract and ideational anthropological variables with the archaeological hard evidence as well as with a narrower set of more explicit zooarchaeological measures; thus, moving from heavily fragmented animal bones to complex and abstract human behaviors. A large corpus of cuneiform tablets from the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000-1750 BC) urban center of Kanesh (the archaeological site of Kültepe, Kayseri, Turkey) provide direct and indirect evidence for various aspects of agropastoral economy and offer detailed information on food ways with specific reference to animals. Thus, we have a unique opportunity to question the applicability and meaningfulness of dichotomized approaches to organization of every state or society in the ancient Near East or elsewhere. Theoretically, I focus on centralization and bureaucratic control, asymmetrical access and inequalities, and production-distribution-consumption dynamics. Methodologically, I bring together as many independent lines of evidence as possible with special emphasis on combined use of zooarchaeological and historical data to develop comprehensive and fine-resolution pictures.

I employ zooarchaeological methods to assess the intensity of site occupation based on the degree of hunting pressure that humans placed on small game from the environment immediately surrounding the site. Taphonomic analysis of faunal refuse deposition is used to further illuminate the use of space, namely cleaning practices.

How is it that Tlaloc took on this attribute, and what did it mean in the context of the Mexica?

Classic Maya stelae have been proposed as precursors for the Early Postclassic stelae at Tula and the relief pillars of Pyramid B at the site in previous scholarship. While suggested Maya connections for the Tula stelae are often overstated, and local central Mexican stela traditions as well as ideas from Oaxaca and Guerrero also probably contributed to the genesis of these monuments, the role of Maya contacts remains plausible. Here I explore possible Maya analogs, including stelae, for the famed atlantid columns of Pyramid B. While in style and construction these sculptures reflect the legacy of Teotihuacan, their use of elite or royal images as literal pillars has conceptual parallels in Classic Maya stelae equating kings with trees, pillars of the sky and the axis mundi. I also critically assess the possible connection, first proposed by Kubler, between the Tula atlantids and the Terminal Classic figure columns of the Puuk area. While these similarities may reflect a common Mesoamerican background rather than direct contact, recent dating of the Tula sculptural style to 650-850 CE at Tula Chico increases the probability of interaction.

The visual scarcity of this crop extends into divine imagery – for instance, cacao remained an important aspect of Ek’ Chuah, the Postclassic Maya merchant god, but does not appear among the connotations of his almost-identical Mexica counterpart known as Yacatecuhtli. This disconnection between visual versus economic consumption resonates with ethnohistorical evidence of an anxiety over cacao due to its luxurious and foreign nature – and by extension the larger tensions inherent in relationships with long-distance trade goods. In this work, I examine not only what foreign goods appear in the visual vocabulary of the Mexica, but the connotations of ‘place’ in their artistic contexts. In addition, I argue that the dearth of cacao iconography reflects larger tensions.

Not only was Lingnan distant from imperial centers in the north, its native pre-literate ‘Yue’ inhabitants spoke non-sinitic languages and were known for their distinctive ‘uncivilized’ behaviors. Along with its location at the southern margin of modern China’s territory, the fact that political, cultural and material elements originating north of it did have a significant impact on Lingnan’s long-term development further helps mark the region as ‘peripheral’. However, by focusing on unidirectional currents emanating from distant political centers, one risks underestimating the influence of areas ‘beyond the periphery’, as the case of Lingnan illustrates when one takes into account material and cultural elements which reached southern China along the ‘Maritime Silk Road’. Having said this, the mere act of ‘centering’ so-called peripheral regions for the purpose of understanding local change is in itself insufficient, as the analysis must consider not only the origin of single elements of interaction, but also their magnitude, impact, and the extent of their social and spatial penetration at the local level.","3035","Symposium","Presenter","Francis_Allard",3035,0,9,"9","2.25",NA,"Symposium",2.25,"Th-afternoon"

","Bronze Age","Other","Frontiers and Borderlands","Archaeological schools of thought vary between countries, with the discipline growing along disparate theoretical trajectories dependent on the historical particulars of a nation’s academic traditions. Often distance between such diverging theoretical trajectories is mitigated by communication and collaboration across borders between scholars. However, the Cold War that divided Western and Soviet nations geographically, politically, and culturally also applied to archaeological research, as the flow of information and people across borders was stifled. Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the mostly normalized relations that developed afterwards, a scholarly Iron Curtain has remained, diminished but enduring. Though certainly not as rigid as decades past, such a divide is visible in the limited number of American scholars conducting research in modern Russian, and in the exclusion of Russian research from our narratives about the prehistoric and ancient past. This paper examines the legacy of the Cold War in American archaeology, specifically in relation to the marginalization of Russian archaeological phenomena in our popular narratives. Ultimately, the peripheralization of these phenomena and regions does not result from anything that existed in pre- or ancient history, but in the modern political and cultural context’s shaping of archaeological thought and practice.","3035","Symposium","Presenter","Nicole_Rose",3035,0,9,"9","2.25",NA,"Symposium",2.25,"Th-afternoon"

","Bronze Age","Other","Materiality","Archaeologists studying prehistoric Eurasian steppe pastoral lifeways often seek inclusion into comparative research of urbanism, craft production, and complexity. Even as these studies contribute valuable information, they also reify their place in the intellectual periphery of archaeological inquiry. This peripheralization is due to several factors. First, the Eurasian steppe is perhaps unwittingly conceptualized as a relatively timeless socio-geographical periphery to “state-level” social entities located to the adjacent south - western Asia, south-central Asia, and east Asia. Second, this peripheralization is ultimately a spatially-derived frame of mind, one that essentializes and promotes geographic and cultural space over equally important considerations of time and materiality. In the following paper, I interrogate the spatio-centric mindsets that permeate current studies of Eurasian steppe pastoral social groups; a mindset that contributes to the further marginalization of pastoral-based case studies in anthropological archaeology. To break out of this exclusionary mindset, I explore the ways in which meaning was made in Bronze Age pastoral groups through a more inclusive inquiry drawing upon ethnographic and archaeological case studies to illustrate how pastoralists engaged with time and materials (as well as space) as they undergo periods of social change and continuity.","3035","Symposium","Presenter","James_Johnson",3035,0,9,"9","2.25",NA,"Symposium",2.25,"Th-afternoon"

Some scholars have suggested that pre-Columbian Appalachia has remained peripheral in archaeological discourse because it comprised the geographic edge of different cultural expressions (e.g., Mississippian, Morrow Mountain) or interaction spheres. In this paper, we argue that Appalachia’s recurring position as a cultural boundary renders it uniquely suited for studying pre-Columbian interaction and connectivity. Drawing on spatial and contextual data from the New River headwaters of northwestern North Carolina, we attempt to reframe the southern Appalachians as socially and symbolically central to Woodland period events and histories, and we propose new lines of archaeological research to further interrogate erroneous impressions of the region’s inaccessibility, isolation, and cultural inertia.","3035","Symposium","Presenter","Alice_Wright",3035,0,9,"9","2.25",NA,"Symposium",2.25,"Th-afternoon"

 This paper will focus on the integrated use of genetics, GMM and isotopes to reconstruct individual and population life-histories of prehistoric Arctic domestic dogs. This combination of interrelated analyses allows for a comprehensive investigation into genetic, morphological and dietary variability for the identification of domesticates from archaeological assemblages, and for examining the relationship between domesticates and wild canids in archaeological contexts. Our results demonstrate that this three-strand analytical investigation can shed new light on continuity and change in human-canid relationships during these periods of migration, providing valuable information about the relationship between humans and animals in prehistory, and the complex cultural and technological diffusions of successive human migrations across the Arctic.","3032","Symposium","Presenter","Carly_Ameen",3032,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Th-afternoon"

I rely primarily on data from Çatalhöyük in central Anatolia, where I have extensive contextual information, supported by patterning from other PPNB/early Pottery Neolithic sites. Drawing on the contextual analysis of animal bones, burial practices, and animal representations, I argue that dogs were not regarded in the same way as wild animals, but that they held greater spiritual power than domestic sheep and goats. This power is evident through taboos: on human consumption of dogs, and on dogs entering occupied houses. However, dogs lived near specific houses, and in death their primary role was the protection of houses and their dead human inhabitants, rather than of individual humans.","3032","Symposium","Presenter","Nerissa_Russell",3032,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Th-afternoon"

Further, as part of developing that framework, we suggest that in certain cases, simultaneous human-dog interments may not so much have reflected one or more dogs being buried with people, but rather one or more people being buried with dogs.

","Paleolithic","Bone Tool Analysis","Quantitative and Spatial Analysis","It has been argued that Aurignacian projectile points made of antler, bone, or ivory represent a proxy for the initial dispersal of Homo sapiens into Europe. Our research reassesses this claim by using geometric morphometric analysis to study 547 Aurignacian osseous implements recovered from 49 European sites. This approach allowed the identification of eight volumetric templates reproduced by Aurignacian artisans during the manufacture of split-based points. Two templates were identified for massive-based points, one of which includes a number of variants. Spatial and chronological distribution of these templates suggests the dominant hypothesis must be reconsidered. We argue that Aurignacian armatures signal the development of innovative socioeconomic strategies by groups already present on the continent and linked to one another. In this case, the osseous armatures would have conferred an adaptive technological solution to prehistoric groups engaged in increased mobility. The subsequent adoption of the innovation at a continental scale must be linked with the dispersal of the Campanian Ignimbrite tephra. Finally, the replacement of split-based points by massive-based points suggests that an important transformation occurred in the technological strategies (i.e., curation versus expediency) implemented by earlier and later Aurignacians even though they favoured a similar mobility pattern.","3030","Symposium","Presenter","Luc_Doyon",3030,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-afternoon"

Those strategies should select longer-term residential sites that are environmentally relatively stable at a very local scale, and are surrounded by more rapidly changing landscapes that provide logistical access to a variety of resources.

Originally, these traits were thought to be adaptations to an open environment. However, discoveries of older hominins, such as Ardipithecus that were possibly only occasionally bipedal and did not have enlarged teeth, have refocused the origins of early hominins within a much more closed, wooded setting. Even the later australopithecines are currently cast as inhabitants of mosaic environments encompassing some closed habitats. However, research in some localities that clearly sample closed habitats do not yield hominins. The four million-year-old Mursi Formation of southern Ethiopia is a good example: its fauna, and stable isotopes values from mammalian teeth and paleosol carbonates suggest a fairly closed woody cover, more so than in penecontemporaneous localities of the region. Yet, the Mursi Formation has no hominins while the other localities with dryer and more open habitats do, suggesting that early hominins could not occupy exclusively closed habitat and were reliant on resources found in more open settings. This type of habitat was novel and different from those exploited by our closest relatives, the great apes, and might be a defining characteristic at the origins of the human lineage.","3030","Symposium","Presenter","Michelle_Drapeau",3030,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-afternoon"

To quantify the effects of these dispersals on the environment, and to better understand demographic development over the period, I implemented a new, computationally efficient numerical representation of human population dynamics and dispersal and incorporated this into a dynamic global vegetation model. This coupled model of human and natural systems simulates the way in which climate and other properties of the physical environment affected suitability for hunter-gatherer populations, while at the same time allowing humans to modify their local environment, i.e., niche construction, through the controlled application of wildland fire. Our model simulations show that humans could substantially influenced their environment even during the Last Glacial Maximum, selectively using fire to promote more open and heterogeneous landscapes.

This symposium will highlight an array of methodologies and regional studies in Old and New World archaeology that are concerned with the causes and contexts of human mobility within the coupled interactions of environmental and human social systems. Our objective is to bring together researchers that employ agent-based simulation, paleoenvironmental modelling, geographical information systems, landscape theory, and morphological analyses as we explore two key questions: what are the archaeological signatures of mobility as human-environmental interaction, and how should these signatures be studied? The symposium will also showcase current work from the Hominin Dispersal Research Group (HDRG), a multi-institutional, collaborative research cluster based out of l’Université de Montréal concerned with the study of dispersal events.","3030","Symposium","Chair (Primary)","Dario_Guiducci",3030,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-afternoon"

","Historic","Digital Archaeology: GIS","Historical Archaeology","Caribbean Sugar production during the 18th and 19th centuries expanded rapidly, fueled by increasing proletariat consumption across the globe.  In response, sugar planters in 18th century Antigua, West Indies, deforested over 90 percent of the landscape, carving the island into proto-industrialized plantations defined by sugarcane monoculture and labored by enslaved Africans. New World plantation organization was once ascribed as a balance between profit and surveillance: simultaneously maximizing control over the landscape and enslaved labor.  However, evidence from Antigua questions aspects of these earlier notions.  This paper examines the socio-spatiality of the late 18th century Antiguan plantationscape. Specifically, this research builds upon the analysis of Bates (2015) in Jamaica and Nevis, conducting a diachronic and synchronic analysis of seven different plantations in Antigua owned by the Codrington family, including Betty’s Hope [1655-1944], New Works [before 1710], Cotton Estate [before 1710], Tuitts Estate [before 1750], Rooms Estate [1717-1852], Clare Hall [1814-1848 (at least)], Jennings Estate [1772-1815], and Bolans Estate [1772-1815] to determine whether plantation layout sought to maximize profit or surveillance. Our research shows that Antiguan plantations underwent several transformations aimed at profit extraction at the expense of surveillance, reflecting a much more heterogeneous 18th century island landscape.","3029","Symposium","Presenter","Christopher_Waters",3029,1,10,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Th-afternoon"

","Historic","Other","Historical Archaeology","Studies of industrial production have taken a prominent position within social theory. Social implications of factories and productive landscapes in the Caribbean have often been obscured by the socio-cultural palimpsest of plantation environments. Material culture studies of Caribbean factories, both structures and machinery, can be vital descriptors regarding enslaved and emancipated labour narratives. The connection between industrialisation, machinery, slavery, and manumission underlies major themes of the plantation organism. The industrialisation of the factory complex generated a newly habituated space and altered perceptions of workspaces from one of slavery and semi-artisanal, cottage-manufacture to constant mechanised motion, noise and ‘free’-production. Using the term anthropomorphic-machinism to cover both the relationship of workers to technologies being manipulated, it is possible to characterise the effect of machinery on the organisms themselves (labourers). Despite their continued financial confinement, Abolition marked the ‘freedom’ of the labourer from the yolk of oppressive production. The introduction of industrialised steam machinery replaced the corporeal labour of the enslaved. The relationships developed between the labourer and the workplace is depicted within their interaction with procedure, machinery, technology and, eventually, the product.

This research was facilitated by study of human remains mitigated from a Naval Hospital cemetery in response to modern development. The interred at the site were lower ranking naval personnel including enslaved individuals. Other work on lead exposure in the region focused on enslaved plantation laborers revealed high levels of the toxic metal in skeletal elements which was attributed to exposure in sugar processing. The work presented here focuses on enslaved African laborers in a military context. The patterns of lead exposure for this group are compared and contrasted with those of both the regular naval personnel and enslaved Africans in a plantation context. Similarities and differences seen in the lead burden of the bony remains between these three groups that were connected to the sugar industry in different capacities highlight into the variability in lived experiences of enslaved Africans in the colonial Caribbean.

The production, consumption, and exchange of these commodities from the late 15th century onwards quickly infiltrated the European social sphere.  In the 17th century, the production of these commodities increased at a time when dispossessed European laborers were transformed into the new urban proletariat. Dubbed earlier as the “Commercial Revolution,” the expansion of these commodities directly altered the fabric of life across Africa and the Circum-Caribbean. Sugar, coffee, and rum were also influential in forming new European modes and ideas regarding capitalism and industry in the 18th century. This session seeks to evaluate how these products transformed from the exotic to the “…daily fare of even the poorest and humblest people” (Mintz 1985:6). How did the ever-increasing economic demand for such products alter the lives of enslaved Africans, alter the Caribbean landscape, and contribute to contemporary colonial legacies across the Caribbean?

The site provides important data on the history of human occupation of desert environments during the Late Pleistocene.

Based on the assumption that survival in the often unpredictable environments of SE Arabia requires increased behavioral flexibility and risk minimizing strategies this paper examines Jebel Faya’s Paleolithic stone artifact assemblages with regard to economization of lithic raw material and the intensification of social relations. Attributes such as production efficiency and re-use potential represent raw material economization, while technological complexity, occupation intensity and raw material provisioning are used to deduce an indirect estimate for the intensity of social relations. To assess the degree of economization and social relation, the archaeological assemblages are compared to data modeled under optimality assumption using a probabilistic approach based on Naïve Bayes classifier. These results were used to track changes in social relations and raw material economy through the archaeological sequence from Jebel Faya to see if these data provide meaningful information on differences in social learning.","3028","Symposium","Presenter","Knut_Bretzke",3028,1,10,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Th-afternoon"

This paper explores the consequences of the physical constraints within lithic technology on its cultural transmission, using a spatially-explicit agent-based model.

We measure the number of learning events produced under the different constraints within flintknapping that reside at the heart of this debate. These constraints include where the learning occurred on the taskscape, the significance of the cognitive difference between strategic knowledge and tactical know-how, the degree of equifinality of products from different sequences, the generative entrenchment between products and sequences, and the size of the parameter space of lithic technology.

The emergence of similar patterning in early hominin assemblages is often assumed to track the beginnings of social learning. Less clear is what was being socially transmitted during this early period. One possibility is that hominins learned how to make objects according to a shared ‘mental template’. A second possibility is that specific sequences were learned, which led to repeated forms. Here we describe recent experiments that explored the interplay of stone-flaking intentions and the mechanical outcomes of fracture. By removing complex ‘intent’ from the experimental design, we demonstrated that repetitions in forms and sequences can occur by removing flakes in simple series, without complex goal-directed intentions, and that some of these forms mimic aspects of objects often assumed to reflect more complex cognitive processes. The emergence of repetitive form is possible through the transmission of simple stoneworking sets, or combinations of gestures, without an a priori conception of a manufacturing process or final goal, suggesting that complex forms of social transmission may not have been necessary until relatively late in evolutionary history.","3028","Symposium","Presenter","Mark_Moore",3028,1,10,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Th-afternoon"

","Paleolithic","Lithic Analysis","Cultural Transmission","The ability to transmit cultural information with high-fidelity across generations is a defining trait of modern humans. It is unclear, however, how and when this adaptation emerged in the human lineage. The earliest forms of human technology—stone artifacts—required knappers to understand raw material mechanics, as well as geometry (volume reduction, angles), and physics. Thus, it is often assumed that the spread of lithic technologies involved some degree of information transmission. However, archaeologists lack systematic methods to study the transmission of information from lithic palimpsests. A growing interest in this topic has emphasized design theory (Carr 1995), breaking down lithic technology into a series of independent domains of lithic production (Tostevin 2012) (e.g. core orientation, platform preparation). The research presented here used controlled knapping experiments to understand the influence of varied social learning conditions on these technological domains. The ultimate goal is to define attributes that can be used as proxies for information transmission in Paleolithic assemblages. We simulated two social learning conditions: emulation (lower-fidelity) and imitation (higher-fidelity) as novice knappers were taught Levallois technology. Results suggest that attributes associated with core orientation are more strongly correlated with degree of information transfer than attributes of toolkit morphology.","3028","Symposium","Presenter","Kathryn_Ranhorn",3028,1,10,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Th-afternoon"

Here we present results from an experimental neuroarchaeology study of individual variation in handaxe-making skill acquisition. Naïve subjects received ~100 hrs training over several months, accompanied by regular behavioral, psychometric, and MRI assessments. To quantify skill, knapping performance was observed after every 10 hrs training and rated using a systematic rubric. We fit a multivariate model of artifact metrics to these ratings to derive an objective “quality” score and regressed quality scores on hours practice per subject to derive individual learning curves. The multivariate model identifies morphological correlates of knapping performance whereas parameters and values from individual learning curves can be directly compared with individual differences in brain structure and psychometric performance. Our results are an initial step toward better understanding the roles of skill acquisition and differential aptitude in generating lithic variability and shaping human neurocognitive evolution.","3028","Symposium","Presenter","Dietrich_Stout",3028,1,10,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Th-afternoon"

However, these types of relationships are heavily structured by the innate attributes of the animals involved. Pre-evolved characteristics create the set of possibilities on which human agents can act, and actions undertaken by animals without the influence of humans can have major impacts on human behavior.

While much attention has been paid to the political context of agricultural production, as well as environmental changes brought about by certain techniques, less has been paid to the active manipulation of productive environments by non-human animals. Within the context of some recent theoretical advances in archaeology and ecology, it has become apparent that animals - intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans - modify the context under which agricultural production occurs. These modified landscapes are inherited by subsequent generations of producers who are challenged to make minor, and sometimes major, adjustments based on changing landscapes. In this paper, we highlight these processes using case studies from historic North America (e.g., earthworms) and the pre-European Pacific (e.g., rats and birds).

Using ancient and modern case studies, this paper will then examine the human response to overcome the problems of material fatigue. In particular, we examine the case of the 1200 BC Cape Gelidonya Shipwreck found off the coast of southwestern Turkey, and whose cargo of copper ingot and alloy scrap metal demonstrates how some sectors of society worked alongside consumers to recycle fatigued metal.

In this paper, I use geographic information system analyses to quantitatively and qualitatively assess six elements of adaptive capacity (the amount of water harnessed by the system, investments in infrastructure, human capital, redundancy, equal distribution of resources, and innovation) for six time periods. The relationships and trade-offs among the six elements shed light on agricultural production at Angkor as well as general theory on what elements contribute to the resilience of water management systems.

While many scholars have hypothesized that these temple enclosures were loci of habitation, few have documented this archaeologically. In this paper, we present the results of two field seasons of excavation at the temple site of Ta Prohm, part of a broader research program that was the first to intensively study temple enclosures for occupation. We used lidar data to focus our excavations and sample various locations within the enclosure. This work demonstrates evidence for residential occupation within the temple enclosure from the pre-11th century CE to the 14th century. A comparison with previous work exploring habitation areas within the Angkor Wat temple enclosure highlight similarities and differences in mound construction, organization of the internal grid system, intensity of habitation, and dates of occupation. We argue that temple habitation was a key component of the Angkorian low-density urban system and that investigating this unique form of urbanism deepens current comparative research on the diversity of ancient cities.","3023","Symposium","Presenter","Alison K._Carter",3023,0,14,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-afternoon"

Rather than a homogenous blanket of state/imperial power, the result is a mosaic of core state control and local choices across the landscape. Focusing on the Angkorian Khmer Empire (9th to 15th c.

These investigations are informed through an analysis of the assemblage of provincial sandstone temples, which were key loci for the negotiation of state and intermediate elite power within the Khmer Empire. Emphasis is placed on understanding the geographic distribution of temples, the acquisition of sandstone for temple production, and temple form and organization, as variations in these variables may reflect different intermediate elite strategies and levels of agentive decision making.","3023","Symposium","Presenter","Kendall_Hills",3023,0,14,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-afternoon"

Constraints of the archaeological record limit our ability to document production scale of most activities; the genealogical skew of Angkor’s epigraphic record in another reason. Yet Greater Angkor’s gardens and fields must have fed residents in the Angkorian state’s epicenter. Artisans built its temples, sculpted temple images, and cast metal goods; specialists and communities tended temples; and voracious elites broadcast political and religious affairs in stone and through pageantry. Some archaeologists studying the multiscalar, multicentric nature of Angkorian production focus on ceramics as proxies for tracking state economy within and beyond Angkor’s urban epicenter. Stoneware ceramics were neither wealth nor staple finance; their functions complemented earthenware and metal objects; and they were ubiquitous in Angkorian households across the kingdom. Kiln excavations in three discrete Angkorian subregions have produced in-situ ceramics; field projects across Cambodia offer samples from consumption sites. Our Khmer Production and Exchange Project dates stoneware kilns and uses NAA to characterize geochemical compositions of stonewares from production and consumption sites.

This evaluation suggests that in most scenarios demographic packing triggers increasingly intensive high altitude use, that establishing semi-permanent or permanent settlements requires economic subsidization with lower-altitude resources and increasingly costly high altitude ones, and that maintenance of high altitude lifeways is tenuous and contingent upon both biological adaptation and/or articulation with larger regional economies.","3020","Symposium","Presenter","Christopher_Morgan",3020,1,13,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-afternoon"

Located in western Eurasia, at the crossroads of human migrations out of Africa during the Pleistocene, the Iranian Plateau stands at the centre of models of anatomically modern human dispersals out of Africa. This paper aims to understand the cultural diversity among the first modern human populations in the area, and the implications of this diversity to evolutionary and ecological models of human dispersal through the Iranian Plateau, by re-examining four key UP lithic assemblages from the sites Warwasi, Yafteh and Pasangar of the west central and Ghar-e Boof Cave of the southern Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The results demonstrate that there is a significant degree of cultural diversity rather than homogeneity among the UP throughout the different Zagros habitat areas as a result of the relative geo-topographical isolation of the different areas occupied favouring different ecological adaptations. Based on the chronological and geographical patterns of Zagros UP variability, we propose a model of an initial phase of localised and patchy development of the early UP in the region, with limited subsequent contact among these first UP groups. This has important implications for the origins of biological diversity in the early phases of modern human colonisation of Eurasia.","3020","Symposium","Presenter","Elham_Ghasidian",3020,1,13,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-afternoon"

Early forager sites of the Andes exhibit a spectrum of settlement and mobility configurations, which constitute responses to the structure of resources in their specific habitats. Intriguingly, some of the earliest and highest sites indicate thorough familiarity with highland resources, implying either considerable pre-existing cultural knowledge about mountains or very rapid landscape learning. Current debates center on the identification of explorations vs more permanent settlements, functional configurations of early highland sites with those in lower ecological zones, and the role of physiologic and genetic adaptations in the settlement process. Approaches relying solely on assemblages of artifacts and subsistence remains may be inadequate to resolve these issues.

","Paleolithic","Archaeometry & Materials Analysis","Trade and Exchange","Humans have frequented southern Africa’s highest reaches – Lesotho’s Maloti-Drakensberg Mountains – for =90,000 years. As with many high mountain systems worldwide, the Maloti-Drakensberg cast a rainshadow over closely neighboring arid lowlands (the eastern Karoo Desert). Based on previous archaeological and paleoenvironmental work in highland Lesotho, researchers have posited that source populations for human dispersals into the mountain zone often originated in the Karoo, particularly during phases of enhanced regional aridity or climatic instability. Lesotho’s mid/high-altitude temperate grasslands may have been attractive to lowland desert foragers because they offer topographical resource diversity and stable supplies of key resources. Such dynamics would have necessitated the existence and maintenance of strong cultural linkages between these ecologically contrasting macro-regions. To begin testing these hypotheses, we are conducting strontium isotope analyses of ostrich eggshell beads recovered from Sehonghong, a highland Lesotho rock shelter with a record of human occupation stretching from the late Holocene to early Marine Isotope Stage 3, and constructing terrestrial strontium isoscapes in both regions. This paper presents our preliminary results, which demonstrate the existence and persistence of highland-dryland exchange networks and hold implications for tracing the development of social strategies for long-term survival in the southern African interior.

Comparisons of PSJ with other historic samples indicate a similar caries prevalence as the Snake Hill Site (1812-1814) and Indian Wars sample (1870-1899), but a much lower rate than historic British, St. Peter’s, Fort Laurens, and Civil War samples. The conclusions drawn from the PSJ dental remains are better indicators of the overall health of the individuals than studies based on bony changes.","3019","Symposium","Presenter","Colleen_Milligan",3019,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-afternoon"

Consequently, our focus is on the types of bony changes seen rather than specific diagnoses of the etiology of those changes. A total of 240 (12%) bones of approximately 2,000 observable elements show changes in bone shape, bone loss, bone formation, trauma, non-specific infection, or joint disease. Among the elements displaying pathology, the highest prevalence involves bone formation (68%, 163/240) associated primarily with traumatic and degenerative processes. Although bone formation is also associated with shape changes and trauma, joint disease accounts for the majority of bone formation (60%, 97/163). Of the elements that demonstrate trauma, most (83%, 20/24) are appendicular elements.

For most of this time, the use of cadavers was neither ethical, nor legal. In U.S. medical study today, most cadavers come from body donation programs largely resulting from the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA), first proposed in 1968. The UAGA followed a change in social context of cadavers. It introduced the body as property and provided individuals the right to donate their body following death. Before the mid-1900s, the lack of legal avenues for the acquisition of cadavers led to the 18th century practice of grave robbing. In the U.S., “Resurrectionists” exhumed and sold recently buried bodies to anatomists. To stop grave robbing, anatomy acts were introduced in the late 18th/early 19th century. Governed at the state level, these laws outlined which bodies could be obtained legally for use as cadavers. Most laws allowed the bodies of criminals, suicides, indigent, or unclaimed individuals to be used as cadavers. The Point San Jose collection offers an opportunity to understand the social context of anatomy laws during the 19th century and identify those people used in anatomical studies.

Not merely shelters, dwellings often incorporate subtle aspects of social life and world view while being literally structured by the capacities of raw materials and construction techniques. Rather than a passive reflection of human intention or social existence, dwellings result from  making—to use Tim Ingold’s notion, a perspective placing “the maker from the outset as participant in a world of active materials” in which the maker intervenes “in worldly processes that are already going on and which give rise to the forms of the living world.” Methodologically, ‘making’ is “read longitudinally, as a confluence of forces and materials, rather than laterally, as a transposition from image to object.” Further, the transformations of ancient dwellings into archaeological features and contexts engage with additional modes of ‘making’ as houses become sites. I apply these concepts to two different classes of late prehispanic dwellings in coastal Peru—casas de quincha in the Casma Valley and tabique dwellings in the Tumbes Valley—and discuss analytical challenges involved in a comparative study of Andean houses and households.","3018","Symposium","Presenter","Jerry D._Moore",3018,1,9,"10","2.5",NA,"Symposium",2.5,"Th-afternoon"

Since people tend to clean activity areas, especially those that are used repeatedly, visible artifacts are rarely discovered in the context where they were originally used. Microartifact analysis focuses on the tiny fragments (<1 cm) of ceramics, bone, lithics, shell and other microartifacts that are produced as a result of human action. These tiny fragments are much more likely to remain in or near the context where they were originally produced because they are too small to be easily gathered and are often trampled into the soil matrixes of ancient surfaces. This study applies microartifactual sampling, processing and analytical techniques to characterize and compare the activities that took place on ancient surfaces at the site of Pampa la Cruz in Huanchaco, Peru. By examining the ubiquity of various microartifact categories per liter of excavated surface matrix, we isolate loci of food production, suggest which types of local and non-local foods were consumed, theorize about cooking practice and waste disposal, and examine traffic patterns in and around two Gallinazo structures.

Since 2010, I have been excavating multiple sites around Huanchaco bay, located in the littoral of the Moche Valley, North Coast of Peru. One particularity of this coastline is that there is still an active group of fishermen exploiting the sea resources using traditional technology. The continuity between the earliest occupation identified in this area (B.C. 1500-1200) and the present day fishermen is giving us a new perspective for exploring the social, economic and ideological trajectories of the Huanchaco community. In short, instead of framing archaeological occupations as Salinar or Moche, I propose a “Huanchaco identity” created over time by their economic and ideological relationship with the ocean.  To explore this possibility, I present the case of Pampa la Cruz, first occupied around B.C. 350/300 and abandoned roughly at 650/700 A.D. This occupation lasted for more than one thousand years in which this domestic settlement experienced several changes but also continuities in spatial organization and material culture. This paper presents the history of a fishing community and their co-existence with major social, political and ideological movements through time.

Large barrios consisting of SIAR architecture are found at the Chan Chan (the Chimu capital) and at all Chimu provincial centers throughout the empire.  Cerro la Virgen once lay in the rural hinterland of Chan Chan at the distal end of a vast system of state fields, which are believed to have supported royal activities at Chan Chan. At the site, well-preserved residential architecture covers 14 ha. We created a 3-D rendering of all the SAIR architecture at the site by processing aerial drone photography.  Recent SAIR excavations at the site were used to identify room types, which were then employed in a quantitative analysis of household and community spatial patterning.  As a result, we were able to identify household units, household clusters, and neighborhoods. Based on this study, we propose new quantitative methods for analyzing households, communities, and neighborhoods in the Andes and other regions.

Six hypothesized painting episodes were identified based on motif type and panel position. pXRF measurements were taken on 8 motifs and 3 rock surfaces. Multivariate statistical analyses showed no significant differences in the hypothesized groupings and, in 2 cases, between motifs and unpainted rock, suggesting that variations in paint thickness, weathering and rock coatings affected the elemental measurements. An experimental study was then conducted to evaluate the effect of paint thickness, confirming its significance in measured results.

Breath soul, when expressed in ritualized speech or song, was a powerful force engaged in both creation and maintenance of the cosmos. Graphic representations of breath soul and speech first appear in Mesoamerica during the Middle and Late Formative periods (900 to 100 BC) as volutes or scrolls issuing from the mouth of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures.

At first glance, the natural configuration of the coast seems to provide unobstructed passage, especially when compared with the rugged terrain of the adjacent highlands. The maps in many publications feature vague arrows marking trade or migration routes, giving the false impression that the coast was a broad unimpeded passageway. They generally omit details of topography and hydrography, and make no distinction among different parts of the coast. A closer look reveals important distinctions in the feasibility and comparative advantage of communication routes along the coastal piedmont, the coastal plain, and the Pacific littoral. The torrential rivers that cut across the coast posed important restrictions for east-west traffic, and in some cases, for north-south access from highland and piedmont sites to the coastal plain and littoral. In this talk, I will use ethnohistorical and geographic data to argue for finer assessment of coastal communication routes.

The Early Classic relationship between Kaminaljuyu and Teotihuacan has, in many ways, eclipsed the myriad other relationships evidenced by Kaminaljuyu’s material record during this time. The singular scholarly focus on the interaction between these two sites has created the impression that Early Classic Kaminaljuyu had a single, monolithic approach to foreign style and a single, primary foreign relationship. Stepping back to consider this time period more holistically, however, a pattern emerges instead of diachronic change and synchronic variation, with Kaminaljuyu laying claim to evolving sets of relationships with numerous foreign powers through time.

She noted, despite evidence from other places in the Southwest of increasing residential aggregation in PII, there seemed to be little evidence of this from the Mt Trumbull area. In this paper, we present evidence from two sites (Zip Code and Zip Code 2) suggesting a pre-aggregation phase in BMIII or PI times.   These sites are  interesting because, although they are quite large,  extensive sites, they appear to be early in age because pottery is almost entirely unpainted and non corrugated, projectile point styles also seem to pre-date PII, and radiocarbon and OSL dates suggest a BMIII or PI  age.

Doctoral students serve as course instructors while guiding master’s and undergraduate students as they instruct and engage with elementary pupils. Through team-teaching and interactive lesson planning, lectures and activities are developed specifically for young children, which are then made available to the public through an open access database. Assessments conducted throughout the semester gauge lesson effectiveness and indicate what concepts need to be revisited. As anthropology is rooted in the sciences and humanities, these classes convey cross-cutting concepts and encourage critical thinking at an early age.

Mules, horses or people pulled low and flat, four-wheeled wooden carts along these rails, which connected haciendas, ports, and remote jungle camps. These rails brought supplies from “civilization” or commodities out of the forest for distribution. This paper will explore the role that railroads played during this period. For the elites who ran commodity industries, Decauville rails were part of the modernizing infrastructure used to “tame” the jungle and speed up labor production. For the workers, the rails were laid atop stone roads built by their ancient ancestors, along jungle paths that their families had walked centuries, or through agricultural fields on lands formerly theirs. They were a tool used to exploit labor in a brutal process of forest and agricultural extraction for global commodity consumption, and a symbol of their loss of property rights, resources and the ability to feed their own families. And yet, in some cases, the rails that traversed into the forest allowed Maya workers to be away from the watchful eye of managers, hidden away in the untamable forest.

Several hundred residential houselots are with boundary walls enclosing areas of 1000-1500 square meters.

Looking more closely at Ucí as the proposed center for the micro-region during the Late Preclassic, we can assess the benefits and hindrances of regional integration. By using the concept of “disjuncture” we are able to contemplate the nature of the connections which linked the communities and how they varied within the region.","3005","Symposium","Presenter","Daniel_Vallejo-Caliz",3005,0,14,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-afternoon"

As Ek Balam faded in power, smaller communities in the vicinity became tethered to Chichen Itza in a variety of ways.

The architectural arrangement of Classic Xunantunich emphasizes a north/south directionality. The site’s sacbe, however, was constructed on an east/west alignment. This site plan emphasizes a cruciform pattern, which we argue was intentional, and may symbolically represent the axis mundi. In the west, the sacbe is associated with a marketplace and ballcourt. The openness of this area reflects public participation in economic and ritual activities. As the sacbe narrows towards the east, access becomes more restricted. The sacbe terminates at a hilltop group (Group D) where excavations revealed evidence for repetitive ritual activities. We argue that the Xunantunich sacbe may have served as a processional route for periodic rituals that would have reinforced the connection between economic and religious activities, while at the same time legitimized hierarchical relationships within the society.","3005","Symposium","Presenter","Bernadette_Cap",3005,0,14,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-afternoon"

While much of what we know of this economic system is provided by written records, the presence of large-scale marketplaces and currency can be traced into earlier periods using archaeological evidence. This evidence suggests that, in the Maya lowlands, both of these features began in the 7th century, as the rival kingdoms of Tikal and Calakmul attempted to consolidate and centralize their regional economies. These economic strategies increased the demand for currency commodities, reconfiguring economic relationships far beyond these two kingdoms. This paper will address the archaeological evidence for rapid changes along the San Pedro River in Northwestern Guatemala, an important trade route for cacao importation. Focusing on the site of La Florida, it will discuss the rapid rise of this kingdom, its establishment of economic and political relationships with distant partners, and its strategic control of the San Pedro trade route.

The means of finance—whether by surplus production, saving, assuming debt, sharing costs, or other mechanisms—depends on the particulars of the economy in question and can have systemic and long-term consequences for adopters. To show why finance matters in explanations of technological change and how archaeologists can study it, this paper presents a case of household saltmaking in the Basin of Mexico during the Aztec and Spanish empires. Saltmakers adopted several innovations in the manufacture of vessels they used to evaporate brine, but differences in how they financed these changes had divergent effects on the social relations of production. One set of innovations that reduced ceramic vessel production costs during the Late Postclassic correlates with a period of independence and stability among saltmaking households. However, Colonial-era saltmakers became dependent on wealthier investors for access to the means of production, most likely because they lacked the financial means to adopt an innovation involving metal cauldrons. This research shows the importance of considering finance in explanations of technological change as well as the study of domestic economies.","3004","Symposium","Presenter","John K._Millhauser",3004,1,13,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-afternoon"

This coinage, minted at Kilwa Kisiwani, was used only in a small region of the coast, and found at three towns (where they are plentiful in the archaeological record).

But David Graeber urges us to look deeper for sophisticated systems of value and material exchange in societies that have been traditionally considered to have primitive economies. His work also calls attention to the ways that debt, as a social and economic phenomenon, structures relationships and the juridical status of individuals. Reevaluating medieval Iceland with this lens, we see the disappearance of imported goods following the Viking Age not as evidence of a primitive subsistence economy but rather the development of an entrenched system of financial debt that had profound implications for the juridical and personal status of individuals as a failure to pay debts frequently resulted in the fracture of the family and household.","3004","Symposium","Presenter","Douglas_Bolender",3004,1,13,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-afternoon"

After the Roman conquest, the (at least partial) monetization of the local economy at Celtic settlements in Roman Mediterranean Gaul like Lattara significantly transformed notions of wealth and value, with a new interchangeability of wealth emerging.

Unlike the more rigid and historically ingrained materialization of social differentiation seen in the Late Classic, the material components of distinction during this time were more fluid, in general, and more ambiguous during and after this process of larger regional integration. The presence of possible extrahousehold feasting at a relatively isolated, larger domestic platform, an elite residence covered in stucco with iconography indicating governance and/or economic distinction, and various ceramic forms and aesthetic embellishments highlight emerging new materialities of differentiation.

Noted by John Stephens in 1841 as a large city with a deep water cave and gigantic pyramid, Xcoch is among a host of Puuc sites now dated to the Preclassic period. An interdisciplinary research program at Xcoch and vicinity from 2006 to 2013 revealed Preclassic Maya community patterns, megalithic architecture, and material culture for a developing complex society. Massive high building platforms, numerous stone pyramids and plazas, heavy stone habitation structures, and an internal site causeway connecting the large Gondola Aguada to the Xcoch grotto are among the many Preclassic settlement features extending across nearly 3 sq km. This paper examines Preclassic settlement patterns at Xcoch and its role as a regional center for the central Santa Elena plain and the greater Puuc region. Other Preclassic sites show mounting evidence for early megalithic architecture and formative ceramics  supporting the presence of a multi-tiered hierarchy within Xcoch's immediate settlement orbit.

Since then, similar wares have been recovered from Preclassic contexts at a number of other sites. Although Brainerd originally described Yotholin as an Early Preclassic type, other archaeologists have attributed it to the late Middle Preclassic. In this paper, we will revisit the contextual evidence surrounding Yotholin and discuss it in light of our work in the Puuc and recent reevaluation of Middle Preclassic ceramics in general. This reanalysis suggests that Brainerd’s initial interpretation of Yotholin was correct and that it is contemporaneous with and/or slightly predates early Middle Preclassic Ek phase ceramics (900-700 BC). It is possible that Yotholin represents the earliest pottery yet identified in the Northern Lowlands. We examine the implications this would have for understanding the origins of the Maya in this region.

How can this power be release or lost? There are many ways in which a building can be imbued with certain attributes that allow expressing and regulating unequal power relations. Along with the form and style of buildings, ritual is perhaps one of the most important means. Through ritual performance, actors imbue the building with the ch'ulel, ensouling and animating it; obliged the ch'ulel to leave the building, killing the animate construction, and make it possible for the ch'ulel to reborn, favoring it to become more powerful. In the  lowlands, the performance of rituals that had as purpose to animate, kill or make reborn buildings is a long-standing tradition that dates back to the Middle Preclassic period. This paper focuses on Structure 1714-Asub of Xaman Susula, a public building interpreted as architecture of power, precursor of the Classic palaces that had administrative and ritual functions but lacked domestic functions of palaces. During the archaeological explorations, we found material remains of ritual behavior that indicates that Structure 1714-Asub was alive and powerful.

On the one hand, this data provides an outlet to better explore the large scale social processes impacting the early macro-region of the Maya area. However, material analysis of recovered shell, lithic, and ceramic artifacts assisted by stratigraphic context has revealed that many of the regional characteristics of later periods, such as shared religious practices, systems of material value, and networks of exchange were much more distinct at the local level than anticipated in the earliest investigated contexts. As a result, the data make it clear that as time progressed from 900 to 350 BC, while Yaxuná underwent urbanizing processes, the presence of material objects increased while the selection of those materials gradually became focused on more fixed sources. In the same way, the previously recognized diversity of material objects became increasingly limited.

The Yalahau region is defined physiographically by freshwater wetlands (sabanas), which stand in stark contrast the rest of the Northern Lowlands. These wetlands were utilized by Preclassic inhabitants of the region for agricultural purposes and helped support a dense Preclassic population. The wetlands are framed to the north by the Yalahau Lagoon and Holbox Island. Research by Proyecto Costa Escondida members have revealed the dynamic nature of the coastline during the Preclassic period and there seems to be a correlation between the changing nature of the coastline with the utility of the inland freshwater wetlands for the region’s inhabitants.

Several of these vessels contained large greenstone axes and basalt, while another contained a perforated greenstone plaque.

To generate this data, the Institute of Archaeology developed the Longwood Vulnerability, Potential, and Condition (VPC) Assessment method and applied it to the Hurricane Sandy Shoreline Survey in Lancaster, Northumberland, Middlesex and Mathews Counties.  By triangulating the data from site vulnerability to quantify annual shoreline change rates, potential for undocumented resources through predictive modeling of the study area and the observed condition of known sites, the Longwood VPC Assessment method provides resource managers with a powerful tool for making informed, data-driven management decisions about archaeological sites and the level of threat to which each may be subjected.","3000","Symposium","Presenter","Mary_Farrell",3000,0,8,"8","2",NA,"Symposium",2,"Th-afternoon"

Previous archaeological surveys of Block Island concluded that a high frequency, density, and complexity of Woodland (2700 – 400 years before present (B.P.) and Contact Period (400 – 350 B.P.) archaeological sites located on landforms immediately adjacent to the interior salt ponds with far fewer, and much less complex sites located on the bluffs along the seaward coastline.  Larger and more complex permanent and semi-permanent village sites were believed to be located almost exclusively along the salt ponds with smaller temporary and task specific sites associated with freshwater swamps and ponds throughout the interior and near coastal areas of the island. The identification of several large seaward Woodland and Contact Period coastal sites suggest a much more complex settlement pattern than previously believed. These sites are believed to represent spring fishing camps, indicating that earlier reconstructions of Native settlement patterns on Block Island need to be revised.

Examining marginal and non-marginal sites through a zooarchaeological lens can help decipher patterns of resource use which can act as a proxy for understanding environmental and social change. Current work on Hegranes has shown that the archaeofaunal assemblages from marginal sites are nearly always comprised of over 50% wild resources throughout the site’s short occupational history, while those from proper farms are dominated by domesticates. These marginal sites also follow a pattern of abandonment by the year 1104 A.D., while many of the larger farms are still functioning to the present.

The settlement of the island two centuries earlier set off cascading environmental and landscape changes whose agricultural consequences were now evident, including deforestation, erosion, and wetland alteration. Meanwhile, the rise of a wealthy landowning class altered the economic basis of society from primarily household production towards more centralized structures of rent extraction and tenancy. On Hegranes, a region in Skagafjörður, North Iceland, numerous small settlements on the margins of modern farm properties were abandoned during the 11th century. These sites are in localized areas of deep, dry soils between eroded bedrock and wetland, and while some may represent independent households, others likely served specialized functions in the service of larger farmsteads. After the sites ceased to be inhabited, they were used sporadically for livestock management over the next eight centuries. This rapid reorganization of settlement patterns and landscape use reflects simultaneous and interconnected transformations in ecological and social practice. This paper explores how the changing practices of marginal households both contributed and responded to this moment of transformation, as environmental and political factors came together to alter the material ways in which social inequality was organized and maintained.","2999","Symposium","Presenter","Kathryn_Catlin",2999,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Th-afternoon"

After the collapse, the Maya lowlands were massively de-populated, but during the Late Postclassic (AD 1200-1600) Lake Mensabak became a place of renewed settlement. As Maya migrated to the lake for its aquatic resources and defensible landscape, elites chose islands with elevated terrain to instantiate a cosmological/ideological scheme.

This newly untethered and mobile lower class searched for avenues for wealth creation previously unavailable. One avenue, in the century following Iceland’s Black Death, was through fishing and fish exports. During this period, previously tightly restricted fish exports flourished in trade between European merchants and numerous fishing and trading sites around Iceland’s coast. The 15th century fishing station of Gufuskálar on the northern coast of Iceland’s Snæfellsnes peninsula demonstrates large and anomalous concentrations of wealth and European trade goods. The site also has evidence of increasingly specialized marine resource utilization. Whether Gufuskálar’s resident fishermen were Icelandic or European, it is likely that this concentration of wealth was only possible through the temporary breakdown in Icelandic social hierarchy. Based on the zooarchaeological and preliminary artifactual data, this paper explores how social upheaval following Iceland’s Black Death is connected to intensive preindustrial fishing and a late medieval European dependence on Icelandic marine resources.","2999","Symposium","Presenter","Sant Mukh_Khalsa",2999,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Th-afternoon"

Most of the research on the Dissolution focuses on how the new landowners reused the land, or converted churches into manor houses. However, people who lacked the means and resources to make large-scale changes to the former monasteries still found a way to express their new relationship through removing and reusing the stone in the farms and villages near the monastery. At Thornton Abbey, multiple agricultural and village properties were surveyed for monastic stone. The stone was reused as building material, garden decorations, and, more recently, as gifts. How the stone is used appears dependent on the variety and the age of the property, indicating that the stone was interpreted in different ways based on the individuals and their social context.

Investigations at Stekkjarborg on the farm of Keldudalur in Hegranes, Northern Iceland discovered the remnants of a small-scale iron smelting site dating to post-1104, well after deforestation. The smelting site represents a specific small-scale production activity being conducted in a marginal area for domestic use.

The island's role in trade involved the production of low-cost bulk goods destined for markets mostly via Denmark into the 19th century. The focal area of this paper, the rural and upland Mývatn region, was in some ways socially and ecologically marginal even within Iceland. The growing environment was affected by unpredictable cold weather while volatile erosion zones hemmed local grazing land and hayfields. Although the community was home to two small rural municipal centers, it was distant from coastal trading points. Through interdisciplinary archaeology, environmental investigation, and documentary evidence, this paper investigates and describes how people in Mývatn managed ecological productivity and economic engagement at a periphery. We find that their significant efforts to secure abundance from marginal places was inseparable from social transformations through which the community ultimately assumed an influential role in changing the conditions of regional and national trade. This integrated social and ecological approach contributes to understandings of marginality as not an essential property of landscapes and societies, but one that is actively produced and contested through relations at many scales.","2999","Symposium","Presenter","Megan_Hicks",2999,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Th-afternoon"

The initial coastal-focused settlement of the region was followed by the founding of new farms in the deep interior.  Most were not sustained and some farm sites on the coast were also reduced. Initially, the magnate’s farm of Svalbarð had a herding economy supplemented by fishing while Hjálmarsvík, its coastal neighbor, exploited a diversity of marine resources. Around AD 1300 Svalbarð became the chief consumer of the region’s marine resources and Hjálmarsvík become a more specialized sheep-herding farm resembling other small farms. While this switch occurred during a period in which wool production was on the increase in Iceland, it also corresponds to a phase of climatic cooling. New geoarchaeological and remote sensing data provide a means of resolving the roles of these trends on the Svalbarð estate.

Widespread restructuring of labor or social organization can be brought to light by focusing on the moments in which such change takes place, along with accompanying transformations in the way social inequality manifests. Those on the margins--whether environmentally, socially, politically, spiritually, or otherwise--are often at the crux of these moments.

We examine the spatial organization (e.g. architecture, activities), the production and consumption of goods (e.g. ceramics, lithics and faunal remains), in order to reconstruct the daily life at this early urban site, discussing the social, economical and spatial systems of households, and their role in the urban community structure.","2997","Symposium","Presenter","Marion_Forest",2997,0,14,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-afternoon"

Our study uses qualitative optical petrography and geochemical analysis (NAA) to evaluate the tempers and paste recipes in ceramic fragments and raw clays from Angamuco, located in the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin, Michoacán. Angamuco was occupied before and throughout the development of the Purépecha Empire (1350-1530 CE) and is thus an important case study for understanding the impacts of political change on urban landscapes. Angamuco appears to have been relatively self-sufficient in pottery production, beginning in the Classic and through the Postclassic, including during imperial incorporation. While we did identify some temporal and spatial variation in ceramic production and consumption, pottery technologies and techniques of manufacture appear to have remained relatively stable over long periods of time. Our data point to multiple small-scale producers, who focused on local clays and tempers, generating numerous, complex paste recipes. The results of this analysis contribute to our understanding of ceramic production processes at Angamuco and may be compared to provenance studies in Western Mexico and elsewhere.

The Late Glacial and early Holocene landscapes of this region were dynamic with considerable ecological restructuring. Aeolian deposits accumulated in lowland areas and adjacent foothills at relatively high rates, soils were relatively underdeveloped, river down-cutting prevailed across the valley, and wild fires were common. These disturbance regimes and periods of landscape instability fostered a wide expanse of early- to mid-successional mixed vegetation communities that included herbaceous tundra, shrubs and deciduous trees, key habitats for large grazers and browsers that were significant resources for early hunter-gatherer populations.

Major environmental transitions occurred in the region as the Holocene climate warmed and effective moisture increased, including the spread of boreal forests and peat lands, an expansion of lake development, and intensified landscape stability. These transitions introduced changes to the extent of habitat and seasonal availability of mammal and aquatic food resources. We discuss broad human responses to these environmental shifts in this region from the late Pleistocene through the later Holocene.

Prior alluvial stratigraphy studies concluded that arroyo formation near these settlements occurred two centuries after this exodus and therefore was not a contributing factor. The present study used a larger sample of radiocarbon dates, including short-lived, charred plant material from alluvial contexts and tree-rings from several deeply buried juniper trees preserved at the base of paleoarroyo fills, to refine the dating of late prehistoric channel entrenchment in the Zuni Salt Lake area. Bayesian age modeling that included juniper germination dates determined by radiocarbon wiggle matching facilitated construction of a high-resolution alluvial chronology. The revised chronology includes an arroyo-cutting episode constrained to the 60-year interval between AD 1106 and 1166. This finding suggests that terminal Pueblo II depopulation of the Zuni Salt Lake area ~AD1130 probably did in fact coincide with extensive arroyo formation. This landscape degradation greatly reduced the area’s agricultural potential and arguably played a significant role in its mid-12th century depopulation.","2996","Symposium","Presenter","Jill_Onken",2996,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-afternoon"

The award is made possible through the generosity of the family of the late Roald Fryxell, a geologist whose career exemplified the crucial role of multidisciplinary cooperation in archaeology. The 2018 Fryxell Award recognizes a scholar who has made significant contributions in the application of earth sciences to archaeology. It is fitting that Vance T. Holliday is the recipient, for few figures have in the last four decades been as prominent or prolific in contributing to North American geoarchaeology. Although best known for his meticulous stratigraphic and soil geomorphic work at Paleoindian sites on the High Plains, Holliday’s substantive and methodological contributions span continents, and a range of Quaternary geological, geochronological, and archaeological settings, questions, and even a few controversies.

The capac ñan from Chachapoyas to Moyobamba was used for centuries before another road was built for driving traffic and latest with the  Marginal further on to Tarapoto. The capac ñan was used by the Incas in their conquest of Moyobamba and later to be used by the many Spanish campaigns in their search for Eldorado. This important highland/lowland route crossing the cordillera and continuing into the Ceja de Selva gave access to coveted resources from both sides but also facilitated war parties to attack the highlanders. During our investigations in recent years, we have located the ancient trail which was stone paved for long stretches and found documents in the archives showing the existence of hitherto unknown tribes that lived along the river systems up to the end of the 17th century.

Recent research, however, reveals significant environmental and cultural diversity and calls into question whether “Chachapoyas” can meaningfully be understood as a single region.  There is little evidence for any practices that both unified it internally while distinguishing it from others, and ongoing research at the site complex of Tambillo in comparison with other areas of Chachapoyas indicates that the most productive approach at this stage is to focus on characterizing social and cultural patterns at the local level.  Determining how, or whether, higher-order sociocultural units were constituted at the regional level requires greater bodies of data than those currently available.  In this situation, it is both analytically productive and potentially more accurate to understand all interactions as inter-regional, even among groups that were once considered to belong to the same “region.”  Similar geographical and environmental conditions found in many parts of the Eastern Andes suggest that it is important to more broadly evaluate the importance of scale and landscape in characterizing inter-group interactions, and to reconsider models developed from coastal and highland contexts.","2994","Symposium","Presenter","Anna_Guengerich",2994,0,15,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Th-afternoon"

The forests collectively represent a global biodiversity hotspot, with many unique species.

The steep environmental gradients create dispersal barriers to plants and animals, resulting in highly restricted distributions. Along the >3000 m altitudinal gradient, there are zones where cooling air can form persistent fogs, leading to cloud forests that have moisture-dependent species and low stature trees, which nevertheless provide important ecosystem services. The relatively cool temperatures and steep slopes at higher elevations often discourage human colonization, but some sites include archaeological sites, suggesting that current land use may not be prescriptive of the past. Nonexclusive factors may include past climate change, enclaves with drier microenvironments, transhumance, and use of multiple ecological zones.

Based on stratigraphy, radiocarbon dates, material culture, and architecture, Wimba went through both periods of local development and periods of involvement in regional interaction networks in the Late Intermediate Period (1000-1450 CE). The site is located along strategic pathways between the highland Chacha and eastern lowlands, and it includes diverse structures and open spaces that hosted communal gatherings. Excavation results show a long-term occupation that includes at least three phases of architectural construction. Recovered materials indicate that intra-regional exchange networks were most prevalent until the final occupation, when the impact of highland groups was felt. This paper argues that communal gatherings functioned as centrifugal forces in interaction networks, and most importantly helped “emplace” a regional network that incorporated multiple nearby ecological regions.","2994","Symposium","Presenter","Brian_McCray",2994,0,15,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Th-afternoon"

This new east-west network overlay, but did not replace north-south interaction that persisted throughout the latter centuries of the sequence.

By the subsequent Ingatambo phase (800 - 550 B.C.), the number of ceremonial centers in the valley decreased despite the florescence of monumentality at the site of Ingatambo and the increase presence of foreign pottery and other exotic materials.

Similarities in material patterning from Ecuador to Bolivia suggest that autonomous ceja de selva societies were integrated within long distance intraregional interaction networks which potentially impacted local cultural change. These networks were oriented around rivers such as the Marañón and Huallaga which facilitated the movement of people, resources, and ideas. Unfortunately, understanding these relationships has often been hindered by models that emphasize highland or lowland developments, and either ignore the ceja, or treat it as a transitional environment exploited for resources.  By analyzing ceja de selva societies as autochthonous and linked by intraregional and interregional interaction, this symposium aims to better understand ceja de selva cultural developments and their participating roles in the rise of Andean Civilization.","2994","Symposium","Chair (Primary)","Ryan_Clasby",2994,0,15,"15","3.75",NA,"Symposium",3.75,"Th-afternoon"

With its large-scale ports and massive warehouses, the Roman empire easily fits this bill. Models of socio-political evolution, however, not only build on top-down templates of power, but also adopt a view of things (i.e. stored goods) as passive resources. But in the light of recent material culture theory, storage becomes a more complex mediation of time and matter than the ‘surplus model’ could fathom, with power emerging from localized mediations of assemblages of humans and things, although with historical implications that were no less far-reaching. 

This paper empirically traces the temporal and material choreographies of storage practices at Ostia and Portus, the main ports of the city of Rome. It investigates how things’ trajectories through these ports and their warehouses articulated control and calculability, and it traces the resulting landscape of power. In so doing, it challenges old readings of an opposition between state control and private interests at these centres, and instead proposes a kaleidoscopic model of power, rooted in the material and metaphorical assemblage of the family.","2992","Symposium","Presenter","Astrid_Van Oyen",2992,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-afternoon"

In this paper I draw on such approaches to rethink anarchism as a particular mode of human-thing relations, rather than as an ideological stance or political philosophy. As a case study, I will examine a set of village communities of the Andean Late Intermediate Period (c.1000-1450) who resided on the heavily forested eastern piedmont to the northwest of Cuzco. Drawing on two seasons of excavation data, I will show how these settlements were founded by people who were attempting to flee the Inka Empire and all it represented.

This explicitly multi-scalar approach demonstrates how the entanglements between power, agents, and things reverberated throughout Romano-Egyptian society.

In this it differed little from the early empires that have long held archaeology’s attention. But unlike its precursors, the U.S.S.R. was guided by a political ideology premised vigorously on the relationship between humans and things—between labor, the non-human inputs of production, and property. Imperial sovereignty rested on profound material dependencies that stitched the multiethnic “federation” together, while the individual Soviet subject was forged out of the proverbial hammer and sickle. As with all empires, the promised utopia never arrived, and the Marxist-Leninist “mattering” of politics came at a terrible human and environmental cost. The doom of this bold endeavor is palpable today in the physical ruins of Soviet socialism, which haunt the archaeological record of the contemporary past across Eurasia. Based on preliminary survey, ethnography, and archival research, this paper represents a foray into Soviet materiality and its afterlife, taking as its touchstone the former Soviet republic of Armenia and the industrial ruins that litter its urban and rural landscapes.

One tenet of French colonial policy was to govern through the operation of commerce, specifically through the infrastructure of cash-cropping. If peanut agriculture would, in principle, create both wealth for the colony and ‘African subjects,’ on the ground, peanuts combined with a web of material entities that bent, diverted, or interrupted the flow of imperial power: traditions of community-making; collective attachments to land, self-sufficiency, and ancestral influence; and cultural economies of objects, all of which had long shapeshifted to the beat of broader historical forces. These mixtures of imperial and vernacular materialities -- and the fields of agency they set in motion – find expression in the artifact assemblages of village vestiges occupied between 1800 and 1960. Tracing shifts in consumption practices during that period, I reflect on the fraught, ambiguous process of colonial rule, whose effects were chronically interrupted, twisted, or evaded by Siin villagers; at the same time, colonial commerce also gradually wove peasants into a web of dependencies – on markets and the state, primarily – whose strains are still felt in rural Senegal today.","2992","Symposium","Presenter","Francois_Richard",2992,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-afternoon"

Two answers to this question have received much attention: that empires promote ideologies that support cohesion among colonizers, and that coercion and violence can promote the expansion of empires. I propose a third answer, in which colonizers create varied material forms that may challenge the goals of empire, but later appeal to the king for regulation and control over the material world. To study this proposition, I use the example of coins among Spanish colonizers in Mexico City. Colonizers invented and used a variety of coins, in part by diluting gold into different alloys to make up for the scarcity of gold that they found in the colonies. Thus, they challenged imperial authority by creating new ways of measuring value and wealth (in this case, by creating more wealth with diluted gold). But when they found that their new coins created problems of conversion and exchange, they appealed to the crown requesting regulations over the minting, value, and use of different coins, thereby strengthening imperial authority.","2992","Symposium","Presenter","Enrique_Rodriguez",2992,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-afternoon"

Fancy Tiahuanaco-style pottery, used in life, during the burial ceremony, and accompanying the deceased in their tombs, helped to underline or maybe even create ties with the larger Tiahuanaco polity.

Because an anthropocentric viewpoint begins with water as a matter of control, water appears as an object existing independently of the wider physical phenomenon. However, if archaeologists are to approach imperial projects as involving new ways of perceiving difference, this paper argues that water presents a contentious form at the intersection of frontier ecologies.

In this paper, we turn to the ethnographic record as a lens to explore how specific motifs and sites from two locations in northern Australia (western Arnhem Land’s Wellington Range, and the Sir Edward Pellew Islands in the southwest Gulf of Carpentaria) are embedded in complex social and cultural networks for Australia’s ‘saltwater people’. At the core of our argument is the need to recognize how aspects of the ethnographic record such as song, kinship, cosmology and memory can play a pivotal role in accessing the meaning and symbolism of ‘saltwater’ rock art as well as how these images encode or communicate information about people’s social identities.

","Other","Digital Archaeology","Mobility","In early stages of archaeologists working with island biographies water was viewed as a dividing force, creating a barrier between communities. Lately, many have agreed that this is too simplistic a view and now see water as a binding force that allows for communities to connect across channels separating continents from islands or islands from their neighbors. In fact, the sea itself is a container for interactions between seafarers, who likely ate, slept, and communicated details of their journey to one another. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to trace the exact routes used by past navigators. Using least cost pathway analysis, I applied an isochrone method to analyze water-based travel corridors as canoe routes through the Caribbean to suggest possible route trajectories between sites connected through the movement of materials. Alongside evidence from experimental canoe voyages that speak to the physical relationship between voyager and voyage, these routes can place seafaring on the map. It is possible to draw attention to the relationship between canoer, travel corridor, and inter-island relationships by highlighting water as a connecting force within the lives of Amerindian canoers before 1492.","2989","Symposium","Presenter","Emma_Slayton",2989,1,9,"10","2.5",NA,"Symposium",2.5,"Th-afternoon"

","Iron Age","Archaeometry & Materials Analysis: Metallurgical Analysis","Material Culture and Technology","In the study of technological transformations, there is often much discussion of how innovations are conditioned by earlier systems of technical knowledge. Identification of transitional features is often challenging, however, particularly for questions about the origins of iron smelting and its relationship with copper-base metallurgy. This paper discusses some unusual technological features in iron metallurgical debris (circa 8th-6th c. BC) from a fortified hilltop site in the Caucasus, shedding light on the early development of iron technology. Macroscopically and microscopically, the slags are in most respects classic iron smithing slags. Larger fragments show the classic planoconvex shape of smithing hearth bottoms, and the slag microsctructures are dominated by wüstite (FeO) and small particles of metallic iron. However, analysis of metal inclusions trapped within these slags shows that they contain small amounts of copper and arsenic. These results suggest that the iron forged in this workshop was smelted from the oxidized upper zone (gossan) of a copper-bearing polymetallic deposit. If so, this would provide the first direct evidence of a much-discussed theory that iron smelting emerged from experimentation with copper ore deposits, linking the invention of iron with earlier copper-base metallurgical traditions.","2987","Symposium","Presenter","Nathaniel_Erb-Satullo",2987,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-afternoon"

We combine pXRF-derived geochemical analyses of copper slag with formal social network analytical methods (SNA). We use pXRF data to determine technological strategies employed by metal producing communities. We then compare geochemical data between sites to elucidate dynamics of inter-site relations. Combining site-centered data with regional survey data enables multi-scalar analysis that provides a novel view of ancient metal producing societies.","2987","Symposium","Presenter","Ioana_Dumitru",2987,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-afternoon"

","Paleolithic","Geoarchaeology","Material Culture and Technology","A number of different direct and indirect proxies are used to identify fire at archaeological sites. We propose a new organic molecular proxy for identification of anthropogenic fire in archaeological sediments, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These molecules are a byproduct of the incomplete combustion of organic biomass, and are preserved well on deep time scales. We applied this proxy to Lusakert Cave, a Middle Paleolithic site in the Hrazdan Gorge, Armenia. From these same samples, we also extracted n-alkanes, the molecular remains of the epicuticular waxes of terrestrial plants. We analyzed the dD and d13C values of the n-alkanes to measure vegetation and hydrological changes at the site during its occupation. This coupled record of climate and fire from sediments containing archaeological material gives insight into the ability of Middle Palaeolithic hominins to control fire through changing ecological regimes.","2987","Symposium","Presenter","Alexander_Brittingham",2987,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-afternoon"

Toolmaking, though, has since been observed in not only other primates but also birds, otters, and octopi, among others. Making fire, however, remains an exclusively human skill. Much of our technology can be conceptualized in terms of the control of fire: pyrotechnology. Until recently in human history, the development of new technologies and materials depended on people attaining and controlling greater and greater temperatures. This process began more than one million years ago as the emergence and spread of our species depended on fire for warmth, cooking, and protection. Later we used fire to treat stone and wood implements and to create adhesives to join them together as compound tools. Baked clay eventually followed, as did ceramics, metals, faience, glass, and other substances upon which civilization was built. Additionally, fire is cross-culturally used ceremonially, and it is ascribed a variety of symbolic meanings. This session, organized by the Yale Initiative for the Study of Ancient Pyrotechnology, considers how our increasingly sophisticated control of fire, as evidenced in the archaeological record and in material culture, sparked behavioral, cultural, and societal complexity around the world.","2987","Symposium","Chair (Primary)","Ellery_Frahm",2987,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-afternoon"

While some have argued for dietary continuity throughout the regional Woodland, others maintain that certain specific resources—including fish, wild starchy plants, and/or maize—were more intensively exploited over time.  The Cloudman site (20CH6), located on an island off Michigan’s Upper Peninsula in Lake Huron, is a multicomponent occupation spanning the Middle through late Late Woodland periods. The ceramic assemblage is therefore ideal for assessing dietary and technological change through time. Functional pottery analysis (of technical properties and use-alterations traces), stylistic pottery analysis, microbotanical analysis, absorbed lipid residue analysis, stable isotope analysis, and AMS dating are used in tandem to construct a chronological sequence of diet, cooking habits, and cooking technology and the relationships between them.

There is much diversity in tool use: hide working, butchery (meat/fish), impact, antler/bone working, wood working, and plant working. Various patterns were detected between tool use and tool technology. Many of the numerous microliths, showed impact damage, but are attributed to fishing rather than hunting. This conforms to the riverside location of the site on the River Eden. Hide working was primarily limited to dry hide, which supports the hypothesis that hunting was not the primary procurement activity and is also suggestive of a residential site, which is further supported by the diverse set of tools and wide range of activities represented.

We use evidence from the site of Baking Pot as a case study to test multiple hypotheses for the formation of these deposits and to illustrate the utility of the combined use of Bayesian radiocarbon chronologies, calendrical dates of hieroglyphic texts, and artifact proportions to better understand the timing and artifactual composition of each feature. Finally, we discuss the temporal and depositional differences between multiple peri-abandonment deposits at Baking Pot and contrast these data with radiocarbon evidence for political and demographic decline at the site and across the broader Belize River Valley.","2980","Electronic Symposium","Presenter","Julie_Hoggarth",2980,0,14,"14","3.5",NA,"Electronic Symposium",3.5,"Th-afternoon"

This behavioral-contextual approach examines the vertical and horizontal architectural contexts of artifacts, the relative completeness of vessels, and the represented vessel forms in order to better understand on-floor assemblages. This method accounts for mundane and ceremonial abandonments of gradual and catastrophic nature, along with abandonment with anticipated return. The proposed method is framed in a visual model built on archaeological case-studies from across the Maya world. Most of the featured examples correspond to residential architecture, but this model should be applicable to other types of buildings. While it is far from exact, the interpretational framework that we propose allows to explain the variability of documented abandonment contexts and promises the avoidance of such equivocal terms as “problematical deposits”.","2980","Electronic Symposium","Presenter","Andrew_Snetsinger",2980,0,14,"14","3.5",NA,"Electronic Symposium",3.5,"Th-afternoon"

Remains of a large deposit of Terminal Classic materials were recovered from a corner of the palace’s primary courtyard. Based on its location on the courtyard surface and below collapse, the deposit was assumed to date to the period of the palace’s abandonment. The placement of this deposit was contemporary with Actuncan’s 9th-century renaissance as a post-royal capital after centuries of incorporation into polities ruled by kings located at nearby Classic period centers. Mixter and colleagues have argued that Actuncan’s palace served as a noble’s residence during the Classic period and was terminated during the Terminal Classic because of its symbolic association with external forces that had previously dominated the site. Drawing on new ceramic analysis, this paper looks in detail at the contents and context of the deposit to reassess the significance of the abandoned palace to Actuncan’s thriving Terminal Classic community.

The deposits date to the period of the depopulation and abandonment of the community and are interpreted as terminal deconsecratory acts by the community’s final residents. Most terminal deposits were placed on final structure floors and covered by collapse debris that accumulated through time. One unique terminal deposit, on the final structure floors of a diviner’s room, was carefully buried in a lens of fine sascab suggesting that special care and attention was taken to “bury” the terminal deposits in this room.

Faculty and students involved in this project are conducting path-breaking archaeological research covering more than 10,000 years of culture and architecture in Cyprus, Greece, Egypt, Ethiopia, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, and Turkey. Our aim is to link UC labs, libraries and museums to form a highly-networked collaborative platform for curation, analysis, and visualization of 3D archaeological heritage data.

Digital Data and Threatened Cultural Heritage","Worldwide","Other","Digital Archaeology","Cultural Heritage and Preservation","In his influential book “To Save Everything, Click Here” (2014), Evgeny Morozov coined the term “solutionism” to describe a utopian vision that innovation in digital technologies can solve complex social problems. Fueled by Silicon Valley wealth, digital technologies have an obvious glamor. The high-profile reconstruction of the Palmyra Arch by the Institute for Digital Archaeology exemplifies how governments, universities, corporate sponsors, and granting foundations use media attention on threatened world heritage to showcase technological prowess. Do such efforts meaningfully preserve threatened heritage? Do they overshadow often tragic social realities that fuel war and other causes of heritage destruction? How likely are the data to be available, discoverable, and of any future use?

To move beyond solutionism, this paper highlights how digital data need better contextualization. Context is multi-dimensional-- simultaneously physical, social, and intellectual. Contextualization requires developing “human capital” through community archaeology and public education, and sustained institutional commitments for digital curation. Such efforts cannot be siloed institutionally, intellectually, or technologically. Open Context (http://opencontext.org) illustrates approaches to link and integrate heritage data across institutional and community boundaries in ways that can encourage continued development of the human capital needed to make digital cultural heritage a meaningful aspect of preservation.

This secondary impact of climate change threatens sites outside of the immediate zone of flooding and erosion. Given the importance of cultural heritage sites to descendent communities, and their preservation of paleoclimatic and environmental records in association with the record of human settlements over millennia, it is imperative that we develop standard methods for assessing destruction risk of archaeological sites within a climate change framework. Using Casco Bay area in Maine as a pilot study, this study develops a methodology for integrating decadal-to-centennial climate change projections, socio-economic and demographic data, and state and federal land use and cultural resource management regulations to create a robust, user-friendly risk assessment framework.

This created a unique form of “archaeological TEK” (Traditional Ecological Knowledge) that represents an invaluable guide into the changing preservation conditions since late 19th century.

Between 2005-2017 we conducted extensive coring surveys of over 100 Norse middens, and open area and small test excavations at over 15 sites.  The results show a shocking and almost complete loss of once outstanding organic preservation in a region where only 60 years ago wood, bones, leather, wool, and feathers were recovered. Our findings draw attention to the destructive process of the modern climate change that has been affecting the organic preservation conditions for at least 60 years, and to the need to organize a circumpolar-wide, international response strategy to rescue the endangered sites and their unique cultural heritage before it is too late.

Professional codes of ethics provide an insufficient framework for responding to these questions, resulting in inadvertent entrenchment that limits the scope of potential hypotheses and epistemic growth and overlooks the power of counter-narratives. The archaeology of historic cemeteries is uniquely placed for social engagement. We propose a redefinition of “ethics” that encompasses syncretism between divergent modern communities and judicious excavation. Building on the work of W.E.B. Du Bois and Alison Wylie, we seek to embrace a multiple consciousness as a component of an evolving practice.

Controversy surrounds interpretations, owing to incongruities between archaeological and textual data as well as disagreements over how to weight the disparate observations made in these documents. Modern researchers variably evaluate the biases, motives, and the overall truthfulness of the authors of these documents. Another issue is the general subjectivity involved in fitting non-systematic observations into pre-existing anthropological models; usually some support can be found for almost any position. This presentation will attempt to address some of these issues by applying a formulaic approach to the weighting of document subject matter. While there is still subjectivity involved in the method, it provides a consistent and replicable means of evaluating the importance of different themes in a text. These themes can then be interpreted to infer both biases of the author and the relative significance of observations regarding Indigenous social organization. A trial attempt at this approach supports many pre-existing interpretations but also suggests some of the topics previously identified as paramount in the social organization of Contact era Sonora are of secondary importance.

Was this movement out of the Chama the continuation of a centuries-long process of Pueblo coalescence, or rather a response to early Spanish contact and colonization? The latter idea is bolstered by the fact that the Chama is the ancestral homeland of Ohkay Owingeh where Governor Oñate established the first capitol of New Mexico in 1598.

Ethical anthropologists in North America recognize that they need to secure tribal/First Nations permission for their research.  Sometimes permission is granted only for projects of interest to the tribes themselves. And sometimes publication of that research for a wider audience may be restricted or denied. But the benefits of collaboration result in a much richer understanding of Native and non-Native relations, one informed and shaped by the perspectives of Native people themselves.
 The Hopi Tribe of Arizona has been insisting on such collaboration for decades now. Nonetheless, some scholars working on the Hopi people continue to ignore such ethical guidelines and understandings.  We argue that Southwestern archaeology, cultural anthropology, and ethnohistory will never progress beyond the limitations of Western epistemologies and lines of evidence biased by Western ethnocentrism and silences until collaboration is embraced and institutionalized as the only ethical and productive way to understand our shared pasts and presents. We discuss Moquis and Kastiilam: The Hopi History Project as one example of such collaboration.

For the colonial period in Sonora, historians and anthropologists have mostly relied upon archival documents written by representatives of the Spanish empire, in addition to information from historical archaeology. The Comcaac knowledge immersed in oral traditions balances some of the inherent biases in the Spanish documentary record, and sheds light on aspects of their history where the documents are mute. Initially we describe Comcaac historical accounts about the “Cazoopin” (Spaniards) that mention first encounters with Spanish sailing ships and their opportunistic adoption of Spanish material culture. We then discuss the relevance of place and routes among the different historical narratives. To finalize with a discussion on how, both Comcaac oral accounts and the documentary record, provide ample descriptions of leaders. It is argued that the importance of Comcaac masculine war leaders is a cultural practice similar in some respects to Spanish and Western emphases on prominent individuals. Through collaboration multiple spatial and temporal configurations documented in our research provide unique insights into the role of subject/object-place relationships and practice in cultural continuity, tradition, and cultural transformation.

David Graeber has argued that slavery played a key role in the origin of commercial systems. The transition at issue concerns the melding of human economies (which make and remake relations between people) with commercial economies (which concern the acquisition of goods and wealth). Social currencies power human economies, but such money can never substitute for a person because each person and their relations are unique. Sufficient violence, however, can reduce a person to mere property, a slave. In a well-known passage from Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel states that the bondsman (the slave) has no consciousness of own: his/her essential nature is to live for the lord.

Recent studies suggest that dental calculus may provide a better preservation environment for DNA than other archaeological materials, yet this hypothesis has not been systematically tested. In this study, we adopt a non-targeted shotgun approach to analyze the preservation of microbial and human DNA in 48 paired dental calculus and dentin samples from archaeological contexts. These represent a broad spatial and temporal breadth and thus contribute to a better understanding of DNA preservation in dental calculus independent of burial context, age of the sample, and depositional environment. Our investigation demonstrates that dental calculus offers a robust preservation environment for endogenous microbial DNA. In addition to the strong microbial signal, calculus consistently contained low amounts of human DNA, and thus may serve as an appropriate source of DNA for analyses of archaeological materials stemming from environments less conducive to molecular preservation.","2986","Symposium","Presenter","Allison_Mann",2986,0,8,"8","2",NA,"Symposium",2,"Th-morning"

","Historic","Ancient DNA","Cultural Heritage and Preservation","Bengal cotton muslin, a particularly fine type of woven cotton fabric, had legendary status where it was traditionally produced in East Bengal—now Bangladesh—for at least 2000 years. During the colonial influence of the British Empire, muslin was widely traded outside of South Asia, and became a valuable global commodity with major impacts on both local producers and foreign markets. Political turmoil and market forces, especially pressure from the East Indian Company, completely halted muslin manufacture in the early 20th century. As a result, “Phuti Karpas”—the variety of cotton required for its production owing to particular fiber characteristics, botanically Gossypium arboreum var. neglecta—was entirely lost. An extensive search was undertaken to locate any living example of neglecta in crop fields or in the wild, and a candidate wild population was identified. With only 100-250 year old herbarium specimens available for comparative materials, we use whole genome sequencing of modern and herbarium specimens to suggest that a wild-type Phuti Karpas has indeed been rediscovered. We describe molecular and morphometric results, as well as ongoing efforts to cultivate neglecta and revive of traditional practices for muslin weaving.","2986","Symposium","Presenter","Logan_Kistler",2986,0,8,"8","2",NA,"Symposium",2,"Th-morning"

Obsidian is one of the few materials that can provide evidence for long-distance exchange through geochemical analysis, although relatively few sourcing studies have been carried out on Preceramic obsidian. In this paper, we report recent pXRF results from obsidian recovered at two Preceramic sites: Las Estacas, an Early Archaic period site in the Yautepec Valley of Morelos, and Yuzanu 36, a Late Archaic site from the Nochixtlán Valley, Oaxaca. Our results show that in each case a single obsidian source predominates, with at least 94% of the Las Estacas sample (n=100) from Otumba and 100% of the Yuzanu 36 sample (n=31) sourced to Guadalupe Victoria. We compare the results from Las Estacas and Yuzanu 36 to Preceramic and Early Formative period obsidian sourcing data from elsewhere in Mesoamerica. Data for the Preceramic and initial Early Formative indicate that in most cases obsidian procurement was focused on a small number of sources with procurement diversifying by the later Early Formative. We discuss the implications of the evidence for means and patterns of obsidian exchange.

There are few bones, but a long bone diaphysis from a deer-sized animal has cut marks. Radiocarbon dating suggests an age of around 12,750 cal BP. While not extensive, Yuz 50 is among the most securely dated early sites in southern Mexico, and indicates that Pleistocene foragers inhabited high altitude environments, were familiar with local lithic outcrops, and probably used barranca floodplains in their subsistence activities. The large number of megafaunal bones in the same palaeosol complex raises the possibility that these included hunting large prey.","2985","Electronic Symposium","Presenter","Jon_Lohse",2985,0,14,"14","3.5",NA,"Electronic Symposium",3.5,"Th-morning"

The sites include: Peñon Woman III skeleton, Santa Isabel Iztapan Mammoths with associated lithics, Tlapacoya Man Skull, Tocuila Mammoths, Tequixquiac Late Pleistocene Fossils and Tepexpan Man Skeleton. 
We present here a general model of strong environmental changes occurring during the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene transition that affected human and megafaunal communities in this area. Together with the presence of large volcanic eruptions from Nevado de Toluca and Popocatepetl Volcanoes that produced important tephra markers in the Basin of Mexico. The earliest directly dated human, Peñon Woman III (Age: 10, 755 +/- 75 BP) is one of the most complete and well preserved Paleoindian skeletons from the Americas. 
The Santa Isabel Iztapan Mammoths I and II were found together with lithics of Scottsbluff, Lerma and Angostura types and obsidian prismatic blades but not with Clovis type points normally associated with mammoth kill sites and butchering. The lithics were found in a layer after the Pumice with Andesite tephra layer (PWA) and they have an estimated date between 14,500 BP and 10,900 BP.

Because these transitional-looking assemblages were recovered from early Holocene contexts, we believe they potentially represent groups of early Archaic peoples who were separated from other groups that also practiced blade technology, possibly before they reached the UCP. The transitional nature of the assemblages suggests that blade technology gradually went away as people became increasingly familiar with the local environment, and therefore raw material sources. We further believe that these were family foraging groups that were seasonally occupying these shelters.

Formalized bifacial projectile points are certainly the residues of systems of social interaction, and therefore have the potential to tell us something about social networks. The idea that relationships between artifact variability and social networks are simple, however, can be challenged on both theoretical and empirical grounds: complex systems science and ethnographic data strongly suggest that patterns of person-level interaction do not directly correspond to patterns of material culture visible at archaeological scales. A model-based approach can be used to better understand how changes in human-level behaviors “map up” to changes in both the system-level characteristics of social networks and the patterns of artifact variable that we can describe using archaeological data. Such an approach will allow us to more confidently interpret changes in patterns of artifact variability in terms of changes in the characteristics and spatial continuity/discontinuity of social networks during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition in the Eastern Woodlands.","2984","Symposium","Presenter","Andrew_White",2984,0,13,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Th-morning"

Previous excavations identified three bone deposits. Bone Bed 1, the oldest deposit, yielded a single uncalibrated radiocarbon date of 12,460 +/- 490 BP. Investigators in the 1960s and 1980s argued that the patterned distribution of megafaunal elements associated with large limestone cobbles in Bone Bed 1 suggests human subsistence activity. However, no formal artifacts were recovered. Mounting evidence for earlier than Clovis occupations elsewhere in Texas, combined with advances in dating technology and spatial analysis, catalyzed new research into Bonfire Shelter’s deepest deposits. In the summer of 2017, Texas State University archaeologists excavated a 3x1m2 trench into intact Bone Bed 1 deposits. A three-tiered approach was implemented to identify evidence of human activity: targeted sampling for microdebitage in association with Pleistocene megafauna, a Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry based spatial analysis of faunal remains, and a column sample addressing the depositional environment of the shelter over 12,000 radiocarbon years ago.

Archaeological evidence indicates that these locations were utilized extensively by pre-contact Native American groups. The geological processes that shaped these landforms and produced outcropping lithic material also created ideal conditions for the growth plant food resources, particularly root crops. These root crops thrive on the lithosols containing outcropping toolstone and were extensively harvested by Plateau groups in the past. The Columbia Hills of south-central Washington State exemplifies this pattern. Myriad lithic extraction sites cover the ridgelines and slopes of the Columbia Hills, a landform that is also blanketed with important root crops. This paper examines the relationship between food resources, toolstone, and settlements in the Columbia Hills area. The distribution of Columbia Hills quarry sites and their spatial orientation in relation to subsistence resources and habitation locales in the surrounding area is indicative of the intensified use of the landscape for both food and lithic resource procurement. Comparisons to other areas within the Columbia Plateau suggest the presence of a regional pattern of intensive lithic procurement coinciding spatially with collector systems involving intensified plant resource gathering.","2976","Symposium","Presenter","Ron_Adams",2976,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-morning"

At Rein, tabular chert occurs in residual loams and mined in up to four meter deep shafts.

Ochre is used worldwide for symbolic and functional purposes, and is often considered to be evidence for symbolic behavior by cognitively modern Paleolithic humans. Geochemical provenience analysis, complemented by ethnographic studies of ochre source exploitation, transport, and use, can elucidate whether culturally mediated source exploitation differs significantly from a least-cost energetics (closest source) model of source use. In 2015–2017 we sampled 53 ochre deposits in the Kenya Rift Valley, guided by Maasai, Samburu, and Dorobo informants. The strontium isotope ratio (87/86 Sr) and elemental composition of these sources were characterized using Electron Probe MicroAnalysis and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. Our results show that the Provenience Postulate is upheld at the regional scale by 87/86 Sr ratios and at the local scale by elemental composition, facilitating sourcing of cultural ochre.  Analysis of ochre recovered from the Elmenteitan Neolithic cremation burial site of Njoro River Cave shows that the pigment is derived from two sources 110 and 150 km to the south, despite the availability of high quality ochre at deposits 20-35 km away and nearby the main sources of obsidian artifacts found at this site.","2976","Symposium","Presenter","Andrew_Zipkin",2976,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-morning"

This is part of a PhD project which examines the lives of guano miners through archaeology and historic archives. Guano as a manure was highly sought as a fertilizer during the nineteenth century for its high contents of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium, nutrients needed for plant growth. It revolutionized farming practices across the world and catalyzed the colonization of remote islands with the intent of mining them. Very little is known about the daily experiences, regimes, and identities of guano miners on Mona Island, part of the Puerto Rican archipelago. Guano extraction started in Mona Island around 1854 under the Spanish government and lasted until 1936 under the USA government. During this period multiple international companies operated on Mona Island, relying on the manual labor of hundreds of workers. An examination of the lives of guano miners on Mona island is important to understand the hidden histories of itinerant laborers across the Caribbean post-emancipation, but also to shed light on the human story of modern industrial capitalism more widely.","2976","Symposium","Presenter","Victor_Serrano",2976,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-morning"

Many of these subterranean features have been created naturally through geologic processes. However, it is significant that in areas devoid of natural subterranean features, pre-historic Native Americans constructed subterranean features to substitute for their natural counter parts. The archaeological and ethnographic literature document that ritual subterranean features are distributed throughout North America. Evidence includes ritually deposited cordage and sandals in the south and western portion of the United States, origin myths associated with Wind Cave in the Black Hills of South Dakota, and in New England where artificial subterranean features were created.

The occurrence of “foreign” materials at surface and cave sites have become an increasingly well-documented phenomenon (Brady et al. 1997) and are indicative of transport of speleothems during ancient Maya cave visitations. This phenomenon has raise several questions such as the spatial and temporal extend of these interactions, practices, and specifically the relationship between Maya polities and proximal or distant caves. 

Geochemical analysis of samples by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analyses (INAA) is a very common and reliable practice. In this study we analyzed (71) samples comprised of various types of speleothems (Stalactites, stalagmites, flowstones, cave pearls) collected in various locales in Belize (Macal, Barton Creek, Pine Ridge, Roaring Creek, Cave’s Branch and Sibun Valley). Our samples were come from two separate expeditions, the Belize Valley Speleothem Project and provided by Dr. Holley Moyes (U.C.

Our results elucidates the use of INAA as a viable method of sourcing lithic materials, differentiating samples within the same cave and between different caves.

This case-study examines the results from the compositional analysis of the ceramic wares from the site of Potrero Mendieta, in southwestern Ecuador, and the historical processes of social interaction and movement of peoples associated with this context through different regions by way of the inter-Andean Jubones River Valley at around the first millennium BCE.

Accordingly, the Late Paracas period (370-200 BC) in the Palpa valleys (Andean Transect) serves as a case study for this archaeoeconomic approach.
The results show exchange processes in the western Andes that are characterized by unbalanced commodity flows. Resources from the highlands such as obsidian, camelids and their products – for instance wool – arrived at the Pacific desert strip in large amounts, while marine resources such as sea shells reached highland regions only in small amounts.

While artifact variability in the region has largely been organized in hypothetical phases, expanded data on garment design and production details, as well as imagery, is most usefully organized and correlated using a formal typology. While social diversity may account for a larger percentage of formal variation than has been considered under the phase model, hypothetical temporal sequences among garment styles imply processes of adoption and syncretism.  While to date we cannot document the geographic loci of garment production, correlations between characteristics of plant and animal fibers, natural and dyed colors and particular style groups suggest a vertical organization of production and exchange that ranged from agricultural selection and herd management practices to the contribution of a finished textile to a particular mortuary rite. Artifact forms and component materials support a model of sociopolitical relationships linking diverse communities of practice, whose presence, prominence and self-definitions change over time.

At approximately AD 1200, bead makers shifted from a highly regular production sequence resulting in standardized chaquira (tiny beads) made from the ritually and economically significant shellfish, Spondylus, to one that is more opportunistic and results in irregular beads rarely made from Spondylus. This “destandardization” is associated with external economic forces, but also highlights the significance of the bead maker community of practice. Bead making endured the near complete loss of a market for chaquira, by becoming more flexible in their production strategy. That is, they tweaked their technological style to fit a new situation. In this way, bead makers retained their identity, as is demonstrated in the inclusion of raw material, production debris and tools in burials.

The initial industry (LCA type) is characterized by a stylistic homogeneity coupled with a wide geographical distribution. Compositional analyses, however, have shown a significant regularity in pastes, suggesting the use of localized sources of raw materials and/or specific production centers—indicative of a well-defined recipe and style. Provenance studies have identified a locus of production in the Guatacondo valley, in the hyper-arid core of the Atacama. In this valley the production and consumption of LCA pottery coincides with the emergence of mud architecture. Both technologies were developed in a geomorphological environment characterized by multiple outcrops of clay, making this material easily accessible. 
Using archaeometric methods, we approach both traditions as technological practices that required specific technical gestures, bodily engagements, labor organization, and temporal rhythms, mobilizing a collective that was partially constituted as such through the repeated and enduring transformation of mud. Considering the networks of materials, practices, and spheres of circulation wrought by these technologies, we offer an interpretation of the Formative process that centers on the qualities of clay in order to understand the material trajectories of this social landscape.

An imperfect and highly political process, claimants must overcome the legacies of out-migration, Christianity, and iconoclasm which have unevenly configured the distribution and knowledge of the past.

Tribes, however, encounter several capacity-related challenges in developing tribally-specific heritage management plans. These challenges include the lack of funding for tribal historic preservation and repatriation, shortage of qualified staff, and, most significantly, operating within a heritage framework that was not designed with the needs or interests of tribes in mind. Given these significant challenges, how can an indigenous nation make archaeology work for and in accordance with tribal needs and values? Using the case study of Field Methods in Indigenous Archaeology, this paper evaluates how community-based research with the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Community of Oregon contributes to a uniquely Grand Ronde way for doing archaeology. Preliminary outcomes from FMIA suggest that indigenizing archaeology not only transforms our discipline’s relationship with and to indigenous communities, but builds our--archaeologists' and tribes'--collective capacity to care for and protect tribal heritage for future generations.

The presentation, besides including a brief description of the artifacts, it is aimed at reconstructing the objects’ unknown contextual information through a comparison with similar objects held in American, Mexican and European museums, some of them proceeding from scientifically excavated caves. The comparative analysis, integrated by information deriving from Mixtec codices and early colonial Spanish historical sources, suggests that a group of caves in Puebla and Oaxaca contained similar sets of sacred bundles representing earthly beings known as ñuhu in Mixtec language. The bundles must have been used in ritual performances related with the reciprocal exchange of gifts between humans and extra human beings. The aim of the paper is thus to provide the artifacts in the NMAI collection with some of the contextual information that was lost when they were looted from the cave. In this way, the artifacts reacquire their status of powerful instantiations of earthly fertility, thus becoming much more meaningful both for Mesoamericanist scholars and contemporary indigenous communities.

In the colonial period, Andean artists produced wooden qeros, many of which were decorated using a polychrome inlay technique. Almost all extant polychromed wooden qeros attributed to the colonial period derive from museum and private collections and lack provenience and precise means of dating. Here, we investigate the chronology and production of qeros by characterizing lead white pigment (lead hydroxycarbonate or lead carbonate, introduced to the Andes by the Spanish) used in the decoration of these vessels. We analyzed the Pb isotopic composition of lead white pigments taken from 21 colonial period qeros that currently reside in the collections of the National Museum of the American Indian-Smithsonian Insitution, the American Museum of Natural History, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and in private collections. The results indicate that, during the early colonial period Andean artists initially used lead white pigment manufactured from Spanish ores. In contrast, later period qeros were decorated with lead white pigment that was likely synthesized from local ore sources. Based on these results, we suggest the isotopic composition of lead white pigment may function as a chronological marker for colonial period qeros.

At the Smithsonian’s NMNH and NMAI, the availability of such material, combined with extensive collections of ethnographic weavings, facilitates engagement with both ancient and contemporary weaving traditions in ways that helps maximize what we can learn from the limited archaeological record. Drawing on long-term work with Smithsonian collections, this presentation considers first the insights obtained from a study of little-known historic Plains coiled gambling baskets with implications for understanding the precontact origins of that complex. Second, I review results of research on prehispanic Chacoan (ca.

By retroactively implementing an accession lot system and creating virtual accession files of digitized documents, we have reunited documentation stored in NMAI archives with associated objects. The project reverses the typical methodology of starting with an object and searching for its related documentation; instead, we have systematically reviewed archival documents, matched them with objects, and connected sometimes far-flung and previously lost bits of information. As a result, we have uncovered detailed and complex connections between our objects and hundreds of collectors and archaeologists not previously visible in our museum catalog, all of which is readily available to researchers.

While the original contexts of many museum objects have been lost, the collection of Panamanian gold and resin in the National Museum of the American Indian was re-evaluated for its potential to answer key questions about the ancient craftspeople of this region. To ensure accurate provenience information was associated with each artifact, research was undertaken in the archives of the NMAI. The resulting letters and field notebooks provided insight into the fascinating history of these objects. Scientific analysis further contextualized these objects in terms of the materials and fabrication techniques. Compositional analysis of 231 gold objects using XRF revealed significant patterns related to the source of the raw materials and the technological choices that went into making them. Three resin objects also underwent FTIR and GC-MS analysis to identify the plant source of the resin. This project has produced valuable technical data on this region that has been relatively understudied archaeologically and additional detailed information has been added to the museum records for each of the objects in this study.","2971","Symposium","Presenter","Ainslie_Harrison",2971,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-morning"

","Bronze Age","Digital Archaeology","Theory","Digital methods in archaeology have led to new ways of recording, analyzing, and presenting archaeological sites and materials, but these new methods are adopted within the context of previously existing practices of archaeological work. Some digital recording methods in excavation build upon and sometimes displace long-standing analog methods with proven results. Digital representations of cultural materials present novel interpretive affordances compared to analog representations that, while they suggest new possibilities for analysis and scholarly communication, also challenge traditional framings through which such materials have been understood. This paper discusses these challenges in the context of implementing a ‘born-digital’ site-recording methodology at Kaymakçi, a Middle and Late Bronze Age site in western Anatolia, focusing on the effects of new digital techniques on concepts central to archaeological practice such as accuracy and precision, diligence and orthopraxy, as well as implications for working with digital representations of cultural materials in the lab and beyond.

The application includes Mesa Verde National Park in the American southwest, the archaeological complex of Chavin de Huantar in the Peruvian highlands and the historic Ayutthaya in Thailand. The application will be available via mobile device on the Samsung Gear VR and the Oculus Rift virtual reality platforms. Each experience will combine 360 degree video interviews with scientific experts, dynamic audio interviews with site managers, digitized objects from several museum collections as well as fully navigable virtual environments of the archaeological sites. Brought together in VR the diverse multimedia contribute to a richer narrative.

Using recent fieldwork at the Greek colonial site of Histria in Romania as a case-study, this paper explores the space between high-quality 3D documentation used only by an internal audience and decontextualized 3D content designed for public consumption. In particular, we seek to determine whether high-quality, measurable 3D models derived from photogrammetrical capture are useful in communicating excavation results to other scholars – and if so, in what ways.

Twenty-four educational institutions throughout Australia, Canada, and the United States received tomb groups for research, study, and display.

Digitization can be daunting, though: it requires an investment in people, technology, and space; and an awareness of standards that can appear to be constantly changing. This practical presentation is designed for collections managers, curators, and conservators new to digitizing collections or who want to build on a nascent digitization program. It will also be helpful for archaeologists coping with legacy archaeology materials. The presentation will touch on how to evaluate current resources, short term goals, and long term goals. It will also cover the topic of archival standards for digitizing collections, where to find them, and how to select standards for your needs and goals.","2967","Symposium","Presenter","Jodi_Reeves Eyre",2967,2,14,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-morning"

Rita Wright’s valuable contributions to the archaeology of urbanism and holistic, multi-scalar approaches to settlement patterns is well-attested in her survey work along the Beas River Valley. This paper picks up these themes in a different region of the interconnected Bronze Age world that has been the focus of her research—ancient Oman.

Known as Magan in Mesopotamian texts, a considerable amount of research has been conducted on Bronze Age Oman by focusing on its external connections to other polities. In this paper, I present an alternative, hyper-local perspective on the archaeology of this area. Utilizing ceramic and survey data collected in the spring of 2017 from the region surrounding the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Bat and nearby remains at ‘Amlah, this paper works to shift the focus of research on ancient Oman inwards by examining connections between settlements in the Bat region. An analysis of the ceramics collected in this area suggests a temporally dynamic landscape, with shifting centers of activity. Taking a localized, historically-particular approach to the archaeology of interactions in this small area ultimately reveals the significance of even the smallest known settlements in ancient Oman.

As transformative processes, the methods and techniques of craft manufacture reflected the power of artisans to create and animate the material and social worlds.  Importantly, within media distinct technologies were often associated with different genders, classes, ethnicities, and other aspects of social identity.  Set within the context of the rise and fall of regional state-organized polities and waves of “contact” and conquest by more distant powers, I discuss how technological stability in some media reflected the persistence of autochthonic identities, “traditional” social structures, and indigenous claims to place, while the episodic introduction of new technologies – some developed locally and some “imported” by more distant conquerors – reflected the assertion of new loci of authority, the restructuring of sociopolitical relationships, and claims to different modes of prestige.","2966","Symposium","Presenter","Cathy_Costin",2966,0,12,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-morning"

Prof. Wright has established a suite of concepts and critiques that generate a comparative framework that is not restricted to a single geographical area. In her early work on ceramic production and craft, Wright synthesized the anthropology of technology with the archaeology of the Indo-Iranian borderlands, laying the foundation for a technological approach that transformed the archaeology of South Asia. Her critical re-evaluation of early cities, states, and complex societies incorporated past people and groups previously omitted from investigation, bringing to the forefront the political and economic dimensions of households and other social entities. Her work also drove the archaeology of identity and gender, correcting traditional approaches that too often left humanity out of explanations of the past. She has also established a landscape approach that examines the social relations that connected the city of Harappa to its many surrounding settlements, she has revealed rural/urban interactions that drove the emergence and transformation of urbanism. The impact of these contributions is ongoing, and has set the agenda for a new generation of comparative archaeology.

Previous scholarship has focused on the style and origin of these pins, generally associated with female adornment, but both the cuneiform and material records also allow for glimpses into the economic power they held for women during this period. For example, the Old Assyrian mercantile indicate that pins could function as working capital in times of need. Furthermore, the survival of their impressions on crescent-shaped loom weights across Anatolia also demonstrate their importance to the economic agency of women. Through a study of the various types of pins and their associated objects within the contextual framework provide by the texts, this paper will explore the multiple roles of these personal objects and analyze how both Anatolian and Assyrian women used pins to mediate the social, religious, and economic worlds in which they navigated.","2966","Symposium","Presenter","Nancy_Highcock",2966,0,12,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-morning"

","Neolithic","Paleoethnobotany","Landscape Archaeology","While trees are often integral to the ecology of certain landscapes, the propagation of specific woody taxa can also reflect significant social aspects imbued on anthropogenic spaces. Following the seminal work of Rita Wright, we are utilizing a comparative approach in this paper. We examined woody vegetation management by early food producing societies in two regions of southern Arabia: southeastern Arabia (modern-day northern Oman) and southwestern Arabia (modern-day southeast Yemen). Despite their nearby geographic position, the trajectory of food production is distinct in these two regions. Nonetheless, both agrarian landscapes are impacted and developed by certain woody taxa. Using a niche construction framework, the concept of a “keystone species” is reinvisioned by utilizing archaeological, anthracological, and ethnographic datasets. These proxies enable us to investigate the social and ecological impact of the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) in southeastern Arabia and the fig tree (Ficus spp L.) in southwestern Arabia. This paper explores the modern social value of each tree type, the role of these woods in the agrarian history of each respective region, and how the southern Arabian landscape has been shaped and modified by association to these trees.","2966","Symposium","Presenter","Abigail_Buffington",2966,0,12,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-morning"

These “borderland” studies led to insights concerning exchange, production, and the roles of elite managers and non-elite “labor”. Archaeologists and economists examined the material culture of dozens of sites to assess changing borderland partnership networks. This evidence revealed innovations in management and production strategies. Those innovations led rapidly to spectacular wealth, yet growing inequality, in a new economic system, while more conservative central lowland Maya states to the north were declining.

As in Wright’s approach, this material culture history of these “borderlands” provided a foundation for application of social and economic theory including Innovation Network theories and Network Failure theories from economics. This research is directed upward to examine the “big picture” of changing state economic structure and “downward” to identify the agents and forms of agency involved.

Intra-valley migrations and eventual abandonment marked the Yadkin; population growth, settlement coalescence, and eventual abandonment in the Dan; and population stability and settlement coalescence in the Eno and Haw. Contextualizing PVT demography in the larger Southeast will help us understand how small-scale societies compared to neighboring chiefdoms, chieftaincies, and confederacies and what that means for the relationship between sociopolitical form and different demographic trends during this period.","2965","Symposium","Presenter","Eric_Jones",2965,1,11,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-morning"

AD 1400 and then left the region en masse ca. AD 1650, becoming one of several contemporary Central Algonquian tribes.  However, new data raise the possibility that this interpretation needs revision.  First, through a biodistance analysis we learn that at least some Anderson and Madisonville groups were not closely related biologically.  Second, we know from oral histories that Dhegiha Siouans departed the Ohio Valley at the same time as the Madisonville shift and have recently learned that the Anderson pattern is very similar to several Dhegiha accounts.  Hence, it is now possible to question whether the Anderson cultural system relates to Dhegiha Siouans moreso than the Madisonville one that may be more closely related to Central Algonquians.  Reasons explored to account for the potential for multiple departures include various mixes of environmental and cultural push/pull factors, such as deteriorating climatic conditions for agriculture, increased interest in bison, and increased pressures from Iroquoians who were interested in the region for both the burgeoning fur trade and slave raiding.","2965","Symposium","Presenter","Robert_Cook",2965,1,11,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-morning"

Beginning in the early 1300s, evidence for Mississippian practices appear within Late Pisgah phase communities in the central portion of the Appalachian Summit.  These settlements include small farmsteads, palisaded villages, and sites with platform mounds.  In addition to the Pisgah culture, the late Mississippian Qualla phase (1450 -1838 CE)  represents the only other Mississippian society in the Appalachian Summit.  These communities are contemporaneous with Late Pisgah sites to the north, sharing similar house architecture and pottery attributes.  However, Qualla sites are restricted to river valleys within the southwest while Pisgah pottery is found across a much larger area of the greater southern Appalachians. These two Mississippian complexes maintained a spatial separation within areas where both pottery types are found.  With cycles of more or less integration of Mississippian groups, the period of 1300-1500 CE was a complex and dynamic period of interaction and growth in the Appalachian Summit.

What experimental studies indicate is that we can isolate patterns of feeding associated with particular carnivores, but what has not been demonstrated is whether we see differences between domestic and wild canids. We propose that one solution is to move beyond the marks on the bone and look at where they are found in campsites. Through our ongoing ethnoarchaeological study of the Dukha reindeer herders of north-central Mongolia, we use GPS tracking, photogrammetry, and mapping of canids and modified bone to isolate spatial patterning of domestic dog behavior.

The content and configuration of occupied surfaces offer not only information about activities carried out there, but also the potential for interpreting the role of site usage within a larger settlement pattern.

We examine the relationship between total camp area and the number of bison hide tipis (reflected by surface stone rings) present at these archaeological sites. We attempt to control for a variety of factors that might condition stone circle visibility and density, including palimpsest occupations, in establishing whether these camps became denser or less dense as the number of co-campers increased. We also compare our results to those observed in a global ethnographic dataset. The latter suggest mobile hunter-gatherer societies do not take advantage of the opportunities for energized crowding that characterize more sedentary societies.

The approach uses animal remains to explain variability among site features by looking into the differential taphonomic histories of the bones, most importantly in the post-discard stage. Archaeofaunal remains are normally ubiquitous in foragers’ camps and their histories are readily deciphered, potentially making them excellent indicators of site-formation processes, refuse behavior and activity areas and, by extension, of site type and occupation intensity. A contextual taphonomy approach was recently applied to Late Epipaleolithic (Natufian) animal remains in Mount Carmel, Israel (ca. 15,000-11,700 cal. BP) in order to discern the formation and function of architectural contexts of these semi-sedentary foragers. At the Natufian basecamp of el-Wad Terrace, the contextual taphonomy approach identified fluctuations in site-occupation intensity through the 3,500-year-long Natufian sequence of the site. It also showed that a sequence of structures was used for everyday living activities, probably at the household level. Conversely, at the Natufian cemetery site of Raqefet Cave, the animal remains reflected short and punctuated periods of human activity, corresponding with a specialized burial site.","2964","Symposium","Presenter","Reuven_Yeshurun",2964,1,11,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-morning"

Perspectives have shifted to emphasize the diversity of groups in the Caribbean during precolonial times, and how this continued into the colonial period as Europeans and Africans coalesced in the area. The conflictual aspect of this interaction whereby Europeans imposed a system of forced labor, along with drastic Indian population losses have obscured the contributions of indigenous peoples to colonial societies and culture.
This paper summarizes archaeological and historical data for Puerto Rico and Hispaniola on the diversity of Indian groups in the early colonial period and the different ways they reacted and responded to Old World peoples. It postulates the concept of cultural transformation to explain the process of change occurring among these populations, and how they employed strategies which varied from island to island. It discusses the evidence for the persistence of Indian groups well into the colonial period and what this may imply for the formation of creole societies, and ends with a call for further archaeological research focusing on early colonial sites.","2962","Symposium","Presenter","Karen_Anderson-Cordova",2962,1,11,"12","3",NA,"Symposium",3,"Th-morning"

Current archaeological investigations of the initial period of colonial settlement on Barbados focusing on Trents Plantation, and the pre-sugar era (1627-1640s) project an all-together different picture. The archaeological and historical record projects a multivalent, multicultural, mix of engagements between Indigenous, African, and European settlers. This complexity is expressed in the material record, particularly with the mix of locally produced and imported ceramics from the early 17th century plantation context at Trents.  The emerging colony on Barbados was English in name, but backed by the Dutch, and assisted by a group of Indigenous people who joined them from Guyana and Africans captured from a Portuguese ship.  Moreover, this colony was established in the 17th century Caribbean, a theater contested by the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and English, as well as a complex array of Indigenous peoples.  The result was the construction of a complex multi-vocal cultural ensemble of cultural and material expressions that is consistent with the dynamic cultural diversity that emerged in the region.

The application of category of indio has blurred, denigrated, and homogenized these people and the plurality of ways in which they interacted, placed themselves, and were present in the creole universe of the Caribbean. The production of simplistic views of the creolization process is due to the focus on the inter-cultural engagements between Europeans and Indians or between Europeans and Africans. Moroever, such perspectives have obscured the plurality of the indigenous groups who resided in the Caribbean. In this session, we will also explore a range of theoretical and methodological perspectives used in the studies of the heritage and cultural continuity of the Indigenous presence in the Caribbean. Many earlier models are based on outdated reductionist notions that leave little room to study processes such as transculturation, hybridization and ethnogenesis.

Both of these occupations coincide with population peaks at nearby Yaxuná. Judging by the ample open spaces surrounding the site’s house groups, people living “out there” at Tzacauil may have been drawn to the opportunities presented by the relatively uninhabited intra-settlement landscape. With these open spaces as a starting point, this paper explores how people at Tzacauil physically moved within the intra-settlement landscape of their rural community. The transformation of intra-settlement spaces through the construction of formal and informal walkways suggests that the two chronologically distinct communities engaged with the rural landscape in remarkably different ways.

","Maya: Classic","Survey","Settlement Patterns","The Classic Maya, with their towering jungle temples and sprawling cities have been the focus of archaeological studies since the mid-1800s. Although numerous investigations have fostered considerable insights, important questions remain regarding the circumstances in which these settlements originated, interacted, developed, and were ultimately abandoned. The organization of Maya settlements is best conceptualized as a continuum consisting of three basic, but variable types, including: upper-level, middle-level, and lower-level settlements. This discussion reviews the primary research results for the full-coverage survey and test-excavation program conducted at the middle-level hinterland settlement of Waybil, Belize, Central America. The overall result was the collection of valuable information concerning the development of the central courtyard, peripheral settlement groups, and relic agricultural terraces found within the site. Middle-level settlements such as Waybil are unique units within the continuum as they are smaller and more specialized than upper-level settlements, but larger and more diverse than lower-level settlements. Thus, they are thought to have performed distinct roles and functions within the greater settlement matrix. Exploring the configuration of individual middle-level settlements is essential to improving our knowledge of ancient Maya socio-political and socio-economic interactions, hinterland archaeology, human-environment adaptive strategies, and the circumstances surrounding the Classic period “collapse”.

Although non-elites include some urban residents and all hinterland residents, this study proposes that some hinterland residents also identified as elites. The Medicinal Trail Community is a hinterland settlement with considerable variation in household complexity, ranging from simple perishable structures informally arranged, to households on elevated platforms formally arranged around a courtyard. The latter residents attempted to adopt the social identity of the urban elites by using the symbols and material culture of the “Urban Elites,” therefore becoming “Hinterland Elites.”  As a result, these “Hinterland Elites” economic and socio-political status was elevated above most of the community’s inhabitants, providing them with limited social power. Although their elite identity was probably not acknowledged by the urban centers, by distinguishing themselves from those in their immediate community, they used this identity to gain and maintain power within the community.","2959","Symposium","Presenter","David M._Hyde",2959,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-morning"

Elite and noble trajectories appear to have been strongly tied to shifting power structures, whereas commoner trajectories were less dependent on political transitions.

The project was initially designed to examine the ways Preclassic Maya leaders institutionalized political authority from the perspective of household archaeology, but has expanded to include excavation of civic architecture and remote sensing in open spaces. My research is informed by collective action theory, and the degree to which leaders engaged in exclusionary and inclusive practices over the site’s 2000 years of occupation. Findings have not supported my original exclusive power hypothesis in which early rulers circumvented kin-based authority by out-competing and fragmenting established households. Instead, the small number of founding elite and commoner houses enjoyed socio-economic prosperity during the Terminal Preclassic period when kingship was institutionalized. The rise to regional authority was rapid at Actuncan, which was built by burying an earlier settlement and greatly expanding civic structures.

Later, Classic-period elites experienced boom-and-bust cycles of growth and abandonment, which I argue is the result of elite competition for exclusive power.

Such high levels of redeposited domestic trash, and the arrangement of these plots, suggest that agricultural and water drainage activity took place at an intra-household or larger community level.

Based on soil chemistry and proximity to the river, this area may have been used as a cacao orchard, thus creating an economic opportunity that could have benefitted the entire community. Together, these systems reflect how the ancient Maya at Actuncan managed water and agricultural production, and the scale at which these technologies were administered.

The literature on ancient Maya urbanism focuses to a large extent on how urban spaces are arranged and what this says about social and political organization. However, the long occupations of many Maya centers resulted in urban centers that reflect a palimpsest of decision-making over centuries rather than a single grand plan. Indeed, evidence at many Maya sites suggests that urban plans were reworked as buildings were built, destroyed, renovated, repurposed, and abandoned based on present needs. So-called “problematical deposits”—detritus left in and on abandoned spaces and buildings—provide evidence that the later Maya acknowledged the differentially utilized nature of their urban centers. Yet, modifications to the urban landscape result from decisions made by someone: households, communities, leaders, or conquerors. As such, palimpsest urbanism is both a way of life and a product of political action.

At some point they abandoned their arctic-based tool complex for one more adapted to an entirely different environment. The dispersal of that new techno-complex — Clovis — allows us to examine, at a fine scale, how colonization processes played out across a vast continent that at the time had at best a very small resident population. Clovis has figured prominently in American archaeology since the first Clovis points were identified in eastern New Mexico in the 1930s, but the successful marriage of learning models grounded in evolutionary theory and modern analytical methods that began roughly a decade ago has begun to pay significant dividends in terms of what we know about the rapid spread of human groups across the last sizeable landmass to witness human occupation.

Fifteen artifacts recovered at Cerro El Sombrero Cima, representing 16% of the point assemblage at the site, are considered recycled tools made on Fishtail points.

In lithic research, archaeological science studies have investigated topics ranging from identifying raw material sources, assessing artefact function and technology, to modelling socio-cultural and evolutionary changes.

Despite the flourish of archaeological science, much of lithic research still operate on analytical units embedded with implicit behavioural assumptions that are difficult to falsify, and a largely common-sensical reasoning process that favours explanations relatable to our modern daily experience. By reviewing other archaeological science approaches, it is argued here that a more explicit discussion of the general science framework is needed in lithic research, with particular concern over the nature of analytical categories, the integrity and confidence of inference, and the ability to objectively evaluate competing causal explanations for the formation of archaeological pattern through multiple lines of evidence.","2952","Symposium","Presenter","Sam_Lin",2952,1,15,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-morning"

The study of the production and trade of metals is one of the means to highlight the technical and social organization of societies. Among several issues, the question of the provenance of the metal is of primary importance and can lead to enlighten the organization of the production (spatial and temporal structures of the chaine opératoire) and of the supply networks. Concerning iron and its alloys, these last years have seen important developments in archaeological sciences to address the question of provenance. These approaches are based on both trace elements and isotopic approaches.
The aim of this paper is to discuss the principle, potentiality, advantages and limits of the archaeological science approach through the example of two provenance studies applied to different socio-economical contexts.. The first one deals with the circulation of iron products in the North-Alpine area during the end of the First Iron Age (6th-5th c. BC). The second one concerns the use of iron reinforcements in the gothic monuments and cathedrals of the Middle Age in France. Finally, several prospects will be proposed for developing integrated and interdisciplinary provenance studies in the future.

","Other","Archaeometry & Materials Analysis: Glass Analysis","Craft Production","Scientific investigation of archaeological glass has advanced, beginning in the early 2000’s, with studies relying more heavily on determination of trace element concentrations to differentiate production recipes depending on distinct ingredient sources and the use of larger corpuses of artifacts to more easily and reliably reveal production patterns.  At the same time, isotope analyses (e.g., Pb, Sr and Nd) attempting to source raw materials used to manufacture glass in antiquity grew in importance, focusing mostly on glass produced around the Mediterranean basin.

In a new project, recently funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), we will combine trace element and isotope analyses to study the ancient glass industry of South Asia which, despite its importance and impact within and beyond the Indian Ocean region, is still poorly understood.  To this end, we will collect raw materials, test their suitability to obtain glass and compare the trace element and isotope signatures with those of different South Indian glass types.  By connecting Indian glass types to potential production regions in South Asia, the results of this project will illuminate the spatial and temporal interconnections between cultures and regions of the Indian Ocean and beyond.

Environmental history study agreed that during this period, mineral coal replaced charcoal and became the main fuel of metal industry in China. Our investigation however reveals this is a rather complex and uneven process. In the more arid and densely populated north China coal-fired tubular crucibles were widely adopted in this period. In contrast, the south China smelters continued the more traditional furnace smelting process. More interestingly, crucible technology seems not to be embraced by iron and copper smelters until early modern period. Even in north China, large scale iron smelters still use charcoal rather than mineral coal.

The south coast of Peru was one of the regions conquered relatively early by the expanding Inca state. Following incorporation, a series of Inca administrative centers were established, all linked by a highway. Tambo Viejo was established in the Acarí Valley. The south coast in general being incorporated peacefully, the control exercised by the Inca state likely was through local authorities. However, Inca control was brief and at most probably lasted no more than fifty years. As a result, the residents of valleys such as Acarí experienced little change in their daily life. The architecture of Tambo Viejo and the associated ceramics do not exhibit much outside influence. Though material items display only minor changes, Inca ideology is apparent in the manner in which the center was planned. Tambo Viejo, although built with architecture in the local tradition, was conceived following the standardized Inca structural pattern that included a large rectangular plaza and an enormous mound that likely was an ushnu.

This paper focuses on the site of, Maukallajta, in the Camata-Carijana Valley.  Also known as Pueblo Viejo, Maukallajta was an Inka tambo. It was likely established to promote trade with other groups (Alconini 2012; Capriles Flores and Herrero 2006). More specifically, the research explores how the impact of Inka colonialism affected the architectural patterns of Maukallajta. Therefore, the location, organization, and architecture of Maukallajta will be analyzed to understand its nature and purpose (Moore 1992, 2011; Pozorski and Moore 1997). Terraces and roads associated with the site will also be examined.
 
Maukallajta is just one colonial space in the Camata-Carijana landscape in eastern Bolivia. Other settlements, pre-Hispanic roads, and agrarian terraces are discussed to provide a regional perspective and to explore the relative impact of Inka colonial processes in the Camata-Carijana Valley.

The slipperiness of Cypriot history, how certain spaces are remembered and memorialised while others are ignored or actively forgotten, demonstrates the intangibility of the past. Different narratives are attached to different phases of the Cypriot past: antiquity is concealed within a cloak of Hellenism, while the more recent Orthodox past is revered with great pride, and the turbulent recent past is proclaimed through the very name of the local kafeneio, the Parthenon.
Drawing upon local stories passed down over the generations, I explore how places within and around the village (local archaeological sites, copper mines, residues of British colonial activity, EOKA hideouts, abandoned villages) are variously remembered, forgotten, understood and represented, to actively create a sense of being Cypriot.

This is especially true following the Roman conquest of Iberia in the late 3rd century BCE, when the scale of mining increased dramatically to accommodate the growing needs of the Roman Empire. This was made possible through dramatic shifts in the organization of labor and the technological practices surrounding mining. Scholars often attribute these changes to Roman innovation, ignoring the long-term history of indigenous mining in many areas and the potential significance of local people in the successes of the industry. In this paper, I challenge this conventional interpretation and explore the diverse contributions of local people to the mining industry, from their knowledge of local resource distribution to their work as laborers in mining and subsidiary industries. I argue that Roman conquest transformed the everyday lives of local people, who in turn participated in the diverse communities of practice in Roman mining landscapes, contributing knowledge, skills, and resources that fueled this industry so key to the creation of the Roman Empire.

It critically focuses on previous classificatory systems of Olmec deities. Iconographers often identify individual deities on the basis of defining attributes or material accoutrements, frequently extending these identifications across contexts (as in Covarrubias’ famous “evolution of the Mesoamerican rain god”). However, building in part on Eva Hunt’s work, we find that the conflation or sharing of attributes among Formative period entities casts doubt on the validity of classificatory schemes that fail to adequately consider the fluidity of deities or their relationship to that which they personify. This “conceptual overlap” in Olmec art may lead to confusion, misidentification, or overly simplistic interpretations. It is argued that the construction of deity systems should consider such conceptual overlaps in representational art, in order to more fully unpack the multiple, non–hierarchical levels of significance imbricated in images of gods and supernaturals, as well as the dynamism of such representations within larger symbolic complexes. A range of data from various contexts are considered in an effort to evaluate the utility of cross–cultural analogies in comparative iconography.","2949","Symposium","Presenter","Joshua_Englehardt",2949,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Th-morning"

The figure appears in narrative scenes with the major Tajín deities, often playing what seems to be a subsidiary role. The most important association in these scenes is with a liquid-filled temple that plays a key role scenes of ballcourt ritual. The same deity appears in pars pro toto representations of sacrificial scenes with numerous figures from the Tajín court. Finally, the deity also appears in a complex aquatic scene on a portable sculpture. 
Certain consistencies in the imagery across narrative contexts and media suggest that this figure embodies the fruit of particularly important decapitation sacrifices.

Weakly defined by a set of slippery contrasts - isolated from what came before and what comes after - the descriptor lacks robust categorization of its own. And yet in spite of this hollow terminology, the words “Epi-Olmec” themselves are so politically fraught that certain scholars have adopted the even more obfuscatory term “Isthmian”, a label growing in popularity within the literature. This paper begins the process of defining Epi-Olmec in its own right. Whether understood primarily as a time period, geographic region, visual culture program, or hieroglyphic system, Epi-Olmec art and writing have much to offer the study of early Mesoamerican material culture. Rather than setting Epi-Olmec apart from more robustly-defined predecessors, neighbors, and successors, this paper will use Epi-Olmec visual culture to inform upon them. What connections can be drawn, for example, between Epi-Olmec forms and Classic Veracruz deities? How might an understanding of Classic Veracruz iconography illuminate the complexities of Epi-Olmec supernaturals? By upending the historic practice of “reading” Epi-Olmec art through a Maya/Izapan lens, this paper will instead turn toward the west, opening a new avenue for the study and definition of Epi-Olmec visual culture.","2949","Symposium","Presenter","Stephanie_Strauss",2949,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Th-morning"

Veracruz, a region implicated via the activities of both avatars, is particularly enmeshed in this duality.

The Postclassic narrative whereby Quetzalcoatl journeyed to the Gulf lowlands appears to be foreshadowed in the desacralization of Teotihuacan’s Feathered Serpent Pyramid at the end of the third century AD. This ritual destruction has been linked to a political realignment at Teotihuacan, instigating the departure of refugee groups who fled the Basin of Mexico.

The founding of Classic Period Matacapan, in the Tuxtla Mountains of southern Veracruz, may have been linked to this exodus. This paper considers the regional impact of this relocation via the appearance of Quetzalcoatl imagery along the Veracruz lowlands, both through overt representations as well as potential proxies (e.g., Reptile Eye glyph, Venus symbolism, the ehecacozcatl “wind jewel”). Variations in how Feathered Serpent imagery is manifest could well reflect autochthonous lowland ideals versus notions related to an intrusive highland cosmovision. Thus, not all Quetzalcoatl imagery is equal, nor is it equally unfettered.

The Epiclassic period offers a particularly fruitful set of iconographic relationships forged across Mesoamerica. Regional ethnographic analogy has also been applied.

Huaca Negra is a fishing village locates in the northwest of the Virú Valley and is 1.2 kilometers from the current shoreline. The site was occupied between 5,000-3,200 CalBP, from Late Preceramic Period to Initial Period, which witnessed the transitions from non-sedentary activity to a settled village, from sedentism to the construction of the mound, and finally from the usage to the abandonment of the mound. 
Along with these social changes, the long-term occupation provides a unique opportunity to study early coastal life. The comparison of four activities (fishing, shellfish collecting, hunting, and planting) and its diachronic change help to reveal the nature of subsistence system in both Late Preceramic and Initial Period. The preferred catchment zones, change of coping strategy and the implication of social change will also be addressed.

We conducted a stratigraphic examination of these contexts, and carried out radio carbon dating to further analyze the processes of constructing mound and its change over time. These analyses revealed that accumulation of food waste midden and embedded mortuary contexts caused the growing of mound volume in the CV-1 phase, and the abruptly change to the beginning of architecture construction on the mound: an activity of constructing a room and the reconstructions of floors and walls which led to the division of inside space in the CV-2 phase. These processes indicate that the monumentality of mounds gradually increased in the CV-1 phase as the mortuary and food waste accumulating practice, and the increased monumentality caused the change of the utilization of this place around 2800 cal.

The lack of knowledge of the mammalian community is notable considering all that is known about the glacial, climate, and vegetative history.  An initial step in this research is the study of bison ecology through the application of stable isotope signatures (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and strontium) derived from discrete downtooth samples of modern and prehistoric bison.

A study of roach gnawing was initiated after a number of defleshed mammal bones were discovered extensively modified. Six human skeletons that were similarly processed in a neighboring suite were also surveyed for insect damage. Gnaw marks were examined under a stereomicroscope using 10-40x magnification. A feeding experiment with housed roaches demonstrated this insect’s ability to modify bone. Locations of extensive roach feeding appeared superficially similar to small rodent gnawing, but the two agents were clearly separable under low magnification. Roach mandibular scrapings and their patterns were similar to those previously reported for termites. This study shows the widely distributed American cockroach can and will modify thin cortical bone and underlying trabeculae; and suggests this highly omnivorous species favors soft tissue and bone lipids.

","Historic","Experimental Archaeology","Material Culture and Technology","Introduction of dedicated paediatric medicine, was an advancement arriving in Britain late compared to its neighbours such as France’s ‘Enfant Malades’ in 1802. Paediatric hospitals were a consequence of physicians' financial aspirations rather than falsely portrayed ‘community need’ (Lomax, 1998). Their establishment contradicted longstanding attitudes surrounding children as ‘incomplete beings…whom it was wasteful to devote attention to’ (Porter, 1989). Oddly, amputation saw children harness the same attention as adults, and despite being overused, crudely performed with poor survival rates and aftercare, evidence exists of child amputees surviving into adulthood and of child prostheses. This paper will discuss complicated beliefs surrounding paediatric care in nineteenth-century Britain, concentrating on archaeological evidence of prostheses available for juvenile amputees. It asks why, in a society with poor paediatric care, was amputation and prosthesis provisioned for? What sparked the changes to children’s healthcare which saw institutions such as Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, introduced in 1852? Analysis of Victorian prosthetic devices and medical procedures will help demonstrate that whilst children occupied the role of ‘society's future’, lingering attitudes, contributed to high infant mortality rates, overcrowded workhouses and an enduring class system. However, medical improvements and enlightenment, created an optimism, triggering a re-evaluation in paediatric healthcare.","2943","Symposium","Presenter","Charlotte_Waller-Cotterhill",2943,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Symposium",4,"Th-morning"

Results show an increase in nitrogen isotope values suggestive of maternal stress during in utero development between the Archaic and Formative Periods. Additionally, 57% of Formative Period children analysed have carbon isotope values consistent with the use of micronutrient-poor maize-based weaning foods, while Archaic period individuals appear to have been weaned onto marine resources. Paleopathological analysis of individuals from the Archaic (N =72) and Formative (N = 115) Periods shows a significant increase (X2 = 6.667; p = .010) in the prevalence of scurvy (vitamin C deficiency), a disease of low dietary diversity. We discuss these findings in terms of adaptive mechanisms to resource scarcity, maternity, and food allocation.

New incremental isotopic techniques mean that it is now possible to look at individual maternal and infant experiences through tissue chemistry. However, incremental isotopic results are equifinal meaning that multiple interpretations of the data are often possible. This talk will focus on a group (n=5) of incremental isotopic profiles from infants and children from the Inka period site of Camarones 9 in northern Chile. Using these profiles, we will explore how knowledge of the archaeological context, biological factors which may affect isotopic values and consideration of sociocultural theory may allow better interpretation of results. In doing so, we highlight the different maternal and infant experiences seen in individuals from the same archaeological period, and the importance of the individual in archaeology.

We investigated the performances of youth participants making pottery. Three forms of social learning were observed: 1. Participants who made a bowl by copying a pre-made bowl made by the authors, 2. Participants who made a bowl while watching the authors make a bowl, and 3. Participants who made a bowl while the authors made a bowl and described the actions. The results demonstrate patterns of different mental processes, of which caused participants to apply different methods of bowl making. Rather than basing inferences of the past on assumptions of child performance, experimental studies provide a greater opportunity to develop a more concrete understanding of the material indicators that archaeologists identify to assess child performance.

Neighbourhoods like the industrial colony of Parkwood Springs were home to long term residents, and a growing population of families. The city authorities became concerned with the formal education of these children of the industrial city, children of the 'labouring poor'. Built initially for the children – boys, girls, and infants – of men employed in the metal trades, the Neepsend School near Parkwood Springs attracted subscribers from across the city, as well as from within Parkwood itself. The school’s situation, amongst the works of Neepsend, firmly embedded the children’s education within the industrial cityscape. As an institution for the care as well as education, the building was carefully spatially divided and managed, communicating social behaviour as well as industrial training. Employing standing building survey, GIS, and archival research, this paper will examine the site of Neepsend School.

Results indicate there are three situations where feeding practices and health interact: first, the mother’s ability to meet nutritional demands of infants during prolonged breastfeeding; second, undernutrition due to a health insult when the child is losing passive immunity; third, children being weaned on foods lacking protein quality and content when they may already be undernourished.

The papers will enable us to explore the similarities and culturally constructed differences in the ways in which communities and families care for their children, and provide opportunities for them to become social actors.

In many cases, a range of different types of material culture are subsumed into reconstructed connections between nodes. However, not all forms of material culture are equal. Different types of objects may be caught up in rather different forms of social relationship – crudely put, ‘personal’ items such as jewellery may perhaps have more social and cultural significance than commodities, for example functional tools - and may thus be traded/exchanged/gifted in different ways. Analyses including different types of material culture may thus conflate multiple different forms of social relationship and patterns of connection. However, ‘significant’ and ‘functional’ are rarely mutually exclusive categories, and are always fluid, culturally and contextually dependent.

The construction of such network models will be illustrated using radiocarbon data from the Kuril Islands of Northeast Asia. Previous work in this region indicates episodic fluctuations in population density over time, with the breakdown of social networks likely playing a pivotal role in adaptive vulnerability and population decline. By creating a multivariate time series comprising thousands of fine-grained probabilistic networks, we examine long-term trends in network structure in the Kuril archipelago and interpret how these changes relate to demographic transitions.

","Other","Digital Archaeology: Simulation and Modeling","Communities of Practice","This paper uses the Nexus 1492 database, built over approximately 30 years of fieldwork, to examine ceramic attribute variability throughout the Antillean Islands. Regional ceramic analyses often focus on the construction of ceramic typologies that are then used to compare typological proportions, differences, and similarities at various spatial resolutions across temporal periods. Long-standing critiques of the use of typologies and taxonomies in archaeology (sensu Brew 1946; Gnecco and Langebaek 2014; Henry et al. 2017; Wylie 1992) focus on the reifying power of their fixed nature. Essentially, typologies become the epistemologies within which we examine the archaeological record, and create the historical narrative. This can become an issue when we also acknowledge that we interpret the past through our modern framework. Thus, in order to more fully separate ourselves from the analysis of the archaeological record, or to decolonize the analysis of archaeological data (sensu Rizvi 2015), we use a networked approach to examine the distribution of ceramic attributes within and between the Antillean Islands. Our goal is to approach a more emic understanding of how communities of practice emerged and to help construct an indigenous social history prior to, and after, the violent arrival of Europeans.","2942","Symposium","Presenter","Lewis_Borck",2942,1,13,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-morning"

As methods in network analysis advance, the greatest promise for answering questions about the past lies in the ability to bridge approaches and analyze data from micro- to macro-scales. In this session researchers are encouraged to use network-based approaches to examine archaeological systems through multiple lenses and/or multiple scales, moving beyond reporting statistics such as centrality to interpreting their meaning in light of varied approaches. How can combining social and ecological approaches to networks help illuminate past systems? How do empirical and experimental networks differ, and what does this tell us about the past? How does looking at multiple kinds of networks in the same area help to interpret social changes? How can researchers today use quantitative output from network analysis to interpret the past and produce compelling narratives? Ultimately each of these approaches will return to advancing archaeological narratives, helping to interpret long-standing questions in accessible terms, and even using the archaeological record to calibrate our understanding of present and future networks.","2942","Symposium","Chair (Primary)","Stefani_Crabtree",2942,1,13,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-morning"

This request was motivated by a land exchange proposed to congress which would transfer Oak Flat, Forest Service managed land, to Resolution Copper Mine for purposes of ore extraction.  Four years later on March 4, 2016 the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places officially designated Oak Flat a Traditional Cultural Property (TCP). 
The interim four years would test the fortitude of both the Forest Service and the Tribe, as Resolution Copper and other mining supporters would work creatively and persistently to prevent the formal recognition of Oak Flat as a TCP. Politicians, organizations, and even local tribal members rallied to testify to the falsity of Oak Flat’s validity as a TCP. Hundreds of letters of objection to the nomination would cause the Forest Service and the Keeper to weigh the cost versus benefits of recognizing the cultural paradigms of the Apache people.  In this paper, I will examine the nomination process of this highly contested TCP, the interference, the perseverance, and the outcome.

By definition, it is reducing the severity, seriousness, or painfulness of an event, development, procedure, or situation. As part of CRM mitigation processes, direct, indirect, and cumulative effects must all be identified in order to address any competent approach to and for mitigation. A key question must then also arise within any mitigation process – by whom is mitigation developed and implemented and for what and whose interests, concerns, benefits, and well-being? The bureaucratic recognition of TCPs in Bulletin 38 and in 1992 amendments to the National Historic Preservation Act have provided productive directives to identify and consider properties vital to different cultural groups. These directives have concomitantly presented a challenge to consider what sound mitigation may—or may not—be, as the significance of such places are defined far more by their integrity of associative relations. Avoidance is the mutually acceptable form of mitigation by tribes, agencies, industry and the CRM community; however, when it is agreed by all parties that avoidance is not feasible, we present examples from our experiences working with the Zuni of how cumulative effects and the Zuni worldview and associated cultural practices, must be considered and applied in the design of successful mitigation.","2940","Symposium","Presenter","Kurt E._Dongoske",2940,1,10,"11","2.75",NA,"Symposium",2.75,"Th-morning"

Perhaps most importantly, the identification and consideration of traditional cultural properties requires meaningful consultation and collaboration between federal agencies and traditional communities.

More than twenty-five years have passed since traditional cultural properties were first defined in National Register Bulletin 38 in 1990. Since then, there has been substantial effort in the southwestern United States to develop protocols for identification and management of historic properties whose significance comes from the role they play in the retention and transmission of traditional beliefs and practices. As Patricia L. Parker emphasized, “It is necessary to try to understand traditional places through the eyes of those who value them.” Doing this requires collaborative efforts between researchers and traditional communities, and it necessitates new approaches to management and mitigation of adverse effects by federal agencies. Perspectives on current issues in the research and management of traditional cultural properties are presented from people working for tribal, federal, and state agencies, and in the private sector.

The native Amazonian population built an anthropogenic landscape through the creation of causeways, well or ponds away from rivers, raised fields, earthworks, large settlement mounds, Amazonian dark Earth soils and anthropogenic forest. When the Europeans arrived in the Americas, large and diverse groups of people with extensive networks of communication and hierarchical social-political organization had developed across the Amazon, and they had been constantly manipulating and managing the landscape to meet their everyday needs.

This introductory paper will summarize past and current perceptions of Maya urbanism, emphasizing potentially overshadowed considerations of urban planning, mobility, and community dynamics – fundamental cross-cultural features of urbanization – and their detection in lowland settlement patterns.
The recent florescence of research deriving insight from urban theory has been positive as it reminds scholars that Maya cities were urban phenomena, not simply political capitals, and must be treated as such. But the trend to emphasize monumentality in urban layout continues, to the near exclusion of other processes critical to urbanization, such as mobility, neighborhood community building, and resource management. There is a strong need for increased residential excavations across Classic urban landscapes, and we should be prepared to develop audacious programs following recent LiDAR surveys. Maya urbanism was a complex mesh of social, economic, ritual, and political networks, balanced between potentially conflicting household and social group loyalties, resulting in changing urban structures through time and space. It will require a long-term disciplinary commitment to household and neighborhood excavations to fully uncover the temporal and regional dynamics of Classic Maya urban systems.","2935","Symposium","Presenter","Damien_Marken",2935,0,14,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-morning"

At Naachtun, extensive excavation programs carried out in monumental Group B, a compact set of three large elite clusters of residential compounds located in the site epicenter, and intensive test-pitting programs applied to the residential zones which surround the monumental core, have enabled us to understand the site occupation development during the Classic phases. We identify contraction, dispersal and expansion where and when most households units were occupied. We compare these space-time dynamics in epicentral Group B and surrounding urban residential zones, explore their articulation, and discuss possible intra-site population mobility. Although some of the dynamics resulted from royal-court elite attraction and urban planning, the permanence of a dense, post-dynastic occupation, and new housing practices in Group B indicate that people did not need rulers’ coercion to organize and modify their settlement in accordance with what they perceived to be their socioeconomic interests.

One, it shows the urban landscape to be in a continuously changing state. The urban ruins encountered by researchers are the end product of centuries of such shifting settlement and rarely reflect contemporaneous occupation. Two, urban and hinterland communities across the city likely display a variable degree of mobility through time. The El Peru communities described in this paper appear to originate elsewhere and, after abandonment, migrate again. The shifting settlement reflects not just change over time, but mobility, a fundamental dynamic in urban settlement patterns.

The Buenavista Valley, largely controlled during the Classic period by the kingdom of El Zotz, extends out west from the great city of Tikal. However, the Preclassic city of El Palmar preceded this kingdom, established by the first lowland settlers on the western edge of a large wetland. Originally considered a minor site, LiDAR data reveals that El Palmar was in fact a sizeable early community that would have rivaled the emerging kingdom at Tikal. El Palmar was suddenly abandoned between AD 100-200 and a century later, elite settlements emerged on heavily fortified, escarpment edge hilltops. The pervasive Preclassic residential platforms on the valley floor were never matched during the Classic period. Household construction techniques varied by elevation during the Classic period, suggesting that the geopolitical interactions of the local dynasty at El Zotz did in fact affect the greater population and not simply elites.","2935","Symposium","Presenter","Thomas_Garrison",2935,0,14,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-morning"

Emphasizing livelihoods and opportunities, the key purpose of the paper is to shift discussions in the Maya lowlands from generalized theory of urbanization, including obsolete urban and rural dichotomies, to household provisioning of food, resources, and ecosystem services.

Obviously, this is an oversimplification of a much more complex real scenario , nevertheless I consider this simple dichotomy an interesting one, mainly, because it highlights, I think, an important methodological issue: as archaeologists involved in understanding the social logic of ancient Maya urban settings, we should be able to differentiate between urban infrastructure (needed to maintain the necessary minimum conditions for human populations to thrive) and urban programs that aim to satisfy personal agendas (political or ideological in nature) in order to begin a truly comparative study of Maya urbanism and its lessons for contemporary societies.

Recently, debate has shifted from largely demographic factors to the design and planning behind Maya urban layouts. While a welcome advance for the field, design theory in the Maya lowlands has often emphasized top-down processes of dynastic intent and meaning within monumental cores, to the near exclusion of bottom-up local, regional, and hinterland processes of settlement and community adaptation, mobility, and interaction in creating the broader low-density urban forms recorded by archaeologists. Maya towns and cities were not only central places resulting from “place-making” regal policies, but also, and even primarily, were urban entities with their own internal dynamics in relation to their hinterlands.
This session will offer a broadened perspective of Maya urban design and planning, viewing bottom-up and self-organizing processes, such as household decision-making and neighborhood clustering, dispersal/contraction as integral to the development and dissolution of Classic lowland cities.

Ancient DNA research has advanced so much that genomic data from thousands of individuals across the globe are now available for study. These data are allowing geneticists and archaeologists to conduct studies that provide new insights into migration, demographic transitions, and relatedness of ancient individuals. They also afford an entirely new dataset to examine longstanding archaeological questions. While aDNA analysis is having a significant impact on interpretation of the past, due to the very rapid growth and development of the field, archaeologists might find themselves falling behind on increasingly complex methods and numerous publications. Thus, I provide a brief overview on the process of aDNA research. Additionally, this paper addresses some of the recent controversies in aDNA studies, such as “sample hoarding,” the seeming focus on European samples, and ethical issues surrounding aDNA analysis. Finally, while there certainly have been many fruitful collaborations between archaeologists and geneticists, there have also been disagreements about results and data interpretation. I therefore also examine how archaeologists and geneticists can better collaborate in future research.

These two factors contributed to the low-density nature of Maya cities, and conditioned urban form and the structure of neighborhoods and districts. The requirements of top-down administration resulted in the creation of districts to delineate areas of provisioning for the city’s urban services. However, a variety of interactions between top-down and bottom-up processes create neighborhoods, especially when they occur in areas of frequent, repeated face-to-face interaction between residents. The use of neighborhoods and districts as scales of analysis permits analysis of various concepts, including: urban infrastructural power, collective action among urban residents, household autonomy within the city, and other concepts that span the spectrum from top-down to bottom-up administrative processes. While districts at Caracol can be reconstructed through the spatial distribution of architectural features that would have provisioned urban services, no such architectural features occur uniquely at the neighborhood scale.

Next, they move to consider the relationship between neighborhoods and such authorities. Researchers typically see this relationship as one of domination, independence, or something in between. The case of Chunchucmil, a large Maya site located in northwest Yucatan, Mexico, challenges this common approach to neighborhood integration. At Chunchucmil, neighborhoods are clearly defined but centralized authority is not. Thus, we must set aside the question of neighborhoods being weakly or strongly integrated with centralized authority and instead ask how neighborhoods constitute authority itself. In a densely populated, decentralized city, how can neighborhoods be seen as factions whose competition and cooperation produce authority? This paper explores this question while also discussing everyday processes that hold neighborhoods together, cases in which households could switch ties from one neighborhood to another, and the foundations of inequality within neighborhoods and hierarchy between them.","2931","Symposium","Presenter","Jacob_Welch",2931,0,14,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-morning"

In some ancient cities, the urban periphery appeared as autonomous communities prior to the development of a center, representing an ‘outside-in’ model of urbanism. Such contexts provide a valuable case study for investigating neighborhood integration into cities, due to a clear comparative temporal threshold (before and after incorporation). This presentation explores how a small community transitioned into a low density urban neighborhood in a larger city, and how the local elites at its apex transformed into intermediate elites in an emergent three tier political system. The Late-Terminal Classic (AD 700-900) Maya polity of Lower Dover, Belize offers potential for examining this issue because the center arose in the midst of several long-established, Middle Preclassic (1000-400 BC) communities. This presentation identifies the ways in which the lives of the inhabitants of the Tutu Uitz Na neighborhood changed during the Late Classic as it transitioned from an autonomous community to become amalgamated into a polity. A focus on the changing wealth, status and behavior of inhabitants permits an understanding of how the neighborhood became incorporated politically, economically, ritually and socially.","2931","Symposium","Presenter","John_Walden",2931,0,14,"14","3.5",NA,"Symposium",3.5,"Th-morning"

Most of these centers were organized around clusters of walled enclosures with duplicate domestic facilities interpreted as multi-functional residential complexes, or compounds.

Depending on their scale and complexity, some of the compounds can be considered neighborhoods. In this paper, we explore what the neighborhood concept entails for these groups in terms of sociopolitical organization through a review of Early Horizon excavation and settlement pattern data. Major variables include: “compact” and “dispersed” architectural patterns; ephemeral, generational, and multi-generational architectural scales ; access patterns ; life cycles of compounds ; and material patterns of use.

I argue that the intermediate scale of the neighborhood is best suited for analyzing how local- and state-level power structures intermix on the ground. Neighborhoods within cities capture both the everyday life of a diversity of residents, and articulate with larger state institutions and political economy. While the dynamic model is now widely accepted, very few studies show how state actors and local people actually navigate growing and waning power levels. I operationalize such dynamics through the lens of Collective Action Theory, which specifically addresses the role of state actors in the everyday life of local residents through the concept of infrastructural power.

Small villages faced the possibility of effective, long-range attacks that could potentially lead to the quick application of overwhelming force on unprepared villages. To address this potential, settlements moved to less productive upland locations with inter-visible settlement clusters that provided for mutual defense through defense in layers. As agriculture became better established, this pattern of defense again changed as people nucleated into larger sites in highly productive, lowland areas. Defense was still a significant consideration as reflected in both the selection of defensible topographic settings and the apparent creation of a borderland along the river. The larger number of people in each village provided safety in numbers and decreased the likelihood of overwhelming attacks.

This presentation utilizes geostatistical analyses of architectural and topographical features to reconstruct defensive coping mechanisms among LIP groups living in 12 fortified settlements in the southern Nasca highlands of Peru. Analytical results reveal a regional defensive pattern whereby the smallest most vulnerable groups invested the most in fortifications and occupied the least accessible hilltops. Variation in fortification investment within each site was driven by differences in the accessibility of approaches leading to a site’s residential sector. This research demonstrates that LIP populations made optimal trade-offs between competing defensive variables, revealing highly patterned regional defensive strategies that vary from defensive practices observed in other LIP regions. This variation is likely the result of groups implementing defensive strategies to cope with local patterns of warfare.

Drawing on research from the Ica Highlands (South-central Peru) and the Cordillera Negra (North-central Peru) this paper examines how Spanish religious orders initially occupied sacred indigenous sites, linking them directly to local cosmological landscapes. With time, the contradiction between an externalized (Andean – animated landscape) and an internalized (Christian – church) system of worship amid growing Spanish hegemony called for a renegotiation of this earlier modos operandi. In turn, this lead to the abandonment of early church sites, in favor of churches in new town reducciones – imperial settlements which concentrated a declining indigenous population in more accessible areas – that led to a disconnect with the earlier Andean landscape. Nevertheless, the resulting Andean church was always syncretic, for instance, combining Christian saints with Andean deities, and local pilgrimage routes that directly evoked earlier indigenous sacred sites. Here we analyze the changing nature of this emergent syncretism.","2929","Electronic Symposium","Presenter","Kevin_Lane",2929,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Electronic Symposium",4,"Th-morning"

Its shores were inhabited by mestizos, mulattos, slaves, and free slaves, with a minority of Indians and Spaniards. While this area was mined for gold and offered one of few routes to the Pacific from Colombia’s interior, the Dagua River region was largely cut off from global trade and colonial currents due to its geographical remoteness. 50 days distant from Cartagena and 14 from the nearest town, Cali, it was just beyond the reach of Spanish colonial authorities. 

For the Dagua’s largely self-governing and self-sustaining inhabitants, including African slaves, topographical challenges such as steep cordilleras, dense tropical jungles, and torrential rivers gave rise to social, cultural, and economic opportunities. Spaniards, who theoretically were in control as hacendados, merchants, and miners, depended on forasteros—French doctors, Italian notaries, and African slaves. African slaves in the Dagua region came to wield great power and autonomy, controlling terrestrial and river commerce, effectively fighting royal aguardiente and tobacco monopolies, buying their freedom, and building free slave communities. Their descendants would inhabit this area into the early twentieth century. Methods are art historical, historical, cartographic, and ethnographic.

Indigenous peoples were put to work in the goldmines and farms of Hispaniola, Cuba and Puerto Rico or in the pearl fisheries in Cubagua. On the other hand, in the Greater Antilles the encomienda system generated an intensive exploitation that disarticulated the indigenous societies and transformed their sociocultural practices. The influence of a forced African diaspora, and the concomitant Amerindian-African-European inter-cultural dynamics at play changed the indigenous Caribbean islandscape forever. The impact of these initial acts of colonialism and the role played by the Amerindian populations in the colonial process are often discounted for and remain up until today a far neglected chapter in global history.

","Historic","Ethnohistory/History","Colonialism","The shift to wet-rice cultivation and construction of rice terraces in Ifugao, Philippines has recently been associated with Spanish colonization. Previously thought to be at least 2,000 years old, investigations in the region have now established that wet-rice cultivation was a response of highland populations to the Spanish conquest at ca. 1650 CE.  The shift to an intensive cultivation drastically changed Ifugao social organization that allowed them to successfully resist multiple attempts of the Spanish to place them under the colonial administration.   Contemporary Ifugao identity is based on the narrative of being uncolonized as well as centered on wet-rice cultivation.  Even when the market economy exerts pressure on the agricultural system, Ifugao families endeavor to continue producing wet-rice and sponsor rice-planting rituals.  The persistence of wet-rice farming and rice rituals are interpreted as an active resistance of the Ifugao against assimilation to the larger Philippine society and conscious acts of maintaining their identity.  Utilizing archaeological, ethnographic, spatial, productivity, and energetics data associated with wet-rice cultivation, this presentation aims to illustrate the continuity of Ifugao struggle against hegemonic cultures.  As such, we show that resistance against Spanish colonialism became the foundation of Ifugao identity and resistance continues in the present.","2929","Electronic Symposium","Presenter","Stephen_Acabado",2929,0,16,"16","4",NA,"Electronic Symposium",4,"Th-morning"

An indigenous town of several hundred resettled Mexican auxiliaries and their families located in the village of Almolonga or “Ciudad Vieja,” grew up about two kilometers to the west.

Despite repeated historical retelling, little attention has been paid to the structures of the cross-cultural encounters described in the original narratives. Ethno-historical analysis reveals an extraordinary diversity of responses in these interactions, from prosaic trading, through to wilful acts of physical and sexual aggression, and highly charged spiritual contests. While the Spanish presence was largely ephemeral, with even the nascent colonies lasting only several weeks, the sometimes dramatic shifts in status from transitory explorer, to colonist, to survivor often resulted in similarly significant transformations in relations with indigenous groups. Beyond the documentary record, the archaeological record also shows evidence of longer-term repercussions and attempts by indigenous groups to mitigate these transitory exchanges.

While inescapably nested in European nationalist agendas and global economy, the cultural exchanges of Portugal and Spain in Africa were characterized more by variability than by unitary templates, more by persistence than hegemonic change.

He encouraged me to study the megafaunal bones from those sites, and gave me room to disagree with him. His support allowed me to start looking into new ways to understand how the bones were modified and how such sites came to be. This presentation ties together data from those fossil sites with results of my actualistic research on megafaunal bones, starting with carnivore feedings at the National Zoo, and moving on to field studies of modern bonesites in North America, Australia, and Africa. Thanks to Dennis, critically important lessons have been learned about megafaunal bone assemblages. For example, we know that noncultural processes can spirally break proboscidean bones in ways that may be mistaken for human-caused fracturing, and that mortality profiles of multi-mammoth assemblages may reflect causes of death. Mammoths and other proboscideans feature prominently in debates about the evolution of human abilities to exploit large mammals, and Dennis Stanford has done much to advance the state of our knowledge.","2928","Symposium","Presenter","Gary_Haynes",2928,1,12,"13","3.25",NA,"Symposium",3.25,"Th-morning"

Learning to be an archaeologist is a craft that comes in many forms from formal academic training, field and lab work, to informal unstructured experiences.  These become known through academic degrees, peer reviewed publications, project reports, conference presentations and interactions with peers, colleagues, the public and even the media. Formal training is listed in detail in personal vitae and may be measured and judged by the outputs but how we do archaeology as individuals is also the result of our personal experiences, not least of which are the projects we work on and the people with whom we work and interact.  Legends of the Dinsmore Hilton chronicle these experiences. To date, these are primarily in the form of oral tradition as many of the participants are still extant and written versions might be subject to civil suits.  As time passes my memory becomes ever more selective and inventive.  Never the less, working for and with Dennis on the High Plains of Eastern Colorado in the mid-1970s has had a fundamental influence on who I have become as an archaeologist and person.

Following brief investigations at the Utkiavik site, he focused his excavations south of Barrow at Walakpa, where he discovered more than 20 stratigraphic levels documenting the transition from Birnirk to Thule cultures.  His analysis led him to conclude that the transition from Birnirk to Thule was correlated to climate change and possibly an over-reliance on seal hunting.  His subsequent research interest in Alaska have focused the relationships between eastern Beringia and the first colonization of the Americas.  In 1989-90 he served as Visiting Distinguished Professor, at the Alaskan Quaternary Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks where he taught Paleoindian archeology and mentored students.

This exploratory work also identified, in a variety of stratigraphic contexts, an extensive ancestral Native American shell mound that was occupied throughout most, if not all, of the Late Holocene. Sea level reconstruction indicates that the oldest site component was formed just above the tidal range at the time of occupation, was subsequently submerged, and is now situated over 6 meters below surface and overlain by estuarine mud. In response to progressively rising sea levels, later temporal components of this shell mound were formed at increasingly higher elevations. Paleoenvironmental analysis of diatoms and pollen reveal that during the Middle Holocene this estuary was largely freshwater, and transitioned to brackish conditions beginning around 5000 years ago.

Here, using an argument drawn from New Guinea ethnography, we hypothesize that some Maine middens were not simply rubbish heaps, but conspicuous constructions that, among other things, maintained peace among neighboring aboriginal polities. 
Behavioral ecologists theorize that, as honest signals of fighting strength, threat displays and ritualized fighting are information-gathering devices that allow both parties to a conflict to establish the victor without either having to risk the potentially catastrophic costs of serious fighting (Enquist and Leimar 1990). Analogously, we propose, some Maine shell middens were indexical signals of a polity’s fighting strength that helped maintain peace by mediating inter-polity conflict. As signals of consumption, scale of feasting, and available food resources, the middens broadcast the number of members and allies a polity could muster, as well as their commitment to its projects. The hypothesis gains support from the distribution of both middens and their contents.

These aboriginal accumulations contain centimeters to meters of mollusk shells and frequently include artifacts and other faunal remains.

The buffering effect of the decomposition of carbonate shells yields preservation of organic artifacts that are often not preserved in other settings. Additionally, climate-change driven sea-level rise threatens many of these valuable cultural and paleoenvironmental archives. This session invites presentations that describe various aspects of shell midden investigations; shell midden formational processes, potential functions of shell middens, interpretations of shell midden contents, noninvasive remote sensing techniques applied to shell middens, and monitoring and rescue strategies that seek to protect the valuable information contained in these important archaeological features.

To cite a solitary example, the teaming of marine archaeologist Colin Martin and historian Geoffrey Parker in evaluating artifacts recovered from wrecks of the Spanish Armada (1588) altered the courses of the military revolution debate and the relatively new theoretical fields of counterfactuals and virtual history (in the latter cases perhaps a fortuitous intersection of archaeology and postmodernism).

A maritime landscape approach draws on the “lure of the sea” that attracts many people to shipwreck studies, but engages larger constituencies through place-based history. Geographic space is one of the things that all people share and maritime landscapes loom large for many cultures due to the power, beauty, bounty, danger, and opportunity that water bodies hold. Maritime landscapes also allow for alternative histories to exist in the same space because landscapes are interpreted through a cultural lens. Groups that may be disenfranchised by the colonial histories often associated with shipwrecks can connect with maritime archaeology through the physical remains of their ancestors’ maritime occupations and beliefs.

At that time, sea levels had fallen approximately 100 m and people utilized a pond in the bottom of a sinkhole that was located ca. 250 km inland from the coast.  Subsequent sea level rise slowly submerged the site, 4 m of sediment buried the site, and the sinkhole became part of the Aucilla River channel.  This scenario was repeated at multiple sites, creating a rich underwater record of archaeological sites dating to the Late Pleistocene in Northwest Florida.  These submerged sites are critically important to First American studies because they occur in a secure geological context that can be dated by the radiocarbon method.
