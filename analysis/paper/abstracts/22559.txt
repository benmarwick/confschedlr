northern ohio is the intersection of several physiographic zones and drainage sub basins. where the eastern edge of the dissected allegheny plateau meets the broad till and lake plains of western ohio, the difference in the landscape is apparent. between 2015 and 2017, swca, worked to complete a 217-mile survey across northern ohio for a large natural gas pipeline project. the project investigated almost 10,000 acres, and recorded close to 500 archaeological resources. the dataset generated through this extensive survey provides a detailed look at the prehistoric landscape of northern ohio. when combined with previously recorded sites and the results of other similar linear projects, the information generated by the project provides an excellent data set to compare prehistoric settlement patterns between physiographic provinces as well as identifying key features in the prehistoric landscape. with the increased development of natural gas infrastructure in the region, the authors’ hope is to highlight the science being conducted behind the development and to convey the results of the archaeology being performed to the professional community.
