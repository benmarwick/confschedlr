rock art panels in the american southwest contain defining markers of archaic, hohokam, anasazi, fremont and historic ute social practices. this paper will employ archaeological social theory and various communication theories to decode tribal information, including identity, that indigenous people recorded on rock surfaces.

through case study analysis of particular physical characteristics for several rock art panels, this paper will analyze their potential applications as ancient communication platforms.  it will compare, as evidence, shared characteristics between modern and ancient aboriginal cultures, such as matriarchal social values; religious practices, including dance ceremonies and pilgrimage rituals; and political identity formation via the development of tribal states.

this paper will use linguistics and semiotics theories to illustrate ways in which indigenous rock art sites may have:

1) showcased tribal council leadership through defined characterizations of political and social roles;

2) instructed populations in visual communication literacy to publicize and interpret significant events;

3) cultivated tribal thinking to encourage conformity through social and ceremonial participation; and

4) displayed advancements in technological communication.

assessing rock art through the lens of archaeological social theory and various communications theories can provide unique insights into the social practices that defined ancient indigenous life in the american southwest.
