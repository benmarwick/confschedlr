Evidence of stratigraphic layering, however, is an indication of a slow mound construction over centuries. Gaining insight of the construction style and timeline of Mound A will lead to an improved understanding of the site. Mound Builders have been known to cap mounds built in stages. If Mound A was built in stages it is likely capped with some more dense material than the dirt surrounding it.

To reconstruct everyday life I am using excavated ceramic refuse to observe dynamics surrounding three households. This, in turn, elucidates elements of La Blanca’s political economy associated with the manufacturing and production of ceramics. To observe this I am adapting Dickinson’s methods of mapping interaction spheres using petrography to a household level. Reviews of local geologic sources and 90 sherds have been collected. Petrographic examination of sherds has shown three distinct compositional groups: Mineralic, Volcanic, and Vitric. From these groups, representative samples have been selected and point counted using the Gazzi-Dickinson method. To correlate sherd samples to potential sources, three modern sands were sampled and seven Paleo sands from the Missouri University Research Reactor were provided. These samples were analyzed using the same methods as the sherds. Preliminary results indicate a local geologic provenance for raw materials and varied clay sources and manufacturing techniques among households. This suggests that each household was producing their own ceramics and trading amongst themselves.",3118,"John_Lawrence","Th-afternoon"

I present a methodology for the efficient and cost-effective analysis of Iroquoian ceramic fabrics applicable to ceramic pots and pipes. The attributes selected and methods for recording them are developed using insights from petrographic analysis of ceramic thin sections using a polarizing microscope following Whitbread’s (1989) methodology. By focusing on characteristics diagnostic of specific technological and provenance related characteristics of ceramic fabrics that are evident using a standard binocular microscope, this methodology is designed to be used and refined in conjunction with selective petrographic analysis.

The results of these analyses ultimately suggest that Safford Mound maintained its social power during a period of immense sociopolitical realignment and reorganization.

Three reservoirs are located on Park Mesa in Mesa Verde National Park. These were originally documented during surveys in the 1970s and revisited after the Chapin 5 fire in 1996, but none have been analyzed beyond basic description. In July 2017, two of the largest villages on Park Mesa were re-mapped as a part of the Community Center Reassessment Project, including one apparently centered around the Horseshoe Ridge Reservoir (HRR; 5MV03629). We examine the social and ecological contexts of the HRR community to understand more fully the development and organization of occupation on Park Mesa. We calculate least cost paths and viewsheds in order to help define the extent of the Horseshoe Ridge community and situate it within the broader social landscape. We also evaluate ecological setting, including potential sediment and surface hydrology, to assess the agricultural potential provided by this supposed water catchment feature. We compare the HRR community to other reservoir communities on the Mesa Verde cuesta.",3095,"Katherine_Portman","Th-afternoon"

Although most caves and rock shelters probably served as logistical and/or cache locations throughout prehistory, the substantial TP/EH archaeological deposits recovered from Fort Rock Cave, Cougar Mountain Cave, and the Connley Caves suggest residential occupations.

We argue that the Prearchaic cannot be understood by direct analogy with ethnographic Great Basin foragers because they lived in climatic circumstances and at population densities utterly unlike those of recent times.

The classifier uses these features: eccentricity of the arrowhead, blade kind (excurvate-incurvate) and base kind (concave-curvate, straight, with handle, and concave with handle). Except for the eccentricity, the other features were obtained by the curvature scale space (CSS) method computed on the arrowhead contour.

Ancient classical texts present a picture of deep, long-term hostility between them, as well as with the indigenous population.

This study used complete mitogenomes from ancient guinea pigs as a commensal model to identify likely human migration routes and interaction spheres within the Caribbean region. Possible origins of early historic European and North American guinea pigs were also determined. Complete mitogenomes of 23 ancient and two modern guinea pigs were obtained. The identified haplogroups indicate that two introductions of guinea pigs to the Caribbean likely occurred, both from Peru, to Puerto Rico (AD500) and the Lesser Antilles (AD1000). A potential origin for historic European domestic guinea pigs was identified as the Andean region encompassing Peru and Bolivia. A historic period North American guinea pig was found to have likely come from Peru.

These classes are considered temporally and contextually, across spatially distinct walled administrative districts and proposed social neighborhoods within these walled mounds. The relationships of the tool classes between and within the mounds were evaluated via correspondence analysis. Each of the districts is found to have a limited repetition of crafts, suggesting that some level of economic integration was a factor that contributed to the cohesion of this decentralized urban center.

Although much of the area we covered lacked clear evidence of human prehistory, we found several locations that merit further investigation. One exposed soil profile contained a large bovid humerus, a long bone shaft fragment with apparent green fractures, and two stone flakes. In addition to foot and vehicle survey, we consulted with local residents in many of the small villages we encountered. A resident of the village Balgyn led us to a small cave, in which he says he had found “arrowheads.” This informant also told us there was a larger cave in the area, which we will investigate next season.

More specifically, a network analysis is used to determine whether there are discernible patterns in the geographic distribution of marine shells used for the creation of beads and pendants. As early inhabitants of Europe moved across the landscape they came into contact with others and left behind material traces of these interactions. Whether these artifacts came to be deposited through processes of migration or exchange, marine shells are particularly useful for exploring these processes, as their presence far from the sea can be indicative of dynamic interactions between materials, individuals, and groups.
Through the use of social network analysis software called Gephi, this research visually maps the interactions between sites and regions based on the genera of marine shells present. By creating network visualizations that are analyzed mathematically, in addition to geographic maps of site locations, patterns in the interactions within which materials and people were embedded and entangled are explored.

Despite its importance fuel use in the Arctic and Subarctic has received relatively little attention. Work currently underway aims to clarify the criteria used to select fuel in ancient Alaska by testing two hypotheses. The Efficiency Maximization hypothesis, derived from the prey choice model of human behavioral ecology, proposes that Alaskans ranked woody taxa according to net energy acquisition, and preferentially selected highly ranked taxa. The Firewood Indifference hypothesis proposes that Alaskans were not selective but rather sought to minimize the energy and time expended gathering firewood without regard for the specific properties of different taxa. This pattern is predicted by the prevailing fuel use model, the “Principle of Least Effort” (PLE), but is at odds with ethnography, which indicates that Native Alaskans discriminate between and seek specific wood(s) with preferred properties.

This immense empire operated primarily on two institutions: the crown and the sangha (Buddhist monkhood). Kutho (merit) was arguably one of the most important Buddhist doctrines in Bagan as it was believed to guarantee better social status upon reincarnation. Kutho, for the elite, was most commonly obtained by contributing large donations to the sangha. These donations took the form of labourers, tax-free lands, or precious materials that were used for the construction of temples and monasteries, of which thousands continue to survive today. The construction of these buildings would have displaced a sizeable amount of the commoner population whilst also establishing new settlements. Despite the extensive archaeological potential in this region, no settlement studies have been conducted in Myanmar. Through inscriptions, murals, and ground survey along with the application of entanglement theory, this study will determine how the crown and the sangha worked together influencing the settlement patterns of the commoner population.

","Paleoindian and Paleoamerican","Lithic Analysis","Mobility","This poster addresses an understudied area relevant to the initial peopling of the Americas: what are the earliest indications of human activity in Mesoamerica (particular emphasis on Guatemala)? Its geographic location and its relatively narrow expanse, makes the southern half of Middle America the natural stage to funnel terrestrial and coastal/riverine routes of early human migrations. Despite this consideration, archaeological research targeting Paleoamerican horizons [pre-12,800 BP] in this area has only witnessed intermittent treatment, in part due to a rich tradition intensely focused in Maya archaeology, mainly in Guatemala and Belize. An intriguing aspect of the Paleo-Central American legacy is the coexistence of two great contemporary lithic traditions of the American continent: South American “Fishtail” points and North American Clovis assemblages.  This may suggests that Central America was a zone of technological innovation where traditions merged. A preliminary analysis of available fluted points from Central America vs. North American Clovis, points to an expansion of this technocomplex at least as far as Venezuela. Moreover, morphological similarities between Central American lanceolate points and Clovis collections from the U.S. South-Eastern/Gulf regions indicate that a set of cultural connections may have existed along a now submerged Late Pleistocene Atlantic coast.",44,"Mario_Giron-Ábrego","Fr-afternoon"

While previous researchers demonstrated the efficacy of this approach regarding the peopling of a landscape, there remains a need to demonstrate how the model can shed light on the spread of ideas.  In this study, we seek to test if the dispersal of prismatic blade technology throughout Mesoamerica occurred as a wave-of-dispersal.

Next, we developed general rates at which we predict ideas to have spread based on ethnographic data. Finally, we analyzed the database information and the predicted rates together, testing the validity of using a wave-of-advance model for predict the spread of blade technology.

By the mid-20th century, scholars acknowledged that the ancient Maya produced these incised images.

Integral to the study of social interaction and the emergence of Chupadero Black-on-white ceramics is the nature of the pithouse-to-pueblo transition in each region.  Prior to the emergence of pueblo architecture, populations in Salinas lived in pithouses and used predominantly brownware ceramics. The gradual shift to above-ground architecture in the area coincided with a marked increase in the abundances of Chupadero Black-on-white. Similarly, while the shift out of pithouses occurred sporadically in the Jornada Mogollon world, those sites that eventually shifted to above-ground architecture frequently display higher quantities of Chupadero Black-on-white.

Our goals are twofold. First, we examine microartifacts from four different feature morphologies (which vary in shape and size) to see if the micro debris reflects differences in what was cooked and/or how foods were cooked over time. We then integrate the microartifact data with previously published faunal and experimental results. Second, we advocate for taking a more robust approach to microartifact data analyses to include ubiquity and diversity measures in addition to the more commonly used density measures of comparison.

Recently, archaeologists have actively worked with descendants in this research, including excavation and archaeological interpretation. However, little has been done to build the connection between biological and historical heritages of enslaved people and their descendants. In this study, we utilized ancient DNA methodology to contextualize the maternal ancestry of three teeth that were discovered at James Madison’s Montpelier. The teeth were recovered from non-burial contexts associated with enslaved people living and working at Montpelier during the 18th and 19th centuries. Before DNA extraction, the teeth were 3-D scanned and printed to preserve their morphology in digital form. The genetic analysis of the tooth remains not only expands the breadth of knowledge about slavery in the US, but also provides an opportunity for archaeologists and a community of descendants from Montpelier to collaborate in a new way. Therefore, this study illustrates how the knowledge from a genetic study can be of value to both the academic and public settings.",35,"Sterling_Wright","Th-morning"

Tipu is a borderland town largely occupied from AD 1541-1704. Baking Pot was a regional civic-ceremonial center continuously occupied from the Late Preclassic (~400 cal BC) to the Terminal Classic periods (cal AD 800-900), and later reoccupied during the Late Postclassic (cal AD 1280-1420).
Oral “health” and carbon and nitrogen isotopic values were assessed from skeletal samples. Baking Pot bone collagen isotopes are lighter than Tipu (-11 ( +1.0) and -9.8 ( +1.4), respectively), suggesting slightly more consumption of C3 foods. Apatite supports a greater consumption of C3 foods at Baking Pot -6.6 ( +0.6) compared to Tipu -5.3 ( +1.4). Nitrogen values are the same, Tipu +9.2 ( +0.8) and Baking Pot +9.2 ( +1.3). Isotopic values are indicative of a diet of marine fish and maize at both sites. Oral conditions vary. By tooth count, Baking Pot has more instances of caries compared to Tipu, but more individuals from Tipu experienced tooth loss during life. The differential dietary patterns are reflective of varying oral condition frequency and overall oral “health.”

Thus, we can expect that many technological traits of vessels such as temper, wall thickness, porosity, firing temperature, and manufacturing techniques will be systematically shaped by local performance conditions. One key dimension of variability that is directly associated with the performance of vessels to cook food is thermal conductivity: the rate at which heat is transferred from one side of the vessel wall to the other.

Poster Abstract

Pottery manufacturing in Early Bronze Age (EBA) Anatolia witnessed a host of technical innovations that transformed what had been a small-scale domestic activity into a specialist craft. At the proto-urban village of Seyitömer Höyük, dedicated pottery workshops appeared in the EBIII period (ca. 2250-2200 BCE), along with a suite of technical innovations, such as pottery molds, clay mixing pits, and clusters of pottery kilns. These advances allowed potters to manufacture more vessels with less effort, and represent a fundamental shift in the chaine operatoire, which is indicative of broader social and economic changes in the EBA. This poster presents the archaeological evidence for various stages of standardized pottery production, in comic book style. Sequential illustrations tell the story of an apprentice potter learning her craft under the tutelage of a seasoned corporate group of specialists. These fictional characters perform activities that are empirically attested at Seyitömer Höyük, and offer an approachable way for general audiences to engage with real archaeological data.

The site is located outside the modern city of Moquegua in the Moquegua Valley of southern Peru and was likely established as a Lupaqa colony settlement during the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1100-1476); a period characterized by regional development and political transition throughout much of Andean South America. Preliminary results suggest that there is a difference in cortisol levels in juveniles (18-64±19 ng/g) compared to adults (150-248±68 ng/g) and clinical data (104-134±40 ng/g). This exploratory research suggests that the variation in cortisol levels at Estuquiña differs based on sex and pre- and post- pubertal development at time of death.",32,"Benjamin_Schaefer","Th-morning"

These studies indicated that residents consumed large quantities of shellfish and marine fish during both the Formative and Regional Development periods (2800 BC – 700 AD), with a marked decrease and differential access based on socioeconomic status in the later period. It has been hypothesized that site residents increased their reliance on domesticated plant foods, especially maize, in order to compensate for decreased consumption of marine foods. While no physical evidence for maize has been found, there exists a chance for bias based on poor preservation and sampling. 

In order to better address dietary practices at the site and test the maize hypothesis, stable isotope and elemental analysis of 16 elite and non-elite individuals from the Regional Development period were conducted. Bone collagen carbon and nitrogen, and bone apatite and tooth enamel carbon and oxygen isotope ratios were determined, along with calcium, strontium, and barium elemental values.The isotopic results reinforce previous conclusions concerning diet at El Dornajo, including the lack of evidence for maize. We, therefore, conclude that any increased reliance on plant foods focused on other indigenous plant resources.

To estimate age-at-death, the long bones and basilar occipitals were measured, indicating an age of 30-36 weeks in utero for both individuals. Although we suspect they were twins, thus far no data support or refute that hypothesis. The urn was decorated with Nasca-influenced motifs, and the fetuses/neonates were wrapped in plain, cotton textiles and cotton ropes. Fetus urn burials have also been recovered at Conchopata, a Wari heartland site, and comparisons show some key distinctions. For example, the La Real urn contained a double burial, the fetal/neonate remains were wrapped in textiles, and no other artifacts were found in the urn. These distinctions reflect the importance of local mortuary practices in the face of Wari imperial influence in the region.

However, in populations with intentional artificial cranial modifications, the only option is scoring non-metric cranial traits since the craniometrics are too heavily affected by the modifications. Studies have shown that although non-metrics are the best alternative, some traits cause a bias that can differ based on the broad modification categories of annular and tabular. This study aims to add to these data by assessing the influence of the sub-categories of oblique and erect within the annular modification category and the degree of modification. The sample population consists of individuals from the Chanka cultural group located in the South-Central Andes of Peru during the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1000-1400). A total of 33 non-metric traits were scored on 102 individuals, 88 of which have modified crania.

In order to level the floors between the South Pavilion basement and the new, immediately adjacent wing, Thomas Jefferson’s enslaved laborers used three feet of sediment to raise the basement floor. Recent excavations removed nearly a third of this fill. Preliminary analysis presented at the 2017 SHA Conference sought to establish a chronology for these South Pavilion deposits. Results also indicated a strong resemblance in both sediment and artifact composition to strata excavated in the nearby Kitchen Yard by Dr. William Kelso during the 1980s and re-analyzed in 2008. Using statistical analyses, this poster expands upon those findings to check the validity of one origin source for both the Kitchen Yard and South Pavilion deposits.

These resources were key to the practice of homesteading; a type of small-scale subsistence living that was a mechanism not only for survival but of familial and communal pride that continues to this day. Boone Lake, formed from the damming of the Holston and Watauga Rivers, has covered many early occupation sites from this region. Surface survey along the lake periphery and riverbanks indicates historical occupations beginning as early as the late 1700s, continuing until the mid-1900s. Examining the distribution of artifacts from these disturbed sites by material type proportions and temporal spans will shed light on occupational patterns and social dynamics for this underinvestigated region. The composition of the glass and ceramic assemblages will investigate food preservation patterns, availability of consumable resources, and household economics. Self-reliance and sustainability are continued cultural traditions in this mountainous region and would have played a major role in the maintenance of an autonomous homesteading household.

The oldest identified sites on Yap are identified by presence calcareous sand tempered (CST) pottery from deeply stratified deposits. With few exceptions, CST pottery, made from locally produced clay, has been recovered from Rungluw and Pemrang, two sites in southern Yap, western Micronesia (northwest tropical Pacific). Although poor preservation conditions and small sample sizes make it difficult to reconstruct vessel size, detailed analysis of sherds demonstrates at least two sub-types.

Identifying the scale of agricultural productivity in arid environments between urban centers and their hinterlands can be examined using botanical remains overlaid with spatially variant environmental attributes that are deemed essential in the success of agrarian practices.

","Neolithic","Digital Archaeology","Environment and Climate ","During the early and middle Holocene, the introduction of agropastoral subsistence to Europe resulted in significant social and economic transformations. For decades, researchers have recognized that early agricultural communities had an ecological impact on the surrounding landscapes. As a whole, paleoecological records indicate increases in charcoal abundance and changes in vegetation communities’ distribution or diversity related to Neolithic agricultural land clearing, burning, or pastoral activities. Yet, most research on the paleoenvironmental impact of Neolithic agropastoral systems have been limited to site-based or regional analyses—without a broader discussion of the ecological impact of Neolithic land-use across multiple ecoregions. 
 This study attempts to better understand the spread of Neolithic subsistence across Europe by contrasting the chronological and spatial patterning of the spread of agriculture with the palynology of Europe during this period. We utilize a database of over 5,000 radiocarbon dates from Neolithic contexts through Europe and a comprehensive pollen dataset adapted from the European Pollen Database. From these data, we construct and statistically compare chronosurfaces of Neolithic occupation and major vegetation transformations to track the pace and intensity of ecological change in Europe due to the initial shift to agropastoral land-use.

Many were forced to labor in distant mines and work camps, decimating local communities. The south-central highlands of Peru were an especially rich area for mineral exploitation and mines, work camps, and processing mills have been identified throughout the Northern Lake Titicaca Basin. Despite being a major center for colonial mining, no archaeological research to date has been conducted in the region. This poster presents preliminary mapping and surface survey data from multiple colonial silver processing sites (often called ingenios or trapiches) located 10 km southwest of Puno. These sites exhibit a variety of indigenous and Spanish architectural forms and spatial patterns. Spatial analysis techniques are applied to compare the spatial layout of domestic buildings, work zones, and communal areas at each site, noting differential levels of accessibility and visibility. Analysis reveals how social inequality, restricted and controlled access, and difficult living conditions were part of everyday social life for indigenous miners and laborers at these sites.",26,"Sarah_Kennedy","Sa-morning"

Over the course of the Late and Terminal Preclassic periods (ca. 350BC-AD200), as Ceibal grew into an urban center, minor temples were built at regular intervals around the site core. These temples were the centers of local communities that were integrated primarily through ritual practices. Many temple groups are associated with reservoirs or other sources of water. As many scholars have noted, reservoirs would have been important locations for day-to-day interactions, and crucial to supporting local populations. In this way, water management was also central to local community formation and organization. This study examines water management at the community level by focusing on 1) excavation data and field observations of five reservoirs; 2) geospatial analyses that explore the distribution of reservoirs in relation to residential zoning patterns around minor temples; and 3) analysis of pollen in soils collected from the reservoirs. Overall, this research suggests that water catchments were managed at the household and local community level, and supports decentralized models of social and political organization in ancient Maya society.",25,"Melissa_Burham","Sa-morning"

","Intermediate Area","Digital Archaeology: GIS","Resilience and Sustainability","The Tilarán -Arenal region of Costa Rica is one of the most volcanically active regions in the world. Despite the inherent hazard, people have occupied this region since the Paleo-Indian period (7000 B.C.). Numerous studies have explored volcanic eruptions as forcing mechanism that lead to culture; however, starting with the advent of sedentary villages during the Tronodora phase (2000-500 B.C.) until the arrival of Spanish in the 16th century, people maintained relatively small-scale, semi-horticultural societies. To explore the adaptability of the pre-historic peoples of this region, this research aims to address innovative ways people respond, recover, and mitigate disaster by dynamically modeling risk using GIS. This is important for the Tilarán -Arenal region as this is an area with variable topographic terrain and microclimates. The repeated volcanic eruptions were not uniform events with clearly demarcated boundaries but rather would have had diverse impacts even within relatively small geographic areas. In applying this methodology to the Tilarán-Arenal region, this research aims to expand beyond the pervasive holistic effects scenario that pervades disaster research.

In Kansas, the Unmarked Burial Sites Preservation Act exists to protect these sites, but this law is only effective if the location of these features is known. Most prehistoric mounds in this region are subtle in appearance, making them difficult to recognize. If sites are not recorded and protected, they may be unintentionally or intentionally destroyed. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software and the Kanas State Historical Society Archaeological Site Inventory, a map was created pinpointing the locations of recorded burial mounds in Clay, Geary, Pottawatomie, Riley, and Wabaunsee counties. Geographic associations of known mounds relative to topographic and hydrologic features were highlighted in order to recognize spatial patterns and simple statistical procedures were used to predict areas with high potential for past use as prehistoric burial sites. Samples of these areas were targeted for pedestrian survey to identify and record additional burial mound features with the overall goal of helping protect prehistoric burial sites in northeastern Kansas. Four burial mound sites were recorded because of these surveys.

Recent theoretical and empirical research on the island suggests that ahu and moai were focal points for competitive and cooperative signaling by relatively small-scale communities dispersed across on the island. Evaluation of this hypothesis, however, requires the measurement of the amount of energy invested in the construction of these monuments and comparing these values to the relative quality of resources supporting local communities. Despite the significant amount of research directed towards Rapa Nui’s monuments, we currently lack accurate, precise, and comprehensive estimates of monument size. To fill this gap, we used UAV-based photography and structure-from-motion photogrammetric tools to create scaled high-resolution, 3D representations of ahu. With these 3D models, we calculate volume estimates and use these values to derive energy investment estimates for each ahu. Using these data, we explore spatial patterns in energetic investment within and between local communities.",23,"Robert J._DiNapoli","Sa-morning"

In the southern Maya lowlands, an orientation of 14° clockwise from the cardinal directions is particularly common. How did the ancient Maya find this orientation? What was their surveying technique? Lidar from many sites shows that this orientation was not limited to major constructions. The smallest residential structures and patio groups, structures spread throughout the site, also were orientated to specific directions. The method of orientation had to be relatively simple, accessible to all levels of society, workable on all parts of the landscape (not just where the horizon is visible), and, most likely, usable at any time of year (e.g., not just at solstice or equinox). A first step in orientating a construction to a particular direction would be to establish the cardinal directions (separately, constructions also could be orientated to features on the horizon). Two methods to determine the cardinal directions are presented here: the north method and the Gnomon E-W method.

","Other","Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology","Trade and Exchange","Caravans form an important component of ancient trade routes world-wide. They were lifelines to settlements and connected diverse landscapes. They also encouraged complex transport networks. Our understanding of ancient ways of life along these trade routes is, however, hampered by an incomplete picture of the participants or caravaners themselves. This study uses quantitative and qualitative data from ethnoarchaeological and archaeological research on the Afar salt caravan route in northern Ethiopia to recreate human and animal foodways on the route. The Afar trade route transverses the North Ethiopian highlands during the Aksumite period (400 BCE-900 CE) and the Afar desert. Today pack-based caravans transport c. 70,000 tons of salt annually. Archaeological data indicate that people at caravan campsites consumed more plant than animal based diets. Sheep, goats, and cattle were used to supplement caravan diets but were only found at logistical support settlement sites such as border towns. Caravan campsites were dominated by plant remains such as wheat and barley, grains used for making bread. The chaff of these plants, on the other hand, was used as animal feed. Fired bread making stones were also found at the site of Ona Adi Agway in Agula.",22,"Helina_Woldekiros","Sa-morning"

We quantified obsidian and chert artifacts based on form and material in order to examine the nature of the lithic economy during this time. The findings suggest that the inhabitants of Los Mogotes were not primary producers of obsidian tools but were dependent on long-distance exchange for already manufactured goods. Despite being closer to high quality obsidian sources in Pachuca, Hidalgo, Los Mogotes relied on grey obsidian from sources located farther away (such as Ucareo, Michoacan). The lack of evidence of primary obsidian production suggests a down-the-line model of exchange of obsidian tools, many of which were later reworked into secondary or tertiary items. This pattern contrasts with evidence of primary production using more locally available chert. These findings conform to broader regional trends observed at contemporaneous sites during this time. Our interpretations focus on how the broader political economy shaped access to resources and the institutions necessary for their distribution.

With the intensification of these trade relations, craftsmen began expanding their repertoire of iron and copper metal production to include tin and bronze materials. Thus, were these new materials imported? Is this a case of technology transfer? Or perhaps an independent invention of bronze in southern Africa? We present data from chemical and lead isotopic analyses on copper and bronze objects from Bosutswe, Great Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe, Rooiberg, Thulamela, and Verwoert, as well as a lead isotopic database of sulfide ores from the region of southern Africa. Initial ore results indicate a heterogeneous array of lead isotope data, including the major prehistoric mines of Phalaborwa, Rooiberg, Copper Queen, Tsumeb, Kimberly, and Messina.

In contrast to the preceding periods, in which mixed agro-pastoral groups appear to have dominated highland Peru, many LIP populations seem to have adopted increasingly specialized pastoral or agricultural strategies. This increased economic specialization would likely have fostered inter-group cooperation, as subsistence generally required the products of both herding and agriculture. In tandem with this, the LIP also saw the development of new forms and scales of ritual, as groups sought to extend their geographic reach and influence. 

Drawing on excavation data and analysis of micromorphological samples from Sangayaico, in the Upper Ica drainage of the south-central Peruvian Andes, we examine how one LIP community established and maintained bonds of cooperation in a time of major political and economic transitions. Initial excavation data – such as the plaza dated to the LIP – suggests that ritual activity at Sangayaico increased in scale and intensity during this period. Micromorphological analysis of these ritual contexts has helped to illuminate how these features were constructed and used, thus furthering our understanding of how communities used ritual to mediate community relations.

This field system was presumably in production at the time Las Peñas was occupied and is still in use today. Using coring techniques, sediment samples, GPR data, and aerial photography, I examined the hydrologic and geologic dynamics of the landscape to understand their potential relationship to the people who occupied Las Peñas. These data were analyzed in combination with sediment samples from the site of Cerro X, an unexcavated potential Middle Horizon reservoir, to put the Las Peñas spring in the broader context of the Moquegua Valley. Small spring systems can teach archaeologists about water storage in arid, highland conditions. It can also provide unique insight on the ancient and modern hydrology of sloped agricultural terraces.

A shift to smaller individuals without a change in oyster growth rate was documented from the Late Archaic into the Caloosahatchee when Calusa population size increased considerably in the region.

New data from recent excavations from Mound Key, Estero Bay, further support these interpretations. 35 samples spanning ~ AD 1000–AD 1400 all exhibit similar small sizes consistent with the Late Caloosahatchee period across the broader region. Additionally, taphonomic grading (sensu Savarese et al., 2016) also demonstrates that Mound Key’s midden oysters were harvested for consumption, rather than mined strictly as building material.

This project seeks to provide experimental evidence of fracture variation attributed to differences in weapon morphology, which can be compared to the blunt force trauma identified on recovered skulls. The study focuses on two distinct weapons frequently observed in the Chankan archaeological record: the star mace and the circular mace.  The weapons were reconstructed in accurate weight and form from casts of authentic artifacts and will strike 10mm-thick casts of dental plaster, which mimic the frontal bone—a probable surface for impact damage in hand-to-hand combat. To achieve an accurate result, the experiment will consist of no less than 100 trials. Preliminary assessment suggests the star mace will result in the most fractures due to its several points, rolling across the frontal bone to create multiple areas of impact damage; however, the greater weight of the circular mace is expected to result in wounds of greater depth.

Forensic archaeologists’ extensive knowledge of postmortem taphonomic effects on material objects has led to more precise interpretations of postmortem interval, environmental (including scavenger-induced) scattering and alteration of human remains, and site formation processes. Experimental taphonomic research has formed the core of these advances in site interpretation, particularly through its focus on differentiating perimortem (at or around the time of death) from postmortem events. This concept is illustrated through RU Forensic Science Institute (RUFSI) research aimed at differentiating perimortem bone fracture from postmortem breakage. A sample of 300 Sus scrofa ribs underwent controlled Blunt Force Trauma in the RUFSI at known periodic perimortem and postmortem intervals, ranging from 0 to 112 days of environmental exposure. Resulting rib fractures were analyzed macroscopically and microscopically to define signature fracture morphology across time periods. These results allow differentiation of perimortem fracture versus postmortem breakage and inform period of exposure and contextual history of field remains. Forensic archaeology research can therefore play an integral role in interpretations of traditional archaeological method and theory.

Owing to specific design attributes, thin slate fishing knives were critical to the necessarily efficient and rapid processing of tens of thousands of salmon in a span of only three or four months. Although anthropologists have a reasonably good understanding of how slate knives were used, there is a paucity of ethnographic and historical data addressing how these critical tools were made. This poster highlights experimental archaeological research addressing the stages, techniques, and organization of slate knife production with an eye toward understanding variability in the byproducts of knife-making activities. A key feature of our project is a companion study of the tool-making process using large-scale, digital, multimedia data gathering and analysis techniques. Digital video and digital photography are used to capture important information on how toolmakers change their bodily orientation to stage-specific crafting work, the tool-making implements they use, and the social interactions and discourses that mediate the work. We argue that these data are crucial to an understanding of the embodied, tactile, and otherwise sensorial experiences of tool production.

","Other","Experimental Archaeology","Other","Interpretation of stone tool function may be compromised when flakes display edge damage that cannot be attributed to a specific task, or distinguished from non-anthropogenic damage introduced during an artifact’s taphonomic history. Many previous studies of edge damage have focused on microscopic damage patterns and examined a limited subset of tools, which may not accurately represent the whole assemblage. This research uses new methods in macroscopic edge damage analysis that allow larger samples of flakes to be measured, and has shown promise in distinguishing flakes used in experimental butchery from flakes that have been experimentally trampled by small ungulates. Here we look at flakes from two experimental assemblages to determine the relationships between duration of use, edge damage, and cut mark patterning. Results indicates that this approach distinguishes use damage and post-depositional damage, and that the extent of macroscopic damage does not increase with longer usage time. There is no significant relationship between duration of use, total amount of edge damage and cut mark count. This may indicate that lithics with a high degree of damage, which were thought to be habitually used, may have had a shorter use life than previously thought.",20,"Misganaw_Woldestadik","Sa-morning"

Menorca is a UNESCO biosphere reserve and candidate for World Heritage status. Menorca preserves archaeological and cultural sites from every period of its history, ranging from megalithic Bronze/Iron Age settlements to the remains of the Spanish Civil War. The island’s rich cultural legacy, together with its impressive and diverse natural settings, makes it an outstanding laboratory for studying heritage management.

During the field school we introduced students to the principles and practice of archaeological stewardship: preservation, interpretation, management, and public outreach. There is nothing more eye-opening than learning this in situ: at sites, museums, and throughout the landscape. A student project researched links between the US and Menorca. From Admiral Farragut to the Second World War, students discovered a fascinating common past worth safeguarding for the future.

Horizontal excavation is the only way to confirm the nature of features detected by magnetic gradiometry, but in some cases may be impossible or undesirable. Excavation-based understandings of local architectural practices can be used to infer the nature of magnetic anomalies, as long as those understandings encompass the full range of architectural variability that may reasonably be expected. Magnetic gradiometry was conducted at three sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Iroquoian villages in Ontario, Canada: Spang, Trent-Foster, and Hamilton-Lougheed. A search of extant excavation records was conducted to characterize the range of architectural variability likely to be found on these sites, including structure dimensions, hearth placement, and wall construction techniques. The different kinds of anomalies that these structural variations might present in magnetic gradiometry data were reproduced, and compared to actual data collected from the three sites. Based on these expectations and the identified anomalies, significant intersite and intrasite architectural variability is inferred.

This poster presents results from a macroregional investigation of late prehistoric and early colonial architectural remains (AD 1000-1700) in the circum-Titicaca Basin of southern Peru. The authors pre-programmed fully autonomous drone flight paths as a novel approach to archaeological site mapping in order to reduce the amount of time tending to drone flight. Ultimately, while autonomous flight was not without challenges, initial testing of this methodology alongside more traditional manual flying methods at several sites across the Titicaca Basin demonstrates how pre-programming flights can alleviate many in-field technical distractions and cut down on the time necessary to capture systematic and site-wide coverage, thus allowing archaeologists to turn their attention to more important observations.",17,"Ryan_Smith","Sa-morning"

Here, however, I move away from the traditional chronological approach, in order to examine the iconographic data present in the form of representation itself, the so-called palimpsest. The way that meaning develops though the act of layering itself is a process by which the icons interact and modify one another.

Larger-bodied Lethrinidae, which are common in both periods, show a decline in relative abundance, while smaller-bodied Acanthuridae show a corresponding increase in abundance. Although this pattern might be viewed as evidence for resource depression, potentially linked to intensive fishing of Lethrinidae, bone measurements show no decrease in the size of Lethrinidae over time. A number of factors can account for the change in taxonomic abundance.

In this context, we present new remains of domestic dogs from five archaeological sites along the Paraná and Uruguay Rivers in the Northeast of Argentina, an area with few published records. We also discuss their roles within human societies. The studied sample includes seven cranial and one postcranial specimens corresponding to seven individuals, that comprise adults (n= 6) and youngs (n= 2). Estimated body size indicates that they belong to medium sized dogs (13-23 kg). Some they present anthropic cut marks (n= 4) and carnivore marks (n= 2). Two specimens were dated, one in 1119 ± 23 14C years B.P., and the other in 1910 ± 29 14C years B.P. It is concluded that in the Argentine Northeast Canis familiaris presents greater age variability and slightly larger sizes than previous records. The 14C dates extend the chronological range known for the region. Its presence is linked to hunter-gatherer-fisher and small scales horticulturalist populations with a marked fluvial adaptation.

This study focuses on biological kinship as it relates to burial location in an Eastern Zhou Period (771-256 BCE) cemetery. This study utilizes a sample of 45 individuals from the site of Tiancheng in Xinzheng, Henan Province, China. Cervical odontometric data were collected, and measures of biological distance were calculated to examine the relationship between geographical and biological distances among the individuals interred across the site to address the question of whether burial location was influenced by biological relationships.

Kalmikkilgan in modern day Uzbekistan. According to historical sources, the medieval period in
Central Asia was a time of reshaping ethnic, religious, and political identities: Islam spread
widely across the region, waves of Turkic peoples migrated into the region, and a series of large
territorial states rose to power. This period has been understudied from an archaeological
perspective, leaving gaps in our understanding of how groups and individuals expressed identity
in these shifting social landscapes. One practice that bioarchaeologists have focused
on in the examination of identity is cranial modification, due to its highly visible nature. Cranial
modification has been identified in several individuals from the Kalmikkilgan site in the
Khoresm region. To document the types and degrees of modification present, we digitized
three-dimensional cranial landmark data and analyzed shape difference between individuals
using finite element scaling analysis. Our results indicate that at least two types of cranial
modification are present, with one individual lacking evidence of modification.

We test these apparent correlations through a multifaceted study of nearly a dozen burial mound assemblages from across northern peninsular Florida, seeking to infer patterns of human mobility, social interaction and community formation in the context of mortuary rituals. Isotopic analysis of skeletal populations are combined with demographic and life history information from individual secondary interments to model patterns of diet and mobility. Neutron Activation Analysis of pottery, compared with data from clays across the region, is used to source ornate mortuary wares. Results indicate that frequent transport of mortuary pots and possible integration of disparate populations were fundamental to religious expansion and social change.

The Terminal Formative included the emergence of an urban center at the site of Río Viejo, which may have extended political influence over surrounding communities. During this period, on the coast of Oaxaca, ceramic figurines were a ubiquitous medium for expression and identity in political/cultural exchanges. By comparing ceramic figurines from the site of Rio Viejo, a primary center, to Cerro de la Virgen, a secondary community, relations between these two communities can be better understood. Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses, including INAA, much can be postulated about the manufacture and use of the ceramic figurines. The figurines from both sites have proven to be diverse in their iconography as well as sharing many other aesthetic similarities. With Terminal Formative figurines here some iconographic trends that seem to exist as categories such as anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, which are expressed by a number of well-preserved artifacts. The ceramic figurines have also proven to be diverse in their use: some are musical instruments, some are able to stand, and others were able to be worn.

Our isotopic data show a consistent relationship to each recipe’s ingredients.

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.  This study hopes to test each these dynamics through the nondestructive analysis of ceramics excavated from Machu Llacta using a Bruker Tracer Vi handheld pXRF unit.

Current evidence suggests that residents of the early capital of Izapa, located on a piedmont environmental zone of the southern Pacific coast, fared better than neighbors in other early cities during this transition. From their piedmont location, residents of Izapa would have had access to plant resources from a wide variety of environmental zones, including the coastal plain, estuaries, mangrove swamps, and the beach. This study applies starch grain analysis, a microbotanical technique, to ceramics and ground stone pieces recovered from domestic ritual and refuse deposits at the Formative period capital of Izapa. Documentation of the diversity of plant foods used by Izapa’s population is intended to better understand the resilience of this coastal population during a period of potential environmental stress, when maize agriculture may have been a less reliable source of food.",2,"Rebecca_Mendelsohn","Fr-morning"

The presence/absence of cortex is often linked to reduction intensity with variable cortical frequencies linked to early or late stage reduction and potentially reflective of residential mobility. However, we lack reliable markers or values to support our interpretations. Recently, Harold Dibble (and others) have proposed a method for evaluating assemblage cortex by comparing observed and expected frequencies. These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility. This paper applies the method developed by Dibble and others to the lithic assemblage from the Beaucoup site (24PH188/189) in northern Montana, a Late Prehistoric site with spatially distinct kill, processing, and residential areas. The lithic raw materials found in the assemblage (particularly quartzites) occur on-site and, as a result raw material size, shape, and origins are known.

","Neolithic","Ceramic Analysis","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers","Archaeologists suggest that during the transitions between the Pleistocene and the Holocene, drastic changes occurred in the lifeways of humanity. They are termed the “Neolithization processes.” Changes include the advent of food production and sedentism, and the adoption of pottery and ground stones. However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes. Our results add new understanding to our previous results on the timings of technological, behavioral, and paleoenvironmental changes.

","Contact Period","Survey","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers","Much of the archaeological research done in the interior deserts of Australia has focused on rockshelter sites, primarily because of intact stratigraphy and better preservation than in open air contexts. However, ethnographic studies of local Martu populations have demonstrated that people rarely lived in rockshelters or caves, particularly during the wet season when populations focused around reliable soaks and clay pans. Therefore, it is necessary to study the distribution of archaeological sites and cultural materials in open air contexts to fully understand settlement patterns. During the 2017 field season, we conducted a systematic survey of the Wuukurta Clay Pan region in Karlamilyi National Park, less than a day’s walk west of the present-day Parnngurr aboriginal community. The cultural landscape surrounding the main soak contains extensive groundstone and lithics, with the highest densities of cultural materials at the edge of the soak and two clay pans. Seasonally available water and subsistence resources attracted people to the region and provided the potential to support wet season population aggregation. This poster shows the distribution of cultural materials in Wuukurta and demonstrates the archaeological research potential of open air contexts in understudied desert environments.",1,"Christopher_Jazwa","Fr-morning"
