unlike most material culture, rock art is firmly embedded in its place. this particular circumstance has shaped its research, as well as its reception among the general public. while famous sites, such as lascaux, are well known and recognised despite difficulty in accessing them, other sites, especially those in canada, are still relatively unknown. this paper will briefly address how rock art has been consumed and presented to the general public within canada. next, i will address how this heritage can be brought to millions through the medium of a virtual exhibit. i will then discuss the project of a virtual exhibit that has been undertaken by the musée de la civilisation and université du québec à montréal and i will focus on the advantages and challenges that new technologies can create in how rock art is presented, preserved and ultimately understood.
