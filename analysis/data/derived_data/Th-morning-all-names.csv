Paleo-Inuit use of stone tools was a varied and highly skilled discipline involving intimate knowledge of the land, the properties of stone, and the appropriate ways of crafting tools.

The number of houses varies across the beach ridges suggesting populations fluctuated throughout the site’s use. However, new radiocarbon analyses indicate that all houses between 22-16.5 m asl are of the same general age, and that paleodemography at Alarniq is less straightforward than suggested by the number of features per beach ridge.

The 16th through 19th centuries witnessed increasing cross-cultural interactions between the Inuit of the Labrador coast and Europeans explorers, traders, and missionaries. The effects of colonialism in this period have been studied with respect to Inuit identity, material culture, gender, and social organization, but the nature of Inuit-animal relationships has received comparatively less attention. In addition to occupying a prominent social role, the sled dog facilitated Inuit mobility and hunting practices, but required considerable care and provisioning. In this paper, we employ carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of bulk bone collagen and amino acids to examine sled dog feeding practices between the 16th and 19th centuries. We analyze the remains of 60 archaeological dogs from six Inuit winter house sites from Labrador’s north and central coasts. While all of the dogs included in this study consumed predominantly marine-based protein, we note a degree of inter- and intrasite variation in both the carbon and nitrogen isotope values of the dogs. This variation is further explored with reference to the settlement history of Labrador, and to other stable isotope datasets from the Eastern Arctic to better understand the changing role of the dog in Inuit society.

Archaeofaunal assemblages often yield a wealth of complete bones, however, species-level identification is not possible for heavily fragmented specimens. Therefore, specific details about marine mammal utilization are often unquantified and marine species identification largely remains unverified. This paper reveals utility of ZooMS (zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry) and genetic analysis of ancient mtDNA to examine Norse uses of whales at an array of sites in Iceland and Greenland over the course of the Middle Ages (~800-1500 CE). The analysis of mtDNA and collagen collected from these sites yields new information on the importance of cetaceans and pinnipeds during this period. Comparison of samples and their suitability for mtDNA analysis also underscores the loss and degradation of genetic material in rapidly degrading Arctic contexts. With this loss, it is challenging to detect changes in marine mammal utilization and species composition through periods of climate change. Additionally, these data provide critical insight into premodern economies, and a snapshot of mammal community ecology and levels of genetic diversity prior to the advent of industrial-scale exploitation beginning in the 16th century.",Symposium,NA,Brenna_Frasier,2.25,8,2.25,Th-morning

Ethnographic and ethnohistoric literature indicates that pipe-smoking was part of rituals that cemented inter-tribal trade relationships. The data from this project support the idea that pipes were used in trade negotiations and ceremonial interactions and can be proxies for examining social interaction and regional mediation aspects of trade and decision making. The blending of Plains and Pueblo pipe forms and materials suggests that there may have been a certain level of integration, alliance, or partnership in these interactions.
Three categories of data totaling 1,306 pipes were analyzed from known trade centers and comparative samples from interior sites not known to be trade centers in the Southwest and Great Plains.

While paleodemographic, bioarchaeological, linguistic, and DNA evidence support a thirteenth century Mesa Verde-Northern Rio Grande migration, the lack of clear material culture evidence of this migration is perplexing. Critical to this discussion is the possibility of an earlier, tenth century migration of (presumably) Proto-Tiwa speakers from the Upper San Juan region into the Northern Rio Grande. While scholars generally agree that Proto-Tiwa split from Proto-Tewa no later than AD 1000, the location of this split, and the subsequent movement of Tiwa speakers, remain unresolved. In this presentation, I evaluate the ability of two competing hypotheses to account for the paleodemographic, linguistic, and archaeological evidence underpinning this question. The first hypothesis posits that Proto-Tiwa split from Proto-Tewa in the Upper San Juan region, which would support the idea of a Mesa Verde migration.

The Jenny Clay study area is located in a broad alluvial valley surrounded by the Vermillion Cliffs, and contains several key resources that likely contributed to significant prehistoric settlement. Deep alluvium overlaid with thin to substantial aeolian sediments provided a range of opportunities for dry-farming agriculturalists; naturally occurring and often high quality petrified wood is readily available throughout the study area; water is available from perennial springs; and the study area is part of a deer migration corridor.

Research in the middle Rio Grande valley of New Mexico documents a 4,000-year long record from 3000 BC to AD 900. Archaic period structures, dated 3000 BC to about AD 250, display little change in form, size, and construction details.

Long-term architectural and technological stability gave way to rapid change coinciding with the appearance of agricultural domesticates after AD 500. Multi-dwelling  sites and architectural investments indicate decreased residential mobility. Simultaneously, distinctions in functionally specific domestic spaces appear with the separation of cooking areas from sleeping spaces. Sweeping changes occur in subsistence technology: groundstone reflects the shift from a seed-based diet to a corn-based diet. Cooking features changed from rock-lined pits to formalized hearths. Domesticated corn required ceramics for cooking; size, shape, and location of storage features also changed rapidly. Implications for cultural continuity and in-place population growth are discussed in light of these long-term trends.

Although the site has yielded important evidence of early Hohokam settlement and cultural developments, the sporadic nature of investigations, the lack of data from early fieldwork, and the destruction of significant portions of the site by the original Shamrock Dairy operation provide substantial challenges to understanding the occupational history and structure of this important prehistoric locality. Since 1999, archaeologists with Tierra Right of Way have investigated much of the locality and revealed extensive loci dating from the Tortolita through early Hohokam (Snaketown and Cañada del Oro) phases. This paper synthesizes previous and on-going research at the site to address the emergence of a local Hohokam tradition in this unique locality.

However, recent evidence for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis raises the possibility of a Pleistocene era dispersal. Poor bone preservation and small populations make finding Pleistocene-era bioarchaeological evidence of the disease difficult. Coupled with this, epidemiological studies suggest that population numbers were too low for an epidemic to take hold. Reconciling the epidemiological theory with the limited bioarchaeological evidence for the disease requires a closer examination of how behavior would influence transmission. I examine this possibility and report on several agent-based models I created in R to ascertain how tuberculosis may have arisen and dispersed. I incorporate archaeological, ethnographic, and biological data in order to understand how different human cultural behaviors, such as communal hunting, and other factors may have affected the spread of tuberculosis among hunters, gatherers, and foragers.

This paper details the results of archaeological survey in the Wind River Range, Wyoming between elevations of 9,000 and 11,000 ft. The purpose of this survey was to test a predictive model of a specific site type (sites referred to as villages) created by Stirn (2014) and tested by Stirn in a different region of the same mountain range. Although the methods of creating the predictive model were not altered, the survey methods were significantly altered. Random survey blocks were created within the project area to better sample the landscape for archaeological sites. The use of GPS track logs allowed for quantification of survey intensity and highlighted areas that were not intensely surveyed. The distribution of sites and the quantified surveyed area were compared in order to rule out survey bias as a factor influencing the discovered distribution of sites. The model was not successful in discovering alpine village sites and the distribution of the newly discovered sites can be explained by survey bias. Comparison of lithic assemblages including tools and debitage indicate that the newly discovered sites and previously discovered village locations have differences in tool diversity and debitage:tool ratios, but contain similar attributes of debitage assemblages.

This paper sets out results obtained following a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis of the spatial patterning of stone tools at a study area in the Colorado Desert of southern California. Stone tools are examined based on their utility for an explanation of their use and importance in the lives of prehistoric foragers. Current efforts to understand the prehistory of the region is undertaken, mostly, by environmental consultants in the private sector of archaeology as part of a formal [legal] obligation prior to large land development in the form of green energy projects. The results of such analyses seldom make it to the public as published material. This study employs an academic lens to extrapolate qualitative information from quantitative data from previously unpublished cultural resources management (CRM) investigations in the region. The application of optimal foraging theory, to this study, allows for the examination of human and environmental factors and constraints facilitating predictions and interpretations of prehistoric forager behaviors and their occurrence and frequency in the archaeological record at the study area.

Environmental constraints of the desert can explain people’s decisions to consider energy-efficient modes of travel through the framework of Human Behavioral Ecology. Culture, however, does not always follow the model of Human Behavioral Ecology, even in environments posing challenges that require efficient ways of living. Cultural knowledge, beliefs, and values are shared through generations, transforming an environment from constraining to familiar. By exploring the relationship between environmental constraints and route selections of ancient humans, we can support Human Behavioral Ecology as a baseline explanation for ancient trails in the desert. Although people do not always follow the most energy efficient routes, shifting their focus from efficiency to a different value. Perhaps we can further understand how people selected routes within a certain environment by measuring and comparing the most energy efficient routes on a cultural landscape to actual trails on the same cultural landscape.

 To answer this question, baskets of selected northeastern California Native American groups, will be statistically compared to test whether ethnic origin is indicated in the results, and whether linguistic affiliation or geographic propinquity best account for differences and similarities between basket weavers.

The study focuses on ritual phenomena exhibited at two Late Mississippian Period (ca. late 1200s A.D. to A.D. 1500) settlements in southern Illinois, the Millstone Bluff site in Pope County (11Pp3) and the Dillow’s Ridge site in Union County (11U635). Millstone Bluff has been interpreted as a site of public ritual and unusual symbolic importance evidenced by its general location and topography, spatial organization, and distinctive rock art. Though Dillow’s Ridge was the locale for an inordinate level of chert tool production, in other ways the site is understood to be typical of Mississippian villages for this region and time. The sites serve, respectively, as proxies for high and low levels of public ritual phenomena.

One such feature, a large, silo-shaped pit yielded a proportionately large number of skeletal elements identified to several species of waterbirds, a trait unique among contemporaneous sites reported within the area. The archaeological record of pre-Columbian cultures of the North American Southeast demonstrates the ritual importance of birds in the form of effigy pipes, copper and mica cutouts, and mortuary vessels that extend well into and beyond the first millennium A.D. Given the spatial and temporal relationship of Shell Mound with a large mortuary facility (Palmetto Mound), and the relationship of the faunal contents with recurring iconographic characters of this time period, the avian assemblage from Feature 25 should be expected to represent practices outside of everyday subsistence. Based upon the presence of juvenile white ibis elements, which offer a proxy for the timing of capture for this apparently ritually charged class of animal, this paper proposes the presence of waterbird elements recovered in this context represents ritualized deposition coinciding with events surrounding the summer solstice.",Symposium,NA,Joshua_Goodwin,3.75,14,3.75,Th-morning

This paper will discuss the local organization of residential communities in the context of the Safety Harbor culture, which occurred on the west central Gulf coast of Florida in late pre-Columbian times. Early Safety Harbor culture represents a transition from Woodland period communalism to the hierarchical systems witnessed in the early historic period, though the timing and nature of these changes remains ambiguous. The limited amount of evidence from domestic contexts has made it difficult to understand the degree to which changes in regional settlement corresponded with new ways of managing local relationships. I will focus in particular on recent work at the Weeden Island site (8Pi1), including evidence for an emphasis on crafting special-purpose shell ornaments and the integration of crafting activities with other aspects of subsistence.

This paper addresses these historical processes during the terminal occupation of Moundville, a multiple mound Mississippian civic-ceremonial complex occupied from A.D. 1200-1550 and located in west-central Alabama. The collapse of ancient complex societies has been proposed as a process of rapid disintegration of established practices and the loss of vital resources or sociopolitical institutions that maintained social complexity. Sudden shifts in materiality and monumentality during the fifteenth century at Moundville have been proposed as evidence for the collapse of the political order. This paper reevaluates the timing of these changes through Bayesian modeling of radiocarbon dates from stratigraphic mound midden deposits and revisits changes the production and consumption of symbolic art and monumental architecture. This paper demonstrates that while some ritual practices at Moundville changed, others were emphasized, supporting a reorganization of the social and political order around highly visible symbols and ritual objects. This newly observed persistence of materiality and monumentality has implications for shifts in the social reproduction observed in other late prehistoric Southeastern societies.",Symposium,NA,Erik_Porth,3.75,14,3.75,Th-morning

Major canals, large midden-mounds, and fish-capture/storage facilities were constructed following a ninth-century hiatus during a challenging period of global cooling known as the Vandal Minimum. The succeeding Medieval Warm Period ameliorated the productivity of the shallow-water estuarine environments around Mound Key and Pineland, providing new opportunities. We think that certain leaders were able to mobilize surplus labor to construct canals, maintain and rebuild structures, procure resources from faraway mainland forests, and coordinate and oversee the engineering of “watercourt” structures that probably functioned as fish traps and/or fish storage areas.

During this time, Estero Bay’s estuarine ecology and coastal geomorphology developed in response to variable rates of sea-level rise (SLR) and climate change. Our work integrates archaeological and geological perspectives on this intertwined history of the Calusa and their environment. Specifically, we found correlations between shifts in estuarine salinity of the bay, as it closed, and the types of shellfish exploited by its inhabitants. As salinity lowered in the bay, favoring oyster reef productivity, the Calusa shifted away from more marine-based shellfish and to more heavily exploit oyster resources for surplus production. Concomitant with these shifts were changes in site organization and layout, which included construction and alteration of new landforms and features (e.g., canals and mounds). Estuarine conditions today are comparable to those in Calusa’s later history, but SLR acceleration threatens a shift back to the earlier estuarine ecology and geomorphology.

Drawing inspiration from the work of Ingold, I seek to find the middle ground of phenomenology, ecology, and materiality in describing how humans dwell and make their worlds among the various other communities around them. In the Lower Suwannee River Valley, Florida human and oyster communities have interacted and intersected with another for millennia. Like people, oysters dwell and build creating their Umwelt, a concept introduced by Von Uexküll. This resulted in communities numbering in the millions. When the Umwelten of oysters and people are juxtaposed, it is argued that oysters ‘anchored’ people differentially throughout the history of the region. These oyster communities are argued to represent Heideggarian Buildings, as they are locations which make sites for several coastal Umwelten, people included. Prior to 1500 BC, human communities relocated their dead to keep pace with the rising sea, emplacing oyster shell midden during the process. After an occupational hiatus, changes in human building and dwelling post 750 BC were a direct result of inhabiting an area already full of history, including past interactions with oyster beds. Florida Gulf Coast peoples in the Lower Suwannee in many ways defined themselves through relationships with the oyster communities they interacted with.

Although structure fires appear to be common to all Orendorf settlements, there is substantial variation in several characteristics of the burned house features. An analysis of these variations suggests that both controlled (intentional) and uncontrolled (either accidental or malicious) structure fires are represented among the settlements at Orendorf. “Controlled” and “uncontrolled” classes of burned structures are considered within the context of other archaeological, ethnohistoric, and ethnographic evidence for ceremonial burning, utilitarian burning, wildfires, and warfare.

One driver may be what is known in ecology as an Allee effect, a positive relationship between population density and per capita utility. Allee effects may emerge with economies of scale such as those created by some forms of intensified food acquisition and production. Thus, in an Allee-like setting, individuals belonging to larger groups enjoy the benefits of greater efficiency and productivity of subsistence, as well as group defense, mating opportunities, cooperative parenting, etc. Here we evaluate this hypothesis by examining the process of initial plant domestication in Eastern North America, where we expect the process of intensification should co-occur with a shift from more dispersed to more clustered settlement patterns as individuals begin to benefit from aggregation. Application of the Clark-Evans Nearest Neighbor Index to dated site locations available from the Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database support our predictions, revealing a shift from dispersed to clustered settlements that coincides with the initial domestication of plants in the region.

However, principles based on settlement scaling theory have yet to be tested in the Eastern Woodlands of the United States despite the existence of a robust sample of settlements, including those containing monumental architecture. As part of a broad regional study, I collected spatial data on settlement size, monuments, and public spaces at 70 sites located in the Eastern Woodlands occupied between 3500 BC and AD 1700. In general, sites exceeding 20 hectares exhibit distinct characteristics related to monumental architecture and public space when compared to smaller examples. A central question is whether these larger settlements possess fundamentally different scaling relations or if the former merely represent scaled-up versions of the latter. This paper explores the relationship between those attributes to determine quantitative patterns and qualitative differences between small and large settlement patterns.

",Paleolithic,Zooarchaeology,Subsistence and Foodways,"The creation of a robust method of species identification using collagen fingerprinting, also known as ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) has been useful for objectively defining the composition of the fragmentary component of archaeological assemblages. The method usually works through the measurements of the sizes of collagen peptides following enzymatic digestion, which yield a fingerprint that can be genus or even species-specific. However, even these peptide biomarkers have been determined with a level of subjectivity, largely influenced by those most peaks that are commonly observed. In some taxa, particularly the domesticates, sequence data can be used to confirm this variation but ZooMS is being increasingly applied to a greater range of wild taxa. In the absence of sequence information, peptide biomarkers are proposed through observations from reference material, but often with less confidence. Here we apply machine learning to our assemblage of >10,000 Pin Hole Cave (Creswell Crags, UK) fragmentary Late Pleistocene microfaunal remains, demonstrating that an objective manner of biomarker determination can be achieved which builds upon those already determined manually.

Commonly called “turtlers”, 25% of the population was involved in the capture and sale of sea turtles by the late eighteenth century. Offshore reconnaissance on St. George’s Caye has led to the recovery of sea turtle remains associated with turtle corrals that were documented on a 1764 map. Per results of faunal analysis from the island, the majority of animal remains recovered belong to at least two different species of sea turtle. Turtle species varied in their preference by people as a food item, the method of capture, and their role in the economy.

ZooMS harnesses the potential of preserved collagen, the most dominant and time-stable protein in bone, to generate peptide mass spectra that are diagnostic of faunal identity. Here, ZooMS is applied to 116 fish bone samples from a ~5000 year old assemblage from the Šventoji region of Lithuania to deduce species identity and construct assemblage compositions. Identifications from ZooMS analysis uncovered incorrect morphological identifications in 14% of the fish samples analysed. Furthermore, through the analysis of over twenty different species, we demonstrate the ability to distinguish between closely diverged members of the Salmo spp. (salmon) and Scophthalmus spp. (turbot) genera; some of the taxa most frequently misidentified in this assemblage.

This begs the question, just how likely (or unlikely) are artifacts to be accidentally associated with megafauna remains? Using a computer model, the likelihood of accidental cultural association with animal remains (in this case proboscidean) can be estimated. In the model proboscidean remains and archaeology sites were realistically distributed on a landscape using variables from predictive modeling and the modern proboscidean ecological record to understand the frequency of coincidental spatial associations.

The results of this research suggests that the MGUI does not seem appropriate for measuring the utility of animal portions by the Fremont. Reverse utility curves at several Fremont sites suggest that the Fremont were regularly bringing low utility elements back to residential sites at least part of the time. The MGUI can only consider caloric reasons for prehistoric hunters to return to habitation sites with low utility elements.

The rise of the Mississippian polity of Cahokia altered the religious, political, and social structures of long-established Midwestern cultural groups in contact with Cahokia, including the populations of the Oneota and Langford Tradition settled along the Mississippi River and its tributaries. While Mississippian period (AD 900–AD 1500) artifacts have been found in Langford Tradition contexts, there exist conflicting views on the range and depth of Cahokian influence on these populations. A study of faunal remains associated with the Langford Tradition Keeshin Farm site in Rockford, Illinois, and comparison of results from similar sites reveal changes in subsistence as a reaction to influence from both Cahokian and Oneota sources. Analysis of the Keeshin Farm faunal assemblage includes measuring dental wear patterns, determining seasonality for hunting, and identifying processing techniques for Cervus canadensis (wapiti), Odocoileus virginianus (whitetail deer), and other mammals commonly used for food. Keeshin Farm results are then compared to those at Hotel Plaza, Gentleman Farm, and Zimmerman sites in Illinois to provide further insight into continuity and change in Langford Tradition subsistence.

We have found that it is invaluable in the archaeological study of movement and transient labor.  In this paper, we aim to demonstrate how the use of geospatial technology in conjunction with the material record can offer a glimpse into the daily movements of transient laborers along Mid-Atlantic railway networks and industrial centers in the late 19th century through the Great Depression. Specifically, we suggest that the spatial relationships that emerge at an historic hobo jungle located just outside Delta, PA are not simply manifestations of economic or social hardship. Rather, we view transient worker movement and labor patterns as an essential aspect of early 20th century capitalism from which a unique form of resistance emerged. The distribution of artifacts within the site (revealing patterns of behavior by occupants coming and going from the camp over time), and the modeling of the physical location of the camp in proximity to the railroad, slate quarry, creek, and town center, are necessarily conjoined spatial and temporal units, which reveal a social structure dialectically entangled with the nearby town and broader regional economy.

The composition of elements in these landscapes shows how their designers manipulated geometric forms, architectural conventions, and standardized measurements to impose order in the garden. By the end of the 18th century fashionable American gardens tended towards irregular picturesque compositions, however the arrangement of individual garden elements to achieve that effect was rooted in the established traditions of geometric regularity. The interplay between these two styles can be seen explicitly at Poplar Forest, Thomas Jefferson’s retreat and plantation in Bedford County, Virginia. Not only does the overarching structure of the designed landscape exhibit this quality but archaeological evidence also shows how geometric forms structured individual garden elements. Archaeological remains of “tree clumps”, a staple of picturesque English landscapes, reveal Jefferson’s use of various geometric forms to create a naturalistic composition. This paper will contextualize this archaeological evidence through a synthesis of period gardening treatises in Jefferson’s possession and an examination of his other designed landscapes.

Excavations sponsored by the Maryland State Highways Administration have recovered datasets from two properties in New Market.

Faunal remains collected from each component were used to establish the relative economic and nutritional value within each assemblage. Access to meat at each component was then measured against the economic potential of the community as a whole, as documented in the historic record. Preliminary results show that decline in personal wealth, as measured by ability to purchase meat, lagged behind the decline of New Market as a commercial center. The lag may relate to improvements in trade and communications, which had allowed for the decentralization of the local economy, which in turn allowed individual actors to weather economic declines at specific nodes.

Whether Capital, Feudal, Social or other, no productive system has managed absent the abuse of its laboring class. Specifically, each mode of production required, in one form or another, a large body of unemployed or underemployed, peripatetic laborers. Currently, immigrant workers occupy this precarious position in the United States and elsewhere. Before the great depression Hobo’s crisscrossed the road and rail ways of the U.S., taking up temporary jobs before moving on to a new location. In Europe and parts of Asia, the Roma have a long history of this kind of movement and economic activity. Rarely do archaeologists consider these groups in our excavations and subsequent analysis and publications. Our work tends to glamorize the urban spaces which have attracted large populations across time. Yet, these peripatetic workers were every bit as essential to the development and maintenance of such spaces as those who dwelled and labored within them. This paper details the potential for an archaeology of transience and focuses on an excavation of a hobo camp outside of a small quarry town in South-central Pennsylvania.

Located next to the original campus grounds, San Pablo and Barrio del Hoyo were residential and commercial hubs of early Tempe. After World War II, urban development and renewal efforts by the university and land developers targeted these two neighborhoods for campus expansion and displaced their residents, quickly destroying the neighborhoods with the construction of apartments, dormitories, and other university buildings. Domestic features excavated in these two neighborhoods show us that, in the decades preceding their destruction, both neighborhoods were thriving, with residents of a variety of different incomes who pursued various economic pursuits—not unlike the Euro-American neighborhoods of early Tempe. San Pablo and Barrio del Hoyo were not blighted or in need of renewal and the eventual fates of these neighborhoods reflected their status as minority communities within Tempe, a lack of political power, and structural racism.

Excavations hoping to find compelling evidence of a powerful dynasty of rulers, such as a royal tomb, keep coming away empty-handed. However, the alternative possibility of a corporate or collective government, perhaps headed by a small number of co-rulers, also remains poorly understood. A third option is that the city’s collective government begun as a fully decentralized network of neighborhood representatives, but this kind of arrangement seems susceptible to the problems of cooperation and action coordination. Previously we used a computational model to show that in principle this latter worry is unfounded, as long as we assume that the network’s topology could be transformed via community rituals and was not strongly subdivided (Froese, Gershenson, and Manzanilla 2014). Here we extend this model to investigate whether centralized hierarchy could mitigate the negative effects of strong divisions. The new results reveal a peculiar synergy between hierarchy and community ritual in that only their combination improved the extent of coordination, which is consistent with portrayals of the elite as religious specialists serving the public.",Symposium,NA,Tom_Froese,3.75,14,3.75,Th-morning

Scholars have advanced a wide range of theories explaining the underlying motivations and purposes of these abundant and regulated ritual massacres. As an extension of recent efforts that examine ancient Aztec sacrifice as a multi-faceted and complex system, this paper utilizes a phenomenological approach to examine the “experience” of sacrificial rituals. Using modern bio-social-psychological theory, this paper reveals that the brutal treatment of captive enemy bodies in human sacrificial rituals provided physiological, psychological, and social rewards that turned these spectacular events into a form of enthralling entertainment. Several other recompenses for officiants and other spectator-participants included a sense of security, management of anxiety, and social bonding. In addition, this paper reveals that these ceremonies incorporated different shamanic elements that fostered communally experienced “altered states of consciousness” which further contributed to physiological rewards, the reduction of social anxieties, and an increase in social solidarity. The significance of this investigation is that it offers additional explanations for the massive scale and longevity of the practice of human sacrifice amongst the ancient Aztec.

Specifically, we investigate the degree to which political-economic factors affected production and access to projectile points, including the accessibility of non-local raw materials used in their production, and their distribution among various households. We test whether households with differing social statuses monopolized or controlled finished points, and if the raw materials used to produce them varied among households on the basis of status.

Izamal was the largest of these sites by far, and connected itself to other important sites with stone causeways that stretched up to 30 km long. Ucí, located approximately 35km to the northwest of Izamal, had its own long distance causeway which linked it to three smaller sites with monumental architecture. This paper combines data from two separate, long-running archaeology projects, one focused on Izamal, the other focused on Ucí, in order to investigate political, economic, and chronological relations between the two sites. The paper compares Late Preclassic, Protoclassic, and Classic period ceramic assemblages from the two projects in order to document the degree of variation in pottery consumption. Such variation may help determine the extent of economic and political integration between Uci and Izamal, but could also be accounted for by differential access to resources, participation in divergent trade connections, or differences in chronologies of occupation. This paper uses additional lines of evidence to assess the strength of these explanations.

Ceramicists working in the Maya lowlands have demonstrated the benefit of using petrographic analysis in conjunction with other methods including type/variety.  Few studies, however, have focused on the Preclassic period to address questions related to early economic organization through ceramic production and distribution.

The northern TRR had an occupation spanning from the Middle Preclassic through the Terminal Classic periods. Therefore, health through time, as well as between the sexes, presence or absence of cultural bodily modifications in relation to health, and socio-economic status were all examined within the northern Three Rivers Region study. Whereas elsewhere in the Maya region studies show dietary differences between males and females and indicate strong preferential treatment of males over females in regards to diet, the skeletal population of the northern Three Rivers Region does not exhibit such discrepancies.

",Maya: Classic,Ethnohistory/History,Social and Political Organization,"Several debates have endured for decades within the field of anthropological archaeology as to the character of lowland Classic period Maya political organization. Scholars have been struck by the contrast between Maya regal-ritual centers possessed of impressive monumental architecture with the minimal references from the documentary record to any kind of bureaucratic organization. There is disagreement as to the scale of the larger Maya polities and whether or not some polities had begun to move away from kinship as a central organizing principle. There are even more fundamental disagreements as to whether some or most Maya Classic period political systems could be termed states, and if so, the degree to which political power was centralized in the institution of kingship. 
    The political systems of early medieval Ireland resemble those of the Classic period Maya on many grounds. The scalar, organizational and demographic attributes of Maya and Irish political systems will be compared systematically in order to tease out the factors that may account for their similarities. Models pertaining to chiefdoms and states will be evaluated as to their suitability.

",Maya: Classic,Other,Household Archaeology,"This paper summarizes recent archaeological investigations at the San Lorenzo settlement cluster in the Mopan River Valley of Western Belize. Current research at this ancient hinterland settlement is concerned with better understanding household economic organization and integration during the Late and Terminal Classic (A.D. 670-890) occupations of this site. 
Households are fundamental units of economic organization in both past and present societies. The examination of ancient household remains enables archaeologists to better understand micro-scale economic activities, and to situate those activities within larger societal contexts. Investigations at San Lorenzo focus on the areas associated with four structure groups. In accord with previous research at this site, analyses of collected data from these groups show similarities in terms of basic domestic activities. Ongoing analysis of lithic macroartifacts indicates differences among households in terms of reliance on local raw materials. The ancient residents of SL-21 and SL-22 produced informal tools with locally available chert. Conversely, lithic debitage collected from structure group SL-25 indicates importation of raw materials from outside the San Lorenzo settlement cluster.

",Maya: Classic,Paleoethnobotany,Landscape Archaeology,"Terrace construction for agriculture was integral to the survival and growth of ancient Maya centers in the Lowland Neotropics. Terraces supplied communities with food for consumption and trade, materials for construction and goods production, and plants of medicinal and ritual significance. Research into ancient Maya agricultural practices have been largely situated in wetlands contexts, known to be sites of extensive landscape modification for agricultural purposes. Nevertheless, terraces are also identified integrated into the architectural arrangement of the cores of large urban centers throughout the Maya Lowlands. This paper discusses one such set of terraces, built and maintained adjacent to the public monumental core of Classic-period La Milpa, the third largest ancient Maya urban center in Belize. Excavations conducted on this system of terraces, positioned in the shadow of the three largest monumental temples at La Milpa, uncovered a series of modestly constructed retaining walls spanning the crest and shoulders of a 7m-high limestone outcrop. This presentation examines some of the preliminary results from these excavations, and provides a discussion of the methods that will be used to identify the types of plants that were cultivated on these urban terraces, emphasizing macro-botanical, phytolith, and starch analysis.",Symposium,NA,Debora_Trein,4,15,4,Th-morning

In a reflection of Maya cosmological beliefs, the plaza was seen as a representation of, and a portal to the primordial sea, the watery underworld from which all things originate. This connection is evident in various ways throughout the region, from special dedicatory deposits to decorative architecture and iconography. This presentation explores that cosmological salience through the recent excavations at Tutu Uitz Na, a large intermediate elite residential and ceremonial group situated in the Belize Valley, in the hinterland of the Late-Terminal Classic (AD 700-900) polity of Lower Dover. Tutu Uitz Na rose earlier, during the Middle Preclassic (1000-400 BC). The initial founding of the group saw the placement of a consecratory ritual deposit of artifacts associated with the watery underworld: figurines, marine shell, and an estimated 26 million river snails, all laid beneath the plaza. Excavations at a nearby commoner patio group have revealed a similar Middle Preclassic deposit beneath the patio.

These murals were the birthplace of the Feathered Serpent. My research proposes that the Feathered Serpent of Teotihuacan was a new deity serving as a symbol of the city; conceived in direct opposition to the jaguars used to symbolize kingship in contemporary Mayan polities. Past studies have treated the murals of Teotihuacan as either literal representation of supernatural deities or as a set of signs to be translated like a language. This study concludes that there is an intermediate interpretation wherein the feathered serpent is both a god and a symbol of identity. This is found in the representations of Teotihuacanos outside of Teotihuacan and outsiders within the barrios of Teotihuacan.

I combine a practice approach with the chaîne opératoire and behavior chains methods to analyze technical and social acts involving dress objects. The analysis starts with one segment of the actions involving dress—the actual act of dressing. The study includes only court scenes that appear to memorialize historic events, although some of the observations and conclusions can be applied to other kinds of scenes and other media. After identifying the elements of dress, we can see how the Maya combined them into ensembles and then how these ensembles interacted with non-dress objects and social acts in the Maya court. Maya artists used dress and non-dress objects to help the Maya audience understand what the scenes on the vases were depicting. This paper will address three aspects of male dress as depicted on the polychrome vases commonly used for drinking various beverages. Head gear and material objects provide evidence for three propositions. Dress ensembles 1) were shared throughout the Maya Lowlands; 2) were connected to known titles; and 3) were used to represent a hierarchy of social positions within the court.",Symposium,NA,Charles_Cheek,3.5,13,3.5,Th-morning

The authors numerically integrated meteoroid-sized particles released by Comet Halley as early as 1404 BC to identify years within the Maya Classic Period, AD 250-909, when Eta Aquariid outbursts might have occurred. Outbursts determined by computer model were then compared to specific events in the Maya record to see if any correlation existed between the date of the event and the date of the outburst. The model was validated by successfully explaining several outbursts around the same epoch in the Chinese record. Some outbursts likely observed by the Maya were due to recent revolutions of Comet Halley, within a few centuries, and some to resonant behavior in older Halley trails, of the order of a thousand years.

Incised animal, architecture, hieroglyph, and human forms adorn the brick slabs of principal buildings of Comalcalco’s ceremonial core. However, their inward-facing, or concealed, orientation rendered these markings invisible. Because monumental architecture benefited from the labor of non-elites, the purposeful placement of the incised designs strongly suggests a system of messaging in their invisibility. While Comalcalco occupied a strategic location near the Grijalva River, on the edge of Maya territory, its architectural vaulting resembles that of Palenque, indicating a close relationship between the two sites. In ancient Mesoamerica the invisible or concealed wields great power and consequence; at Comalcalco this lack of visibility may be inextricably tied to its peripheral placement within Palenque’s socio-political orbit as well as the greater Maya region. This paper explores several possibilities, none mutually exclusive. Are the incised and concealed bricks of Comalcalco tangible evidence of resistance from those who formed them?

This contextual analysis identifies the anatomical and cultural attributes of the dwarf motif and interprets its meaning within the ancient Maya conception of time and their ideological integration of the natural and supernatural.

A spatial analysis of 45 depictions of short-statured individuals on archaeologically provenienced monuments reveals that the dwarf motif follows the trajectory of political power in the Maya lowlands, beginning within the Caracol-Calakmul polity and expanding with its reach. The dwarf motif appears at Tikal, in new stylistic configurations, upon its defeat of the Caracol-Calakmul alliance. Sites with flexible allegiances display the dwarf motif as a combination of local and regional stylistic elements. Evidence from small, dependent sites and regional superpowers reveals ancient Maya artists adapting broadly shared iconography to express locally the relationship between identity and power.

Monumental depictions of dwarves associate with symbols of liminality, implying that the Maya channeled the ‘otherness’ of dwarves into a visual metaphor for transition.

Many structures have a single, clear façade, for instance, conceptualized as a literal face. Northern sites, with their toothy-jawed monster buildings, express this idea with particular directness. Stairways and sculptural adjuncts, like altars and stelae, are integral elements that contribute to the idea of facing, both literally and metaphorically, and, as such, are critical to the visual identity of many Maya sites. With a few notable exceptions, scholarly attention often focuses on isolating and analyzing associated texts and patronage as they relate to dynastic agendas, historical chronologies, or infrastructure supporting elaborate ceremonies. The present work acknowledges the importance, and interrelated nature, of Northern Lowland plaza features like stairs, altars, and three-dimensional sculpture. In doing so, we begin to explore how discrete formatting choices, combined with object selection and placement, impact viewers’ spatial experiences. Ultimately our work strongly supports the reading of Maya architecture as a performative framework.

Archaeological research at Oxpemul reflects occupation continuity from the Formative through Classic periods.  However, hieroglyphic inscriptions indicate a late fluorescence in the mid to late eighth century.  This paper explains this seeming contradiction from the perspective of broader geopolitical dynamics, particularly the rivalry between Calakmul and Tikal. Unlinke other centers in Uxte’tuun, the dynastic history of Oxpemul is silent during the height of the Kaanul (Snake) Dynasty during the ‘Three Kings Period’ (AD 635-730), when Calakmul exerted direct rulership over subordinate kingdoms in Uxte’tuun. This could reflect either stagnation and decline, or a later rewriting of history following major political upheaval in the region. Following the decline of the Snake Dynasty, Oxpmeul undertook a major campaign of monument construction, with kings holding both the local ‘stone throne’ and the enigmatic ‘bat head’ emblem glyph. These data indicate that Oxpemul benefitted from the decline of its more powerful neighbor and rose to regional preeminence under the aegis of Tikal.

Soil sampling was conducted along two terrace platforms and soils were analyzed using the ascorbic acid method for phosphorus determination in order to develop an index of phosphorus availability.

However, the development of these cities is the exception, rather than the norm, since the majority of Maya sites did not reach such enormous proportions, yet many of them likely qualified as cities from a functional standpoint. Hence, a research on non-massive cities, “from the bottom up,” is crucial to understand the development of ancient Maya urbanism. Investigations at the archaeological sites of Chan Chich, in northwestern Belize, and Kiuic, in the Puuc zone of the Yucatán Peninsula, have recovered evidence of emerging and established monumental precincts during the early Middle Preclassic and Late Classic period, respectively. The different social and political developments of these sites are in tandem with the construction of architectonic complexes defined as royal courts, the heart of ancient cities. In this paper, using stratigraphic, architectural, and artifactual evidence, we examine the role of non-dynastic cities in the urbanization of the Maya lowlands.

However, there is reason to be cautious about this assessment. While several recent studies have shown correlations between increased temperatures and conflict on the time-scale of years to decades, correlations over such short-term timescales may be misleading. The effects of anthropogenic climate change will likely go on for centuries and we know that long-term effects can be substantially different from short-term ones. Therefore, it is important that we investigate the century-scale effects of increasing temperature on conflict levels. With this in mind, we analyzed three long-term historical conflict records—one from the Classic Maya region, one from Europe, and one from China, each spanning multiple centuries. Using a recently developed time-series regression method, we compared each conflict record to several regional temperature reconstructions. We found clear evidence for a positive relationship in the Classic Maya case, but our results were more complicated for the other two cases. Thus, while changes in temperature can sometimes lead to changes in conflict levels, they do not always do so.

Moreover, the previous study indicate that this village might have been closely connected to San Andres, which is the religious, political, and economic center in the region. However, due to limited research, the extent of control of the elite of San Andres over the commoners of Joya de Ceren remains unclear. Therefore, the author recently conducted an archaeological investigation at San Andres. The results revealed that in San Andreas, the major occupation and construction of public architecture developed after the Loma Caldera eruption.

This paper synthesizes new and old data on sites, intrasite spatial organization, and material culture from the Mezcalapa Delta for a synopsis on prehispanic settlement history, settlement patterns, and interpretations on intra- and interregional identities in the Western Chontalpa. These sources suggest low populations during Olmec times, growth in the Late Formative, a hiatus in the Early Classic, and significant growth in the Middle-Late Classic when the first states appeared. The greatest political centralization was in the coastal-levee transition zone, without significant incorporation in trade networks, suggesting a tributary economy focused on diverse local resources. The people of the region cannot be viewed as Olmec, Chicanel, Maya, Nahua or their subjects. Instead, changing local to interregional layers of cultural identities are interpreted for Formative to Late Classic times, which in the latter were variably negotiated by class.

From the Preshipanic period to the present time the San Martín Pajapan volcano has been considered a natural place of the landscape with cultural significance, which is indicated by the presence of archaeological remains on its summit. The most remarkable archaeological element of this volcano is a monumental Olmec sculpture, which iconographic attributes suggest that it could have been carved during the Preclassic period. However, most of the ceramic materials found in association with the sculpture were dated by Alfonso Medellín Zenil to the Late Classic period. The temporal difference between the Olmec sculpture and the ceramic materials points out a problematic of the archaeological context. Thus, in this paper I’ll present a revision of the archaeological remains of the San Martín Pajapan volcano to solve such problematic. The results of this analysis indicate that, contrary to Medellín Zenil´s idea, the ceramic materials associated with the sculpture correspond to the Epi-Olmec and Protoclassic period of the Gulf Coast region.",Symposium,NA,Alberto_Ortiz Brito,2.5,9,2.5,Th-morning

Olmec Jade Artifacts as Elite Tools, Ornaments, and Inalienable Goods",Mesoamerica: Gulf Coast,Olmec,Experimental Archaeology,Social and Political Organization,"Recent research has re-identified certain enigmatic Gulf Coast Olmec greenstone artifacts as elite versions of textile-making tools. These artifacts, which include Middle Formative picks, figural celts, clamshell and plaque pendants, and objects designated as “spoons,” were likely used by elites as both functional objects and high-status adornment, as illustrated in the contemporary sculpture. Most examples of these artifacts are found in caches and graves of distant and/or later civilizations, apparently after they had experienced long use-lives; while still identifiable, most are extensively reworked and could no longer function as tools, becoming primarily symbolic—or their symbolism had been co-opted and transformed through recarving and recycling. Analysis of the few examples found in Formative period graves reveals considerable use-wear and breakage, re-sharpening, and reshaping; some were reworked to the point where they are barely recognizable, apparently retired only after they were largely unidentifiable. Such find contexts suggest that these artifacts functioned as inalienable goods—revered, elite possessions that were reserved, inherited, and treasured as symbols of association and status. Perhaps even more significant, the fact that these tools also served as status symbols suggests that in these Formative societies, social status could be gained through personal agency as well as heritage.",Symposium,NA,Billie_Follensbee,2.5,9,2.5,Th-morning

Experimental archaeological analysis revealed that some made a variety of avian sounds, along with several other unidentified sounds. The whistles were played and recorded using a B-flat tuner that then allowed the recording of the range for each working whistle.  Variations in notes and performed sounds varied based on whether the player approached them as whistles, flutes, or trumpets and the body size and lung capacity of the player.

Situated on top of the natural coastal choke-point of Cerro Bernal, Fracción Mujular would have had close access to important trading routes used throughout Mesoamerica’s history; a detail that is evident in the material culture recovered in excavations.  With a diverse ceramic assemblage and obsidian from at least 14 different sources, it is clear that Fracción Mujular was connected to trading partners from across Mesoamerica.

Homogeneous data obtained in AMS and MS1 indicate that this site was occupied successively by groups, at first hunter-gatherers then horticulturalists, from the beginning of the Holocene. Similarities between ceramics and lithic industries from MS1 and AMS suggest that it could be a unique archaeological ensemble in litho-ceramic horizons.

Among these, Campo Laborde and La Moderna, two kill/scavenging and processing sites in the border of ancient swamps have provided 11 taxon dates (Megatherium americanum and Doedicurus clavicaudatus) which range between 9730 and 6550 14C years BP. Recent excavations in the Campo Laborde site, as well as detailed geoarchaeological studies and newly obtained amino acid radiocarbon dates, challenge the hypothesis of the Pleistocene megamammals’ late survival in this region. In this presentation we will discuss new data considering the site formation processes of creek floodplains in the Pampas, in which the Holocene deposits are biased and the pedogenesis was intense. The studies in both locations suggest that the percolation of organic matter form upper layers would contaminate and rejuvenate the dates obtained from bone collagen.

What is the inspiration for these myths? How do they relate to taphonomic processes that affect deceased organisms? This paper addresses these questions in an Andean context by comparing pre-Hispanic narratives of lithification to post-mortem biological processes. In the Andes, tales of lithification focus on ancestors and local heroes, who, in their petrified state, continue to interact with the living by mediating between their descendants and supernatural deities. Ethnographies and ethnohistories describe large upright stones (huancas) and natural stone formations (huacas) who received the same care from their descendants as mummified ancestral remains and contextual evidence has allowed examples of modified and unmodified stone huancas to be identified in the archaeological record. The equivalency in the treatment of huancas and mummified ancestors raises interesting questions regarding the conceptual relationship between stone and the dead. One possible explanation argues Andean people were motivated to create this association by the desire to transfer qualities of stone (durability) to their ancestors. However, processes of lithification (fossilization) are not purely abstract mythologies. Could Andean beliefs regarding lithification also represent a compressed and abstracted interpretation of taphonomic processes?",Symposium,NA,Melissa_Litschi,2.75,10,2.75,Th-morning

The flood buried the Middle Sicán capital of Sicán with fluvial deposits 1.0 to 1.5 m thick. During this calamitous process that may have lasted many months, three episodes of large-scale human sacrifice of well over 200 individuals who were overwhelmingly healthy young to adult males took place near the center of the Gran Plaza of Sicán. There are suggestions of possible live burials. Efforts aimed at the clarification of victim identities and life histories are ongoing, however, the abundance of serving vessels and food remains indicate correspondingly large-scale feasting events that were closely associated in time and space.

However, until now the archaeological record of the Moche Valley has not yielded bioarchaeological evidence of Gallinazo violence. We present the case of a multiple burial recovered from the rural fishing village of Pampa La Cruz, Huanchaco (50 BC/AD100-AD 500). The remains recovered show evidence of severe trauma. These individuals provide us with insight into the practices of violence during this time and allow us to explore the role that violence may have played both in Gallinazo society and in the rise of Moche hegemony.

However, heritage management professionals in often employ the term ‘sustainable’ synonymously with 'collaborative' rather than as a coherent methodology or strategic approach aimed at preserving heritage sites and landscapes. The thinness of the literature on sustainable archaeological site management may pertain to the difficulty heritage managers have in articulating frameworks as advocated for in the prevailing decolonization and indigenous theory underpinning heritage-based sustainability efforts. Throughout Latin America, this problem is further complicated by a distinct historical-colonial legacy that preserved the 'local' as well as the 'indigenous' and promulgated a criollo, or mestizo, identity as the unifying national figure of public imagination.

The figures are reduced to brief combinations of lines and are placed within compositions that are tightly filled with dots, spirals and waves. The compression of space and expressionistic handling of paint emblematizes the Cajamarca Cursive style. While the compulsion to fill space has been previously thought of as a motif or filler, the lines accentuate figures and create movement within the image. The proliferation of a small corpus of representational imagery on a variety of Cajamarca bowls, spoons and jars indicates that the image held cultural and social value and was an abbreviated version of a vast body of esoteric knowledge.

During the Middle Horizon, Peru (AD 600 – 1000) the Wari Empire expanded from its capital in the Ayacucho highlands to cover a region of the Andes spanning over 1000km within present-day Peru. The empire embarked on large-scale infrastructural projects (roadways, agricultural terracing and irrigation works, political and administrative systems, etc.) and had a political economy built on a combination of strategies, including resource control and the specialized production and distribution of both utilitarian and special-purpose goods. The empire relied on the vertical ecology of the Andes to capitalize on regional resources, and to draw those regions into the Wari interaction sphere. This research seeks to understand the intersecting relationships between regions, resources and Wari power as enacted through the production, distribution and consumption of obsidian and other resources within the Wari capital and hinterland territories.

In central and south Texas, a distinct archaeological culture, Toyah, spans some 400 years, 1250-1650 CE. The hallmark projectile point and first systemic, locally-produced ceramic tradition in the area have intrigued archaeologists for over a hundred years; interpretations of the phenomena have been unsatisfactory as to the factors responsible for such a distinctive change in material culture within a foraging society. This paper argues that feasting theory provides an interpretative and explanatory lens for Toyah. With increasing population pressure on the landscape, interactions between foraging and farming groups across southern North America increased during the late Pre-Hispanic period. Large feasts, which the Spanish called mitotes, become important social mechanisms for crucial intergroup meetings for trade as well as political, marriage, and spiritual negotiations.

Nevertheless, residents of Achiutla did indeed have access to European glazed wares, and used tin-enameled majolicas with considerable frequency, in particular. I attribute this pattern to indigenous nobles having served as primary interlocutors between Spanish authorities and their broader native constituencies following the social upheaval of the Conquest.

My paper analyzes acoustics at the late Maya capital of Chichen Itza. Sound—especially the human voice, animals, music, ritual, and dancing—were part of Chichen Itza’s atmosphere. An analysis of soundscapes, along with the intersection of architecture, planning, and acoustics, augments what is known about the site’s settlement, rituals, epigraphy, and imagery. For example, sounds could be heard in only a part of this large site. Consequently, sound at ground level and inside or atop buildings can be understood as limited resources available to different audiences and sectors of the site. Using digital archaeology to plot soundscapes, I consider how acoustics may have influenced the site plan; how acoustics may have embodied political and social concerns; and how Maya notions about sound expand an understanding of Maya places.

This paper presents the results of the 2017 test excavations of a sample of the A plaza buildings. Maya plazas are typically conceived of as large open places for ritual and political performance. However, these excavation findings suggest that this period was not static, and city occupants reworked their relationships to the monumental site core by reconfiguring the layout of the main plaza and reusing materials from earlier buildings. These practices of reconfiguration and reuse likely even continue into the later part of the Postclassic period. This paper considers how this transitional period at the site fits in with trends of reuse and reconfiguration throughout northern Belize and parts of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula during a period of instability and change across the Maya lowlands.

For over a century, dozens of researchers have proposed different causes that may have driven this complex process. The last few decades have witnessed the academic community’s opinion converge on the notion that many different social and environmental factors, operating at likewise diverse scales, somehow contributed to a temporally gradual and spatially heterogeneous disruption of the demographic, political, and cultural patterns known to have characterized the Classic Maya. This paper builds on this progress by attempting to quantify the relative influence of certain factors on the Maya region's long-term trajectory. It presents an abstract spatial simulation model of Maya demography, subsistence, and trade over a 3000 year period. It implements relatively generic manifestations of what processes were relevant to the growth, collapse, and regeneration of the Maya system. This abstraction permits quicker model execution times, which then facilitates using data mining and sensitivity analysis methodology to quantify how certain stressor categories contribute to the presence or absence of long term societal collapse. The relative importance of these stressors according to the simulation is then compared to the amount of research attention they tend to receive.

The Aztecs have often dominated the landscape of Mesoamerica while the Huastecs have been seen as something somewhat separate. At first glance the difference in Aztec and Huastec sculptural tradition might seem to reaffirm this disconnect. By focusing on male figurative sculpture and how it reflects the construction of gender identity we see that despite clear differences there is a core ideology which connects them through shared traditions and worldview. This examination also reveals how Aztec and Huastec depictions of, and reactions to, male nudity indicate how both cultures use shared ideas of gender and identity to address unique social and political concerns within each group. Ideas of maleness reflected in these sculptures reveal the anxiety of the Aztecs as relative newcomers trying assert themselves as a cosmic and political center of the Mesoamerican world while at the same time solidly giving the Huastec a home in that world.

Weaning likely occurred between 3-6 years of age when C3 foods, perhaps squash, were introduced in the weaning diet. By 6 years of age isotopic values matched those of adults.

Though the doctrine “as in life, so in death” can have some merit for archaeological inquiry, viewing mortuary ritual in this manner ignores the social act itself, which is one of the most intimate, personal, and weighted actions humans produce, serving, among other roles, to return the society to homeostasis in the wake of the loss of a member. In interpreting mortuary ritual as a means to resolve a social death within a group, close ties emerge with ethnic and group identity. Rather than a passive reflection of a culture in life, mortuary ritual is an act constitutive of ethnicity.

Although Mesoamerican archaeology has largely evidence about representations of aging in different sources of information (textual and iconographic) to a broader consideration of funerary practices, approaches of old age as an identity category has been neglected of the archaeological inquiry. This article explores the funerary practices of elderly at Monte Alban and how it contributes to the understanding about the longevity in the past and the attributions based on age in the context of the organization of the domestic labor in complex societies. Aged bodies were selected considering pathologies and markers of senescence that include, for example, joint diseases, osteoporosis, traces of wear and tooth loss (n=40; 12,1%). Some symbolical aspects of longevity were introduced in the funerary practices to give meanings to the preservation of the memory of the house.

This project specifically considers the temporal, geographic, and religious variations which impact these burials.
Pre-Modern Finnish identities; of “child” and “adult”, “male” and “female” are explored through the detailed analysis of the garments with which these children were interred. This also offers the opportunity to consider what childhood meant vis-a-vis adult society, particularly in cases of co-burial. The roles to into which children were encultured, and the unique boundary between “dead” and “alive” are explored through role identity theory, socialization theory and material and technological choice in the funerary textiles and manner of burial.

",Bronze Age,Bioarchaeology/Skeletal Analysis,Gender and Childhood,"The Early Bronze Age (EBA) is often characterized as a period of emerging social hierarchies dominated by high status warrior-males. Analysis of human skeletal remains in their mortuary context has the potential to challenge this assumption and inform more nuanced understandings of gender and social status. Individuals (n=285) at the EBA Maros cemetery at Ostojicevo, Serbia (ca. 1900-1500 B.C.E.) exhibit a strong correlation between biological sex and funerary treatment, specifically body orientation. Among the subset of adult (>18 years-at-death) biological males buried in a “female” orientation, several stand out for either their unique physical characteristics (e.g., tall stature, robusticity), or association with “female” prestige offerings (e.g., copper pins, beaded sashes). The relationship between “masculinity” and social status is further complicated by gendered differences in the social perception and embodiment of physical trauma. While there is an association between trauma, male orientation, and weaponry, most individuals with skeletal evidence of antemortem or perimortem trauma did not receive special funerary treatment. Through the examination of multiple lines of evidence, including grave goods, orientation, and evidence of trauma, this paper argues that transgenderism seems to have been as highly regarded as other elements of traditional “masculine” identities at Ostojicevo.",Symposium,NA,Katherine_Pompeani,2.75,10,2.75,Th-morning

The selection and combination of sexual attributes and decorative elements such as clothing and jewelry were changeable strategies for depicting social identity. In contrast to earlier methods for depicting feminine and masculine bodies, Teotihuacan period figurines emphasized decorative cultural attributes over physical ones—a strategy that quickly spread to rural communities in the region.

When did Neanderthals disappear? How long did anatomically modern humans (AMH) and Neanderthals overlap, and what implications did this have for interaction, acculturation or interbreeding? Without reliable time control, these questions are unanswerable and unravelling the Paleolithic remains a distant and virtually unachievable goal.

One of the main areas of improvement has been in chemical pretreatment and sample decontamination which has resulted in superior purification, particularly of bone proteins targeted for dating.

We have used optimized techniques of AMS dating as well as OSL dating, coupled with Bayesian modeling, to produce robust site chronologies.

A magnetic anomaly has been identified close to a cluster of artifacts. Micromorphological analyses indicate site formation processes with relatively little post-depositional modification. This is further supported by fabric analysis. The site is one of the earliest known sites, to date, with evidence for an association of fire and human activity.

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Material Culture and Technology,"Despite more than a century of scholarship, our knowledge about the use of stone artifacts remains relatively sparse. Major advances in the analysis of microscopic wear have been the primary focus of much previous research. However, post-depositional processes and the logistics of microscopic analysis limit sample sizes in these studies. New approaches that quantify macroscopic damage patterns on the assemblage scale provide a robust basis for drawing behavioral inferences about hominin tool use. Here we apply these new techniques to a large assemblage of stone artifacts from multiple excavations at Elandsfontein (1 Ma – 780Ka) from the Western Cape of South Africa. Measures of damage location, continuity, and extent provide intriguing insights into the variability in tool use patterns. This analysis is combined with experimental studies of tool use and their subsequent damage patterns. Results indicate differences in tool use across an ancient landscape. These differences correlate with complimentary data sets from across Elandsfontein. This further supports this method in the investigation of tool use in Paleolithic contexts.

BP,"Africa: Sub-Saharan Africa
",Other,Lithic Analysis,Caves and Rockshelters,"Lithic miniaturization, the systematic production of small stone artifacts by controlled fracture, was a pervasive feature of late Pleistocene lithic technology. Smaller toolkits enabled humans to exploit raw materials more efficiently, to produce composite tools more effectively, to reduce a wider range of rocks, and to increase mobility by lightening toolkits. These benefits allowed humans to occupy a wider range of ecological niches. Archaeologists working in southern Africa have long acknowledged lithic miniaturization’s importance in framing the region’s late Pleistocene prehistory. However, to date archaeologists have conducted very little inter-region comparative research on the topic. This paper presents the results of a comparative lithic technological study between Klipfonteinrand and Sehonghong- two large rock-shelters located in southern Africa’s winter and summer rainfall zones respectively. Evidence from these sites shows not only a comparative technological approach’s effectiveness but also that lithic miniaturization expresses itself differently in different regions. Patterned variability of this nature fits a model of strategic behavioral variability. To gauge variability in prehistoric lithic miniaturization, archaeologists need to adopt more contextual and comparative methods of stone tool analysis.

",Paleolithic,Zooarchaeology,Migration,"Work in the Nefud Desert, Saudi Arabia, has been fundamental for establishing the importance of the Arabian Peninsula for Pleistocene hominin populations and their dispersals out of Africa. Recent palaeontological and archaeological exploration in the Western Nefud Desert has uncovered numerous fossiliferous palaeolake deposits and associated archaeology. Fossil assemblages include taxa with both African and Eurasian affinities and indicate a greater diversity in large mammals than resides in the region today. Furthermore, the presence of species such as Hippopotamus and Alcelaphus strongly support an ameliorated climate with expansive grasslands and large, perennial lakes. Favourable conditions likely permitted and promoted an influx of taxa, while subsequent climatic deterioration would have resulted in faunal retreat and/or extirpation. The presence of hominins in Arabia during the Pleistocene is evidenced by fossil remains, stone tools and anthropogenically modified bone, and their dispersal into Arabia was most likely tied to the establishment of favourable conditions and concomitant influx of large herbivores. This is perhaps best exemplified by the relatively diverse large mammal assemblage at Ti’s al Gadah (TAG) and the accompanying evidence for anthropogenically modified bone from various fossiliferous deposits, suggesting repeated hominin dispersal events into the Western Nefud Desert during the Pleistocene.",Symposium,NA,Mathew_Stewart,4,15,4,Th-morning

",Paleolithic,Digital Archaeology: GIS,Taphonomy and Site Formation,"The Lower Paleolithic site of Dmanisi, Georgia, is well known for its rich archaeological and paleontological deposits, which include bones from at least five individuals attributed to Homo erectus. Taphonomic analyses show that carnivores contributed greatly to the accumulation of faunal material, while contributions by hominins were present, but uncommon. Recent excavations in the hominin-bearing layers of Block 2 at Dmanisi have revealed a complex underlying basalt formation that likely dictated much of the site formation processes, both biotic and abiotic. Combining spatial patterning with a 3D model of the excavation generated using Agisoft Photoscan, we identify several areas where the basalt, and the pseudo-karstic pipe and gully formations, have constrained the deposition of material. 3D bone orientations in many areas show strong correlations to the underlying shape of the basalt formation. In addition, spatial patterning of the lithic and faunal material differs depending on stratigraphic layer, which is also controlled largely by the basalt and pipe/gully formations.

Also addressed are the substantial problems of documenting and dating such sites.  Finally, I conclude with the implications of systematic seafaring in human evolution, especially as it relates to the considerable skills required for seafaring, such as long-term planning, adequate technology, navigation abilities, and, ultimately, “why” such activities would even be undertaken in the first place.

Sociopolitical Strategies in Northwestern Scandinavia in the Early Bronze Age,Europe: Northern Europe,Bronze Age,Other,Social and Political Organization,"Along the northwestern coast of Scandinavia the reliance and utilisation of the sea set the stage for a more advance sociopolitical organization. The technological innovations prompted by the Late Neolithic (i.e. ship technology), turned the sea into a connective arena of interaction and trade. This is seen with the widespread distribution of finely crafted Jutish flint daggers from Late Neolithic I, followed by a steady increase of metal, burial mounds, and settlement sites in Late Neolithic II and the Early Bronze Age. Despite having a material culture expressive of a region well-integrated within a Nordic World System, these societies are juxtaposed by a long coastline of climatic and ecological distinctiveness that forces insular practices in subsistence and organization. This paper will explore the contrasting practices in sociopolitical organization and the strategies implemented to take advantage of the local resource potential. The dependency of trade is identified as a key element to uphold power in certain regions, exercised through coercive strategies, but the paper also points to the inevitable fragility of such an organisation and the more long-term stability of cooperative strategies.

",Bronze Age,Bioarchaeology/Skeletal Analysis,Mortuary Archaeology,"The Apuseni Mountains of southwest Transylvania, Romania, are amongst the richest gold and copper procurement zones in the world. Metals from this region helped fuel the rise of inequality across Europe during Late Prehistory, and the area is also home to a rich mortuary record, with archaeological survey identifying over one hundred mounded tomb cemeteries belonging to Bronze Age communities. However, none of these cemeteries have been fully excavated and only a small sample of skeletons have been studied. Here, we describe the results of bioarchaeological analysis of human skeletal remains from a sample of previously unanalyzed Early Bronze Age sites that encompass a significant degree of environmental and cultural variability, including upland cemeteries with stone-covered cairns, as well as lowland cemeteries with earthen cairns. These cemeteries show evidence of diverse mortuary treatments, including primary burials, secondary burials, and commingled interments. Our analyses assess age, sex, health, and funerary treatment, providing preliminary information about how mortuary treatment intersected with aspects of identity and lived experience.

",Bronze Age,Mortuary Analysis,Mortuary Archaeology,"Mortuary variability in European prehistory has long been perceived through the lens of Christian worldview from which the discipline of archaeology originally developed. Expectations rooted in this conceptual perspective inevitably shaped the ways how the archaeological record was approached and interpreted. As a case study we consider the Central European Bronze Age, on which we can deconstruct the traditional ‘textbook’ understanding of ancient funerary traditions. During this period, general development observed in formal cemeteries is characterised by the gradual shift from prevailing inhumation towards cremation, but with strikingly frequent finds of complete, partial, or disarticulated human skeletons in settlement pits and ditches.  We argue that what is usually regarded as a normative burial, or its opposite, i.e. seemingly careless and non-ritual deposition of human remains, may be a very problematic categorization. Gradually accumulated evidence suggests that the most visible forms of human burial in the archaeological record may not have been the dominant type of treatment of the dead. According to our research, secondary manipulation and fragmentation of human bodies, which was turning them into objects of cultural patrimony that could be shared and curated, seems to have been the most frequent destiny awaiting the deceased.",Symposium,NA,Ladislav_Smejda,3.25,12,3.25,Th-morning

In effect, the accumulation of clay, rubble and refuse on which houses are built and lives lived reflects daily actions, cultural events happening on longer cycles as well as environmental considerations. Therefore, the blend of things and matter that transited from the riverbed to houses, pots, and aggregated rubble and rubbish requires a special consideration: in this blend, things are not things and clay is no natural matter either. However, the breaking down of aggregates needs to be a mean to understand their formation as the aim is to consider the lump of clay and objects as a whole, a tell being more than the sum of its parts.

Thus, the extraction of information needed to make claims on how different societies distributed living areas in the house and in the greater village, can not always be examined in detail. For the purpose of this paper, I will examine how the sites of the Early Neolithic (6500-6000 BC) villages of sites such as Slatina and Mursalevo in Bulgaria can contribute greatly to these questions. The ritual burning of the houses from these communities, and the particularities the excavation of these houses require can contribute greatly to how archaeologists approach the first step of data collecting: excavating.

Economically, they furnished meat, milk, wool and manure, and served as draught animals for transport and tillage. Intersecting with their economic uses, they were also important socially, politically and ritually. It is relatively straightforward to determine the proportional representation and mortality profiles of the major species – cattle, sheep/goat and pig. While this provides insights into how and why animals were managed, it does not allow the detailed investigation of how individual animals were actually kept, how they were moved around the landscape, and how various nearby communities integrated their animal management practices. Isotopic approaches can offer insights into just these practices. We report the results of a multi-isotope study Early/Middle Iron Age domestic fauna (cattle, sheep/goat and pig) within a very constrained study area of the Oxfordshire Ridgeway, south-central England.

On the basis of newly collected and updated radiocarbon data on the dating of Neolithic mines and quarries in in Britain, Ireland and continental Northwest Europe, the paper will present the results of using these methods to compare the chronological distribution of mine and quarry exploitation with regional fluctuations in the population of early farmers and in the scale of forest clearance that they undertook, to test the hypothesis that the intensity of production depended on variation in the demand generated by the population and its clearance activities. It will do this by simulating large numbers of mine date samples on the assumption that they represent random samples of the population and clearance distribution and comparing these with the observed distribution.

While much excavation has focused on the Iron Age little work has focused on the role of warfare at that time. Discussions of warfare have led to antithetical conclusions by researchers utilizing the same material with much of the disagreement stemming from fundamentally different interpretations of equivocal evidence and assumptions about life in the period. Some of this is ultimately founded on untested models and questionable historic accounts. I propose a new method of approaching warfare utilizing what I am calling bellicose references as a way of cutting through and resolving many of the issues that have complicated the study of warfare. Based in Practice Theory, specifically the idea of habitus, bellicose references are a conceptual tool that shifts focus away from the presence or absence of warfare and instead puts the focus on how these materials manifest socially, putting the focus on human action and practice. I demonstrate the usefulness of this approach utilizing data from Wessex and show how this, in conjunction with other information from the region, gives a more holistic understanding of violence and conflict.",Symposium,NA,Eric_Harkleroad,3.25,12,3.25,Th-morning

For example, the end of the Neopalatial period on Crete occurred in the LM IB period; some researchers view LM IB destructive fires as indicative of human action during a phase of social and political instability, while others reason that destructive fires followed a massive natural disaster. Micromorphological evidence from archaeological sequences can correspond to occupational and transitional phases and provide information on transformations in the surrounding environment, creating a microecological narrative. These narratives can distill social responses to environmental stresses from the archaeological record. New micromorphological evidence from the 2013–2015 Palace and Landscape at Palaikastro excavations, from the previously unknown neighborhood on the southeast edge of the main Bronze Age town, identifies some of these socio-natural responses.

I begin in the late Early Bronze Age, with a small group of seals engraved with a novel composition type that set humans in a direct visual and conceptual parallel with lions. I then trace the re-invention of this parallel in the glyptic of the subsequent palatial periods. Here the seal’s position as a worn object was capitalized on, with the body of the beast engraved on the seal being juxtaposed with the body of the human wearer.

This paper discusses how peat serves such a role, sheds light on the how these processes affect the archaeological record, an aspect of environmental change that has been overlooked. During the colonization of Iceland in the 9th century AD, early Icelanders (Vikings) began to affect and be affected by local environments. Viking colonization led to rapid deforestation of woodland resources, resulting in soil loss and increased aeolian deposition. As wood was scarce, peat and turf were commonly used as fuel sources and construction materials in Iceland. Due to the ubiquity of these materials, changes in the quality of peat and turf potentially influenced past human behavior (i.e., fuel selection, resource management, and waste production) and the archaeological record (i.e., waste disposal, farm mound development, and landscape alteration). Using micromorphology and geochemical analyses on experimentally combusted peat from a continuous bog sequence, this research will identify compositional changes and shifts in fuel quality over time. These data will provide information on resource access, wealth distribution, site formation processes, and human-environment interactions.",Symposium,NA,Alicia_Sawyer,2.75,10,2.75,Th-morning

Medieval historical records, such as annals and Saints’ Lives, and archaeological data, such as the layout of monastic buildings, suggest that small communities of monks at early medieval Irish monasteries followed ascetic or austere ways of life. Contrastingly, historical and archaeological sources indicate that monks at late medieval monasteries, founded by English and continental religious orders, lived in large communities and interacted with lay or non-religious people. Historical texts also record that high-status Irish monks and nuns traveled throughout Ireland, Scotland, England, and continental Europe. However, documents record little information about lower status monks and lay people. Thus, it is unknown how frequently people traveled as part of monastic life and how frequently local individuals participated in monasticism. This study leverages unique burial contexts of 88 individuals at five Irish monastic sites spanning nine centuries (8th-16th centuries AD) through biogeochemical analysis of human bones and teeth based on three isotopic systems (radiogenic strontium, oxygen, and carbon), compared to a geological baseline of plant samples, to uncover patterns of medieval Irish mobility in connection to the changing practices of Irish monasticism.

",Other,Cultural Resources and Heritage Management,Public and Community Archaeology,"Heritage interpretation is one of the best methods for preserving cultural heritage since it assists a neighborhood in having a better understanding of the importance of its museums and historic sites. Lately, the world has witnessed the loss of many such sites in the Middle East. Therefore, the adaptation of the American models of interpretation would be ideal for addressing this problem.  This paper provides an example of the use of these methods of interpretation for the preservation of sites in Egypt. The current research took place in the Mallawi Museum in Minya, Egypt. This museum was looted in 2013 when people broke into the museum and stole and destroyed its objects. After the reopening of the museum in 2016, it was important to establish a community engagement project to assist the stakeholders in understanding the value of its cultural heritage sites. Intensive workshops were held in the museum to inform people about the significance of historical and archaeological sites in Minya by using several interpretative methods such as storytelling and living history. An assessment survey shows that this kind of project can make a significant impact in the effort to protect cultural heritage sites in the Middle East.",Symposium,NA,Heba_Abdelsalam,3.25,12,3.25,Th-morning

Although a published piece from the Eton College Collection, this is the first time extensive research has been performed on this unprovenanced artifact bought on the antiquities market in the late 1800s. Production of the bead occurred at the end of the Amarna Period during the reign of Tutankhamun and the return to orthodoxy of Egyptian culture.  A comprehensive physical analysis of the bead confirmed its material composition as faience and indicated the process utilized in its production. Through the in-depth analysis of the components of the image, the iconography established it as a potent fertility symbol representative of royal regeneration. Then, based on the findings, the original appearance of the bead and its associated collar has been reconstructed, followed by a suggestion of its function in Egyptian society.

",Iron Age,Mortuary Analysis,Monumentality,"This paper looks at how network theory and materiality may challenge progressive evolutionary models of complexity. Archaeologists working on the African continent have long argued against neoevolutionary models of complexity, advocating instead for understandings that promote dynamism and fluidity. However, the spectre of neoevolution still claims the public imagination: bigger still seems to be better even if we agree it really shouldn’t be. This paper aids in complicating these views by emphasizing how recent understandings of network theory and materiality shift the portrait of complexity from one of linear progression to one of social disconnection. More specifically, this paper explores how current ideas of materiality inherently flip our value system for how societies may be complex – so that bigger is not necessarily better, but the result of peoples attempts to deal with isolation, alienation, disconnection, and sometimes social instability.

At the confluence of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, port cities like Zeila and Berbera witnessed the arrival of Greek and Roman traders (ca. AD200) and Chinese merchants (ca. AD1300). Contacts with Muslim merchants from the Arabian Peninsula (ca. AD800) were particularly transformative, and by the tenth century, communities across Djibouti and Somaliland were converts. Scholars have hypothesized that pre-Islamic “monument sites” across the region—specifically, ancestor shrines and cairns—remained centers of ritual practice long after communities converted to Islam. This study seeks to test this hypothesis by identifying evidence of changes/continuities in ritual practice at a complex of monument sites along the Wadi Buleh in eastern Djibouti.

Food in West Africa is depicted by its primary historians as shrouded in continuous food insecurities and largely lacking differentiated cuisines. However, recent archaeological and historical research in Atlantic era West African foodways have highlighted the dynamic nature of West African foodways. Despite these advancement, the full processes through which American crops became integrated into local African foodways is poorly understood. This paper critically reviews how Africanist researchers have discussed the incorporation of American crops into local foodways. Building on these works, I show how we can trace the impacts of local food choices on the broader Atlantic trade through my proposed ethno-archaeological research in Ghana-Amedeka. This paper situates these issues within the Atlantic era in West Africa. The Atlantic trade brought with it networks of connections and change, however these interactions did not happen in vacuum. They occurred within local situated social, political, economic, and historical contexts.

",Chalcolithic,Other,Landscape Archaeology,"Ban Qala, a site located in the mountainous valley of Qara Dagh, was first identified by Iraqi archaeologists in the 1940s. In 2015, a survey performed by the Qara Dagh Regional Archaeological Project determined the archaeological relevance of the site, which was then chosen as subject of an archaeological investigation. A step trench on the southern slope of the site verified the presence of LC 1-2 (4800/4500-3850 B.C.E.) and LC 3-5 (3850-3100 B.C.E.) occupation levels. This paper will discuss the data collected and provide interpretations on the implication of the Late Chalcolithic period in the Qara Dagh Valley. The presence of stone tools, particularly obsidian, and the strategic position of Ban Qala on a corridor that leads east to the Shahrizor plain and west to Chamchamal, could suggest that the site participated in some form of trade. Finally, the recovery of several bevelled rim bowls in situ suggests that local ceramic production was being carried out within the context of a wide-spread Mesopotamian ceramic tradition. 
The Ban Qala excavation is one of the first conducted in the valley and will contribute to our knowledge on its occupational history, providing a regional perspective from the mountainous region of Northern Mesopotamia.

",Neolithic,Digital Archaeology: Simulation and Modeling,Social and Political Organization,"Extensive archaeological field work and multidisciplinary research in recent decades shows that communities of sedentary hunter-gatherers during the tenth millenium BC built the earliest presently known monumental structures during the PPNA (ca. 9600–8800 BC) at the ceremonial site of Göbekli Tepe and nearby PPNB settlement sites in present-day Urfa province, southeastern Turkey. However, the earliest evidence of agriculture dates to a later period (early PPNB, ca. 8750 BC, terminus post quem) or began further south (e.g., the Levant). We present a novel computational analysis of initial social complexity in these early Anatolian communities, based on Canonical Theory of politogenesis, evolutionary dynamics, and lines of evidence drawn from Göbekli Tepe and related Urfa sites. Theory and data are then used to create an agent-based model simulating the emergence of worship sites, other diffused cultural patterns, and the emergence of cultivation as may have occurred in the region during the PPNA and initial PPNB periods. The model is implemented in NetLogo. Along with other computational models of early social complexity, it aims to contribute to multidisciplinary understanding of prehistory, origins of civilization, and long-term culture change. Extensions of the model to other regions of politogenesis are also discussed. Dedicated to Klaus Schmidt.",Symposium,NA,Claudio_Cioffi-Revilla,2.25,8,2.25,Th-morning

",Bronze Age,Other,Social and Political Organization,"During the Late Chalcolithic (c. 4500-3100 BCE), the lowlands and highlands of southwest Asia became increasingly entangled both economically and culturally. Interaction during this time was organized through a network of colonial enclaves and diasporas. Following the collapse of this exchange network, the region underwent dramatic changes leading to increased regionalization and ruralization. Scholarly discourse posits that only after centuries of isolation and impoverishment there came a phase of renewed social complexity and interregional interaction during the second half of the third millennium BCE. However, while distinct cultural zones following the Late Chalcolithic display only very little contact in material culture, limited evidence suggests continued interregional exchange structured along very differently principles.
Based on new evidence from work at Kani Shaie in Iraqi Kurdistan, this paper argues that the distinct cultural zones between the Tigris River and the highest reaches of the Zagros chains maintained periodic interaction. This Zagros Interaction Sphere facilitated social and economic ties across dispersed communities inhabiting different ecological zones. These highland-lowland interactions characterize an alternative development of social complexity resulting in the formation of indigenous polities and ethnic identities that are often characterized as peripheral and small-scale to wider developments in Bronze Age southwest Asia.

",Bronze Age,Zooarchaeology,Ritual and Symbolism,"In this presentation, we will examine rituals of hunting and feasting in Late Bronze Age Tel Ifshar, a medium-size 4 ha site on Israel’s coastal plain. The Late Bronze Age in Israel was a time of social change as Egyptian influence—political, cultural, and religious—steadily increased in intensity, and became more and more entangled with the local Canaanite culture. At Ifshar, we have evidence for the phenomenon of feasting in the archaeological record through ceramics and faunal remains, and suggest viewing this activity as part of vertical patrimonial relationship in which the client gained capital and the patron reinforced the bond over the client. It has been argued, that ritualized feasting and conspicuous consumption played a significant role in maintaining the patrimonial system that is currently theorized to have been employed in Canaan. However, this role has mainly been discussed in relation to large sites and focused on the relationships between peers. This presentation seeks to shed light on the phenomenon of feasting and hunting at smaller, mid-level sites and what that could mean in the context of Canaanite society.

",Bronze Age,Bone Tool Analysis,Material Culture and Technology,"This paper investigates the production of bone artifacts during the Bronze Age (ca. 3000-1200 BCE) at the central Anatolian site of Kaman-Kalehöyük. At this time, small agrarian societies transformed into more complex polities and states, which gave way to a more centralized and specialized market economy. These transformations in sociopolitical and economic organization resulted in other changes as well. For example, animal exploitation patterns began to reflect a more regulated economy to meet food production, distribution, and consumption demands. Urbanized food management systems also had to meet the demands of craftspeople and specialist, if any, who might have preferred certain skeletal elements over others. In a rural site like Kaman-Kalehöyük, craftspeople, in particular, would use bone as raw materials readily and constantly available for production purposes. More specifically, we seek to elucidate whether preferences for specific bone elements reflect changes in the demands for consumer goods such as game pieces, jewelry, furniture inlays, archer’s thumb rings, bone shaft looms, and needles. More broadly, we aim to test whether there are correlations between changes in sociopolitical and economic organization and production of bone tools through time.

",Bronze Age,Digital Archaeology: Simulation and Modeling,Environment and Climate ,"Agent-based modeling of land use not only illustrates how ancient production mechanisms evolve but such models also have the power to reconstruct changes in spatio-temporal changes in the dynamics of surface processes in relation with the changes in climatic conditions and varying type and intensity of human land use. Early Bronze Age-I at Arslantepe represents a time period when the paleoclimatic dynamics changed towards more arid conditions while the economy of the site shifted from intensive irrigation farming to site-tethered pastoralism. Concurrently, the social organization moved from hierarchic to heterarchic structure. Extensive geoarchaeological research around the site suggests low rate of sediment deposition for this phase. Under more arid climatic conditions, it is expected that various modes of land use would have different impacts on the surface processes. The results of numerous scenarios tested in agent-based models at Arslantepe during the Early Bronze Age-I show that the rates of erosion and deposition change as patterns of precipitation and the mode of land use change. The results of simulations prove that the shift in economic and social organization alleviated the environmental disturbance that the residents of Arslantepe were faced with at the onset of the Middle Holocene.

",Historic,Remote Sensing/Geophysics,Landscape Archaeology,"This paper presents the preliminary results of a collaborative project that seeks to develop a deep learning model for automated detection of qanat shafts on CORONA Satellite Imagery. Increasing quantity of air and space-borne imagery available to archaeologists and advances in computational science has created an emerging interest in automated archaeological detection. Previous studies have applied machine learning algorithms for detection of archaeological sites and off-site features, with varying success rates. In the last few years, tremendous success has been achieved in image recognition through deep learning, a category of supervised machine learning which is based on hierarchical representation learning. We have chosen to examine the application of deep convolutional neural networks for automated archaeological detection focusing on qanats. The methodological merit of the project is that qanat shafts are one of the most suitable archaeological features for pattern recognition. The analytical merit is that conducting comparative studies of qanat systems at a regional scale is predicated on mapping massive number of qanat shafts, which is impossible manually.  Processing of big data generated through machine learning would allow us to examine how this sustainable water supply technology has been adapted to a remarkably wide range of water deficit environments.",Symposium,NA,Mehrnoush_Soroush,3.25,12,3.25,Th-morning

",Historic,Survey,Landscape Archaeology,"The landscapes of the Sasanian Empire have long been viewed as massive and state-sponsored development projects, in particular in politically and economically core zones. Despite these unparalleled understandings, our knowledge of peripheries and their connection with the sociopolitical organization of the time have still remained as some of the key gaps in the studies of late antiquity. To address these questions, I examine the settlement expansion, water management systems and agricultural intensification along the Sirwan/Diyala River in the Kurdistan Region. With the application of satellite images for landscape classification, GIS-based hydrological modeling, proxy records to reconstruct the climatic conditions, and combined with results of archaeological fieldwork, this paper offers that a bottom-up approach to intensification will shed new light on the role of local communities and the degree of their autonomy. It presents that large-scale projects and dependence on the centralized political authority were not always agriculturally required and a different intensification strategy with the integration of both irrigation and rain-fed practices could sustain a growing population. I further discuss the great potential of this research as a case study to unravel the role of peripheries in broader socio-political and economic transformations during the Sasanian period.",Symposium,NA,Mitra_Panahipour,3.25,12,3.25,Th-morning

",Other,Survey,Environment and Climate ,"Recent research in the borderlands have increased our knowledge on the irrigation systems and urbanization plans of the Sasanian Empire in the late antiquity. In particular, surveys and excavations in the Mughan Steppe indicate that irrigation canals connected nearly all Sasanian settlements. Evidence suggests that after the 7th century AD most of the elaborate settlement system was abandoned and its irrigation infrastructure went out of use. While the exact date of this abandonment is unclear, it is possible that the collapse of the irrigation system itself could have brought an end to the Sasanian settlements which happened before appearing of the Muslim army in the region in the mid-7th century. In this paper, I will present evidence of climate change that could have caused the abandonment of the Sasanian irrigation systems and associated settlements. Unlike a popular explanation of the decline of the Near East and the role of Islam, the evidence suggest that the climate change could have contributed significantly to the collapse of the Sasanian settlements before the arrival of Muslims.

Combining the evidences of fauna/flora remains, lithic assemblage, site structure and changes of environment, I attempt to explore the causes and the influence of such change. Based on the analysis, it is highly possible that the decrease of mobility is an adaptive response to the environment changes of early Holocene and is correlated with food resource intensification. In southern part of North China, the decrease of mobility and the transition towards the sedentary life stimulate the development of food production, while in northern part of North China such transition contributes to the establishment of intensified hunting-fishing-gathering economy. It reminds us that though as an important premise for  the origin of agriculture, the transition from mobile to sedentary life would not necessarily lead to the development of food production in North China but is also compatible with intensified hunting-gathering subsistence.",Symposium,NA,Chao_Zhao,2,7,2,Th-morning

The cemetery consists of several sections, which represent the different social groups. During the early Longshan period, some large tombs were arranged in an area according to their sex and status at first, and then the other large tombs were centrally distributed in another area. During the late Longshan period, a group of large tombs appeared in another district, and the largest one of them with very complex structure and abundant luxury goods was located in a special area alone, so that it looks like a king tomb.

This approach is crucial to understanding the sociopolitical evolution of community organization and status variability involved in the emergence of the communal cemetery. All of the evidence from the analyses suggests that the emergence of the communal cemetery appears to be tied to the dramatic changes in mortuary practices, economic systems, household organizations and settlement patterns during the latter half of the Late Jomon of central Hokkaido.

",Bronze Age,Use-Wear Analysis,Social and Political Organization,"Processed from turtle shells and bovid scapulae, oracle bones were massively exploited by the ruling house of the late Shang Dynasty for divination. As opposed to traditional scholarship that holds primary interest in inscriptions engraved on these bones, I consider late Shang divination in entirety as a technological process that proceeds from the preparation and delivery of bone material via tributary networks all the way to bones’ after-use discard into pits. By switching the attention to the least examined pre-divination and post-divination stages, I focus on the texts of marginal inscriptions, the data of the used turtle plastrons and the records of stratigraphy recovered from Pit YH127 and Pit H3 at Yinxu. I argue that since regional tribute payers, capital scribes and diviners were made bound by the tributary networks of oracle turtles, their major behavioral patterns that aimed to facilitate the provision of turtle shells for divination would have been “recorded” by the altered materiality of the shells at each step of change. To detect and reconstruct such behavioral patterns and the physicality of divination can deepen our understandings of the groups that attended the industry of oracle bones, and thus the nature of oracle bones as well.

",Other,Bioarchaeology/Skeletal Analysis,Pastoralism,"The late Neolithic to early Bronze Age period (ca. 2800 BC–1900 BC) in the Ordos Region, Northern China was a transitional period, that included the adoption of agro-pastoralism, as well as increasing sociopolitical complexity. Subsistence economies were shaped by a variety of strategies that included a mixed agro- pastoral system focused on millet cultivation and herding of caprines and cattle, with limited contributions from hunting and gathering of wild plants. Here in this study we report the carbon (d13C), nitrogen (d15N), and nitrogen amino acid isotope analyses results for the dietary reconstruction of agro-pastoralists at the Shimao site in Shaanxi Province, China. Bone collagen carbon and nitrogen isotopic results of humans and animals are used as proxies of diet and local environment, and the local food web, that may also indicate differences in herding and management practices between different domesticated species.  Results demonstrate that the majority of humans and domestic pigs were fed with substantial amounts of millets or their byproducts. The domestic herbivores, sheep and cattle, showed different dietary characteristics in that the former likely were foddered with C3 plants or grazed upon the local environment, while the latter species were fed with larger amounts of C4 products.

Charcoal kilns, used by the villagers for supplemental income, were also identified throughout many of the surrounding stream valleys. Ethnobotanical analysis in the environs of Anindo Village indicates intensive arboriculture, as well as the cultivation of non-arboreal plants.

",Bronze Age,Mortuary Analysis,Mortuary Archaeology,"This presentation argues that the decision of the locations of the so-called royal tombs of the Anyang Hsi-Pei-Kang cemetery involved various social-strategic concerns. Although badly robbed, the excavations of the tombs yielded rich grave good assemblages, allowing archaeologists to approach to various elements of the theocratic authority of the late Shang kings. The reconstruction of the formation process of the cemetery has been attempted in the hope that the tombs can be assigned to the kings whose reigns are recorded in Shiji and in Zhúshu Jìnián (the Bamboo annals).  Drawing upon an original novel reconstruction of the relative chronology of the tombs, we examined spatial relationships between them at each phase of the formation process of the cemetery, particularly in terms of which pre-existing tombs the mourners were ‘designed’ to see and in what way, and have analytically revealed some distinct patterns. By comparing the timings of the implementations of those strategies with the genealogical relationships between the kings that were recorded in Shi-ji, we have investigated and reconstructed the social-strategic implications of the selections of those strategies in relation to their historical-contextual backgrounds.

",Historic,Mortuary Analysis,Mortuary Archaeology,"One major shift in mortuary practices that happened over the Han dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE) China, from burying bronze/pottery vessels to burying miniaturized architectural models, was usually explained as a result of the contemporary ideology of “treating the dead as alive”, or as a reflection of the social-economic transformation. While these previous interpretations invariably presumed that artifacts were passive representations and projections of ideological/social conditions of their contemporary people, the current paper intends to show the active roles of artifacts by shifting the main question from “what did grave goods represent or reflect” to “how did they influence people and what were their effects”. To do this, the paper first demonstrates that the material context created by existing pottery vessel styles was crucial for the emergence of granary terracotta as the earliest type of miniaturized architectural model; then it discusses how the newly invented granary models, by evoking the cognitive concept of miniaturism through their concrete material forms, resulted in a new category of grave goods being made and popularized, and eventually transformed people’s tomb practices. Thus artifacts should be seen as actively participating in social processes, influencing how people interact with and understand their world.

However, the mechanisms that enabled societies in ancient China (both those bordering on and distant from the steppe) to participate in the Bronze Age Eurasian arena are still poorly understood. Based on the latest archaeological discoveries in China, this article focuses on the participation of four regions of ancient China: the Ejin River Transfer Zone (ERTZ); the western Hexi corridor; central Inner Mongolia; and the middle Yellow River valley. The article analyzes all significant innovations, materials, and technologies transmitted via the Eurasian network and adopted in ancient China, with an emphasis on metallurgy and the variations in the mechanism of its adoption across different societies during the Bronze Age.

The problem, in part, has to do with discrepancies between dates that come from the same sites. Some dates have been reported to be earlier when the samples came from human remains. These discrepancies have been attributed to the ‘reservoir effect’. In order to investigate this, we analyzed and dated both human and animal remains from three Xiongnu period 'ring' burials in northwestern Mongolia – the so-called periphery of the Xiongnu Empire. Given this region has many lakes and that isotopically “heavy” d13C-values have been detected in cases from other regions of Mongolia, it is possible that fishing played a more important role than previously thought in the subsistence economy of some Xiongnu period pastoralists. Accordingly, paleodietary reconstructions based on dental pathology and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyzes were also examined to evaluate how broad the dietary resources might have been and whether these individuals subsisted mainly on terrestrial animals or if fish made up an important enough source of food as to affect 14C dates.",Symposium,NA,Deborah_Parrish,2,7,2,Th-morning

",Bronze Age,Ceramic Analysis,Chronology,"After the passage of the Iranian Antiquities Law of 1930, the Gorgan Plain in northeastern Iran was seen as one of the most promising regions in the Old World for archaeological research. Despite decades of pioneering field and laboratory research, northeastern Iran still lacks a regionally integrated ceramic chronology for significant stretches of its archaeological history, particularly the 3rd millennium BCE. While individual sequences from important sites such as Tureng Tepe and Shah Tepe are well known, the precise nature of their relationships to each other and to other less-well known neighboring sites have remained unclear. This lacuna in our understanding of the culture history of the region presents a major obstacle to developing models of the social, political and economic history of the Gorgan. This paper, therefore, presents the results of research aimed at constructing a regionally integrated ceramic chronology for this region, in light of the potential anthropological significance of this dataset with respect to the emergence of regional community networks and the formation of archaic complex polities.

",Bronze Age,Other,Frontiers and Borderlands,"How frontiers and borders are conceptualized in archaeology is critically influenced by the approaches and perspectives in culture contact research. Absence of written documents from Bronze Age Central Asia severely limits the application of such theories. The nature of the Bronze Age civilization of Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) in Central Asia, and its dispersion to neighboring NE Iran has been a long-lasting question in study of Prehistoric Western Asia. This paper aims to examine the BMAC presence in NE Iran, using Tepe Hissar as a case study, to understand how BMAC interacted with local cultures in this region. The evidence for existence of BMAC in NE Iran and the nature and extent of BMAC’s dispersion out of Central Asia is revisited from the perspective of frontier and borderland studies. The goal of this paper is to identify different types of borderland processes that occured in NE Iran, where these two cultures came into contact. In order to hypothesize about this interaction sphere, I turn to borderland theories, specifically the “continuum of boundary dynamics” and “borderland matrix” models in order to conceptualize the material culture evidence for BMAC in Iran as markers of various borderland processes.

They are in size from 2 to 4 mm in diameter, 1to3 mm in height, and hole width is about 1 mm. The beads were examined by using SEM and XRD. XRD examines shown that the beads are prepared of enstatite, a Mg-bearing pyroxene, and cristobalite, a high-temperature polymorph of quartz, formed when quartz is heated at 900–1470 °C. Our primary results suggest that the beads were prepared by heating talc to a high heat. First a paste was made from milled talc, water and a binding material. The paste was then molded into elongated shape and heated at a high temperature. This firing process made the paste hardened and transformed the talc into enstatite and cristobalite.

Using these resources, we identified crania from five burial assemblages in Guam, Tinian, and Rota that appear to have been culturally modified. Since these Latte Period sites each contain an early Spanish Historical Period component, it is possible a cultural practice that unintentionally (e.g., cradle boarding) or intentionally caused cranial modification was introduced shortly after European contact in 1521. Alternatively, this may have been a long-standing Chamorro practice that has been largely overlooked in pre-Contact burial assemblages.

Thermal influences on marine shell are poorly understood across all disciplines, including archaeology. Burning or heating may not always show any visual signs and rather can only be identified through erroneous results when dating or chemical analyses have been undertaken. Recent studies have begun to explore changes in structural and chemical aspects between varying burning/heating methods and durations, however, these studies only focus on a few shell species from the Mediterranean and fail to factor in overall microstructural differences between shell species.
Therefore, to better understand the processes of burning/heating on shell in tropical sites of Australasia an experimental study was undertaken. Six tropical marine shell species with varying microstructures were chosen to undergo three methods of burning/heating. These samples were then examined under Dinolite, SEM as well as under-going XRD analysis. Results show distinct differences between the various microstructures, both visually and chemically.

The evaluation critiques the frequent correlation of complexity with hierarchy and centrality and does so through a geostatistical analysis. This investigation begins with the development of a proposed model of Palauan sociopolitical structure, derived through ethnographic descriptions contextualized with re-readings of contact-era narrative accounts. This proposed model provides a hypothesis which is tested in a geographic information system (GIS) through the geostatistical analysis of regional settlement patterns and the distribution of village sites across the landscape at multiple scales. Through modelling clustering and dispersion of village sites across the landscape, the evaluation of central places and authority in Palau suggests the presence of meaningful settlement patterns at both local and regional scales.

While documentary accounts of explorers, traders, and missionaries have long been used by Pacific historians to examine foreign trade in Hawaii’s early colonial period, archaeological sites from this period have rarely been identified. As a result, we know little about how foreign goods acquired through such exchanges were actually used and understood by local Hawaiian communities. A legacy collection of foreign objects from Nu‘alolo Kai, a deeply stratified residential site on Kaua‘i Island occupied through the mid-nineteenth century, offers a unique source of information on this topic. Protected deposits at the base of a cliff preserved a remarkable assemblage of imported materials in the site’s upper layers, which include copper, iron, glass, ceramics, cloth, and Bible pages printed in the Hawaiian language. While foreign goods at indigenous sites have often been taken as evidence for transformative change, more recent views highlight the ways that unfamiliar objects can be recontextualized in new settings.

Presented here is a continuation of this work, with new faunal analyses incorporated from recently excavated inland, western, and earlier (Saladoid) sites, as well as faunal data from a few past reports that were recently discovered. Currently, the data indicate differences between assemblages from the previously examined coastal Troumassoid sites and the recently included inland occupations. A difference was also identified between all Troumassoid sites and the earlier Saladoid settlements. Comparison of the faunal assemblages not only helps to enhance our understanding of Grenada’s prehistoric environments, but also the communities that interacted with them.

The loss of coastal land to erosion presents a serious obstacle to our understanding of the archaeological coastscape, due to the unpredictable rate in which it exposes and damages archaeological features. The exposure and subsequent disappearance of material culture is seldom accompanied by systematic archaeological recording. As a result, a wide range of past activities associated with the coast remain unrecorded, their context poorly understood and our understanding of past human interaction at local, regional and inter-regional scales impaired. Coastal erosion is, thus, both a predicament of cultural heritage preservation and an epistemological problem.

They provide insights into ancient subsistence and community practices. They also contain crucial information that can be used to create baselines for conservation. Their explanatory power is increased when the species exploited are identified. Here we describe an osteomorphological method which allows us to analyze fragmented postcranial elements of common Cheloniidae (Caretta Caretta and Chelonia mydas) to species and reconstruct species-specific exploitation patterns. We focus on two case studies from the Eastern Mediterranean (Turkey and Lebanon) which demonstrate that humans were selective in which sea turtle species they exploited. These multi-period case studies, in combination with published information about marine turtle exploitation in the region, also indicate long discontinuities in the archaeological record, which may be related to food avoidance. Size and sex reconstruction point at differing capturing techniques. Results have interesting implications for understanding human-marine turtle interactions with deep-time perspective.

This paper reconsiders the conceptual basis of intra- and inter-island relationships in the context of archaeology.  We argue that islands need not be isolated as geographic, ecologic or cultural entities and have not been so during the proto-historic and prehistoric periods.  Using 21st century equilibrium theory and gateway theory we suggest that islands may be in some contexts central places. We conclude that if one views the complex and dynamic interconnections of settler and indigenous identity through the lenses of locality, steady state sustainability, heterogeneity, gradualism, and interdependence, that a supply side analysis indicates that there are strong forces which influence the colonialism of islands towards vertical relationships of the trade dynamic if not the processes of production themselves.

Numerous species of whales have been observed in New England’s shallow waters, including migratory species like the North Atlantic Right Whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and other marine mammals like the Harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Wampanoag on Martha’s Vineyard and neighboring islands negotiated drift whale rights with the English, reserving claims to dead whales on sold lands, particularly along the southwestern coast. Stranded whales were also trapped and driven ashore at nearby coasts. 

In this paper, the role of drift whales and other beached finds is assessed at the Frisby Butler site, located along the southwestern shore of Martha’s Vineyard. Marine mammals account for less than 1% of the total assemblage but represent at least four separate species. How can we explain the diversity of these taxa at a site otherwise focused on deer and inshore fishing?

The data suggest that seabirds represented a significant resource in the Faroese subsistence economy from the earliest Norse settlement onward. Fowling thus represented one component of a broad-based subsistence regime that was aimed primarily at decreasing vulnerability to food shortfalls, particularly those caused by failures in the agro-pastoral economy.

AD 980-1450. A Norse society of perhaps only some 2500 farmer-hunters settled two subarctic niches: the Eastern Settlement in South Greenland with ca. 550 sites and the smaller Western Settlement 500 km north in the inner parts of the Nuuk fjord region and with only some 90 sites. For still not completely understood reasons, the latter was completely abandoned by AD 1350-1450, the former a generation or two later.
This presentation reports the preliminary findings of two coupled projects that attempt to recognize key drivers of Norse settlement change and deterioration: Winter is Coming Project (WiCP) and Comparative Island Ecodynamics in the North Atlantic Project (CIE). WiCP investigates agriculturally marginal areas to understand Norse settlement and land use dynamics in settings highly susceptible to climatic. CIE compares the ecodynamics of long-term societal development in Iceland/Greenland. However, rather than reveal new clues to Norse settlement decline in Greenland, the two projects have over the last 5 years demonstrated more examples of successful adaptation, complex settlement dynamics, and societal change in agriculturally marginal fjord areas that offered the Norse other opportunities.

Thirty-four rings were identified, including two previously undetectable at ground level without the use of shallow geophysics. To determine if undocumented rings could also be located using this method, the survey was then extended to an area along the South Carolina coast where shell rings were not previously documented, but which is situated a few kilometers from several known rings. In multiple LiDAR datasets, two faint ring-shaped anomalies were identified within the survey area. Fieldwork in May and July of 2017 confirmed that both anomalies represented low-relief Late Archaic shell rings. We conclude with preliminary data from the July fieldwork on the two rings, and contrast site maps produced using the LiDAR-derived data with those from ground-based topographical mapping, subsurface probing, and shovel testing.

",Other,Survey,"Ideology, Ontology, and Memory","This paper presents the results of an extended project directed at an archaeological investigation of religious conversion to Islam in South Asia. The project combined extensive regional survey, excavations and architectural documentation focused upon the site and valley of Indor, located in the region of Mewat on the borders of Rajasthan, North India.

The medieval residents of Mewat were stereotyped in contemporary imperial chronicles as primitive rebels, living in a forested hilly backwater, beyond the pale of civilized politics. After conversion to Islam in the fourteenth century CE, one group amongst them came to be known as the Khanzada lineage. The Khanzada founded Indor, a fortified city as monumental as any other in the region, and over the next five centuries, a salient attachment to place and a distinctive material repertoire were intrinsic to the Khanzada tradition.

This paper presents a contextualization of the site, its rapid emergence and the variable decline of its urbane capacities over 5 demonstrable phases of settlement in the Indor valley. Through analysis of the unprecedentedly rich assemblages of monumental sepulchral architecture and ornaments from Indor, it argues for the salience of the categories of tradition and virtue for the archaeology of religion.",Symposium,NA,Mudit_Trivedi,1.5,5,1.5,Th-morning

",Iron Age,Bioarchaeology/Skeletal Analysis,Subsistence and Foodways,"Three adjacent, chronologically overlapped, and metallurgically active sites in central Thailand were excavated by the Thailand Archaeometallurgy Project (TAP). This study focuses on dental pathology (caries, calculus, periapical abscessing, antemortem tooth loss, linear enamel hypoplasia) observed on human skeletal remains from Nil Kham Haeng (500 B.C.-A.D. 600) to investigate possible foodways and lifeways of its inhabitants. Among approximately 20 individuals represented, 16 have sufficient dental elements preserved for observation (252 teeth, 145 sockets). When the results are contextualized with another TAP site of Non Mak La and other contemporaneous sites in the region, Nil Kham Haeng shows high prevalence of dental calculus, moderate level of antemortem tooth loss, and negligible to no occurrence for all other indicators. This pattern is consistent with that observed across prehistoric Mainland Southeast Asia. This can be attributable to the consumption of rice and/or millet as staples and broad-spectrum diets. Combined with pending stable isotope analysis, a clearer picture of Nil Kham Haeng dietary pattern will contribute to the poorly understood human lifeways in prehistoric central Thailand.",Symposium,NA,Chin-hsin_Liu,1.5,5,1.5,Th-morning

",Bronze Age,Zooarchaeology,Political Economy,"Equid had a vital role in animal economy in Southwest Asia. Whether, as a wild animal providing primary/secondary to prehistoric communities, or a domestic source of energy, which supported war affairs and trade during historic periods. Reconstructing the dynamics of human and the four-equid species, which were present in the region, is quite complicated endeavor due to; the paucity of skeletal evidence in faunal assemblages; the difficulties in distinguishing morphological traits to separate between the closely related species and hybrids; the perplexing morphometric approaches to identify equid’s skeletal elements. Therefore, integrating archaeological and textual evidences from the historic periods in the Near East, provides an exceptional opportunity to assess the distribution of equids, and their role on an economic and cultural levels. This study aims to demonstrate the available evidence of equid exploitation strategies during the Bronze Age, using zooarchaeological analyses. While, enhancing our knowledge on how domestic and wild equid species were incorporated in the early urban entities, through the archaeological and textual representations of these animals. Compiling different lines of evidence is expected to illustrate how complex societies maintained their provisioning networks and maximized the intake of animal products within the early- Urban cities in southwest Asia.",Symposium,NA,Lubna_Omar,1.5,5,1.5,Th-morning

",Other,Iconography and Epigraphy,Water Management and Irrigation,"The IRAW@Bagan project is aimed at developing an integrated socio-ecological history for residential patterning, agricultural practices, and water management at the Medieval Burmese (Bama) capital of Bagan, Myanmar (11th to 14th century CE). As part of this long-term research program investigations have been initiated on the Tuyin-Thetso mountain range, located 11.25 km southeast of Bagan’s walled and moated epicenter. This upland area figures prominently in the chronicles of early Bagan, and numerous 13th century religious monuments were erected there. Recent explorations on Tuyin-Thetso have drawn attention to an additional feature of historical significance, a rock-cut tank located along the eastern edge of the Thetso-Taung ridge. Referred to by local villagers as Nat Yekan (Spirit Lake), this reservoir appears to have been integral not only to the initial collection and subsequent redistribution of water via a series of interconnected canals and reservoirs spread across the Bagan plain, but also, through its associated iconographic imagery, it may have been intended to purify this water, symbolically enhancing its fertility. This presentation will provide a preliminary assessment of Nat Yekan’s potential economic, political, religious, and ideological significance during Bagan’s classical era.",Symposium,NA,Gyles_Iannone,1.5,5,1.5,Th-morning
