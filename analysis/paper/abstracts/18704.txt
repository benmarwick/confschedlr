abstract
the british museum has in its collections an assemblage of 188 stone paleoindian projectile points and later archaic arrowheads that were purchased in 1962 from t.c. kelly a colonel in the usaf who was based for a time at raf mildenhall in the 1950s. i came aware of the collection and its potential importance whilst i was employed as curatorial assistant in the 1990s at the british museum quaternary outstation at franks house, and later when researching clovis paleoindian projectile points for my masters dissertation in 2008 to 2010. 
 the inventory in the british museum register for the kelly collection, shows there was some attempt to identify the points by the museum staff at the time, and after reading communications between col kelly and gale sieveking, who was assistant keeper of the department and worked on the palaeolithic collections at franks house at the time. but the descriptions were quite vague and some of the points were misidentified, and the collection remained unseen and studied for 40 years after its original registration.
