this study explores a recurrent problem in the archaeological field. how to start the analysis of archaeological material? specifically, how to analyze a ceramic sample stylistically? based on research carried out at the cerro de oro archaeological site on the south coast of peru, the author proposes a methodology that covers identifiable aspects in most data groups. the study of decorative techniques, the identification of iconographic designs and the observation of distribution patterns will provide us with relevant and necessary information when developing investigations related to archaeological materials, particularly those that focus on the decoration of vessels. the objective of this proposal is to be useful for those researchers who follow this line of work and who need a starting point or alternative ways of approaching their data.
