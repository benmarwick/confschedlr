modern day çorum is the homeland of the hatti people; the culture that later formed the hittite empire. resuloglu, dated to the early bronze age (ca. 2500–2100 bc), is one of the few hatti sites being systematically excavated. the site, located on a hilltop near the delice river, consists of a cemetery area and settlement that spreads over two opposing–once connected–ridges with numerous extraordinary metal and vitreous artifacts. the settlement exemplifies well the self-sustaining pre-hittite societies in the halys basin.
this research focuses on the early bronze age metal and vitreous artifacts at resuloglu to understand the production technologies by combining archaeometric methods with archaeological theories about integrated crafts. while comparing and contrasting the technology and raw material exploitation at resuloglu with the available local and regional data, we will also present the results of the new ongoing survey at the region. by using the archaeometric and survey results of resuloglu, we would like to bring a fresh look to theories of possible local production(s) region and trade relations of hatti before the hittite kingdom emerges.
