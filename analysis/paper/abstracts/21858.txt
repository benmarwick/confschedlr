historic literature frequently mentions the exploitation of sea turtles throughout the caribbean by indigenous populations and early settlers alike. large and abundant, these animals provided a readily accessible protein source for european and african populations as they traveled. a review of documents held by the belize archives and records service reveals that sea turtle capture and sale was once a large contributor to belize’s coastal economy. commonly called “turtlers”, 25% of the population was involved in the capture and sale of sea turtles by the late eighteenth century. offshore reconnaissance on st. george’s caye has led to the recovery of sea turtle remains associated with turtle corrals that were documented on a 1764 map. per results of faunal analysis from the island, the majority of animal remains recovered belong to at least two different species of sea turtle. turtle species varied in their preference by people as a food item, the method of capture, and their role in the economy. the distribution of the remains of these different turtle species across the island helps to provide insight into the relationship of the many inhabitants of st. george’s caye with the various aspects of turtling.
