the archaeology of the archaic period in northeastern north america is dominated by site-based research used as a springboard for discussing regional and pan-regional concepts and ideas. new results are often understood using paradigms created from these studies of singular origin. the present paper takes a different approach and discusses the author’s exploration of the broadspear lithic toolkit phenomenon across the northeast. the collections-based study in question updates known datasets of broadspear-context sites to reflect recent research, and takes advantage of these robust datasets using an outline-based geometric morphometric analysis to inform metric variation across the study region. this paper summarizes the results of this research program to date with an emphasis on learning networks and large-scale cultural dynamics in the late/terminal archaic period.
