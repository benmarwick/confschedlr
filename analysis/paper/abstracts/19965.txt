a significant change in residential pattern has been observed during the transition from paleolithic to neolithic of north china, indicating the decrease of mobility and the tendency towards the sedentary life. combining the evidences of fauna/flora remains, lithic assemblage, site structure and changes of environment, i attempt to explore the causes and the influence of such change. based on the analysis, it is highly possible that the decrease of mobility is an adaptive response to the environment changes of early holocene and is correlated with food resource intensification. in southern part of north china, the decrease of mobility and the transition towards the sedentary life stimulate the development of food production, while in northern part of north china such transition contributes to the establishment of intensified hunting-fishing-gathering economy. it reminds us that though as an important premise for  the origin of agriculture, the transition from mobile to sedentary life would not necessarily lead to the development of food production in north china but is also compatible with intensified hunting-gathering subsistence.
