we usually consider tokens as ‘alternative’ coins or gadgets that are used for different purposes. when you visit a museum, you can store your jacket or bag in the cloakroom and then receive a token to claim your item(s) back at the end of your visit. tokens were also commonly used in the roman world. archaeologists are still finding many tokens, also known as 'tesserae', but they often struggle to interpret and understand the tokens’ functions and roles within ancient communities.

luckily, the ‘token communities in the ancient mediterranean’ project is currently being undertaken by the university of warwick to understand the scope of ancient tokens. as a research fellow, i am currently analyzing hellenistic and roman tokens discovered in sicily and now kept in local museums. the scope of my paper is to provide a first-hand outline of this vital research. first, i present the whole project, assessing the archaeological evidence and describing a selection of roman 'tesserae'. then, i evaluate sicilian tokens, offering a detailed account of unpublished finds. such case studies are crucial for understanding the role of tokens within local communities, and reveal a wealth of information about economy, cults and religion on a regional scale.
