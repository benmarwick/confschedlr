during the late chalcolithic (c. 4500-3100 bce), the lowlands and highlands of southwest asia became increasingly entangled both economically and culturally. interaction during this time was organized through a network of colonial enclaves and diasporas. following the collapse of this exchange network, the region underwent dramatic changes leading to increased regionalization and ruralization. scholarly discourse posits that only after centuries of isolation and impoverishment there came a phase of renewed social complexity and interregional interaction during the second half of the third millennium bce. however, while distinct cultural zones following the late chalcolithic display only very little contact in material culture, limited evidence suggests continued interregional exchange structured along very differently principles.
based on new evidence from work at kani shaie in iraqi kurdistan, this paper argues that the distinct cultural zones between the tigris river and the highest reaches of the zagros chains maintained periodic interaction. this zagros interaction sphere facilitated social and economic ties across dispersed communities inhabiting different ecological zones. these highland-lowland interactions characterize an alternative development of social complexity resulting in the formation of indigenous polities and ethnic identities that are often characterized as peripheral and small-scale to wider developments in bronze age southwest asia.
