in the southeastern united states, as well as in north america more broadly, archaeological wood charcoal continues to be an underutilized data source. in this paper, i review previous north american studies and models of prehistoric fuelwood collection. i use these past studies to highlight how wood charcoal data might contribute new insights on the archaeological record. i also present findings from a recent analysis of wood charcoal from three sites in the north carolina piedmont. this new data is framed as a case study to demonstrate how such information can be put to use.
