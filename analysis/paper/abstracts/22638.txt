the fort ancient period (ad 1000-1700) saw the introduction of formal villages to the peoples of the middle ohio valley. to help understand the transition to full time sedentary villages, this paper explores how these new villages operated as communities. this allows for an examination of the relationship between communities and villages as concepts and as organizational units. this paper uses the guard village site (12d29), an early fort ancient village, as a case study to examine this new form of community organization. lines of evidence will be drawn from village architecture, such as site layout and construction techniques as well as the ceramic assemblage including production communities. these data will be used to attempt to identify the social processes, interactions, and mechanisms that were utilized to integrate larger populations into villages, and how people adapted to this new social unit.
