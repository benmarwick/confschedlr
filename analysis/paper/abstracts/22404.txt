timing of hopewellian developments plays a critical role in developing an understanding of how hopewell came to be, and what it was. focusing on the scioto hopewell sites studied by the scale and community in hopewell networks (schon), we present the results of 40 new radiocarbon dates obtained from 15 sites including both habitation and earthwork sites. we also undertake an evaluation of previous dates from these sites to come to a more robust understanding of the timing of key hopewellian events. previous models are based on cross-dating inference derived from assays that have never been previously subjected to quality assessment. we provide the first dates on many sites, and the most carefully selected suite of dates for all of the included sites. our results call into question some of the narratives advanced by previous investigators for the region, and for specific sites.
