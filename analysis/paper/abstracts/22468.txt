this paper describes the species diversity and taphonomic modifications of woodland period fauna from upper east tennessee. fauna from both rock shelter and open-air locales from the early woodland (ca. 3000 years b.p.) to the late woodland period (ca. 1000 years b.p.) are used to characterize subsistence practices and sites use in the region. in this paper, we present the mni, nisp and measures of diversity, richness and evenness of different animal species identified in the faunal assemblages of more than a dozen woodland period sites. we also use taphonomic modifications, such as burning, gnawing and digestion of bone, to discuss site formation processes. finally, several dog burials are described.
