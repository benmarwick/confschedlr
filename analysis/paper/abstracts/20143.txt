cross-culturally and through time, anthropologists have found that--within hierarchical societies--elites tend to manage resources and allocate risk primarily to their own benefit. there is little reason to believe that late roman imperial frontier elites would have behaved any differently. this paper examines the archaeological relationship between biological 'stress' or health--as inferred from skeletal remains--and socio-economic status / class--as evaluated on the basis of mortuary treatment--at the roman frontier city of viminacium, located on the danube river in modern day serbia. mortality estimates, paleopathology, skeletal lesions, and stature data are all applied in a conjunctive approach to complicated issues of health and socio-economic class under historically known conditions of intense status hierarchy.
