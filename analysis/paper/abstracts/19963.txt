this paper presents evidence from a new maritime archaic habitation site located on the island of newfoundland, canada. unlike the adjacent mainland of labrador, very few archaic habitation sites are known from the island, which makes this work critical to understanding archaic settlement and social organization across the broader region. excavations have produced hundreds of lithic artifacts and geomorphological data suggesting that a variety of subsistence and domestic activities occurred at the site. a suite of ams dates also indicates that the site was occupied during the pioneering phase of archaic settlement on the island and revisited for several centuries. in this paper, we discuss the artifact assemblage, spatial organization, and chronology of the archaic occupation of stock cove and situate it within the broader context of the colonization and settlement of far eastern north america.
