through the previous research on the royal ontario museum’s mould fragments, three main types of moulds were identified. in order to extend our knowledge beyond the moulds themselves and associate the moulds to the bronze vessels this paper brings both the moulds and bronze vessels into the same discussion by looking at the correlation between the mould types and the bronze vessel forms they were made to produce. the correlation can further our comprehension into the reason of produce the mould forms the way they were made.
