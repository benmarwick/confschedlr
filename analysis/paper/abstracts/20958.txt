intensive excavations and attendant analyses conducted at the old vero site (8ir009) from 2014-2017 have revealed a long and complex stratigraphic succession which dates from ca. 30,000 b.p. to the present. the excavations have documented not only 195 species of plants and animals but also a human presence which extends back to at least 11,000 b.p. and, perhaps, earlier. terminal pleistocene extinction dates are provided on several taxa as well as observations about the environments within which they lived. evidence of previously undocumented anthropogenic activities are also offered, including a very tentative late pleistocene tapir kill as well as later archaic utilization(s) of this venerable site.
