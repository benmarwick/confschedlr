the use and production of lithic tools offers an avenue into the behavior and activities conducted in ancient residential and ritual contexts. we explore variability in the lithic assemblages of various contexts in the ancient maya neighborhood of tutu uitz na in the late-terminal classic period (ad 700-900). tutu uitz na is one of several neighborhoods surrounding the lower dover political center in the belize river valley. variation in household lithic assemblages might vary based on the wealth and status of the occupants or specialized activities involving stone tools. this presentation comprises a synchronic comparative analysis of stone tools and debitage from an intermediate elite ceremonial and residential group, 4 commoner households of high and low status, a specialized lithic workshop and a ritual rockshelter associated with the intermediate elite group. the presentation will offer perspectives on the ways in which the study of lithics can illuminate the internal economic, agricultural, religious and political dynamics of a classic maya neighborhood, and the types of activities which people of varying statuses pursued.
