several of the most well documented and thoroughly excavated archaeological sites in the interior plateau of british columbia, exist in the anahim lake locality (fcsi-1, fcsi-2), and the tezli village site (fgsd-1) at kluskus lakes. artifacts from these assemblages were collected by roscoe wilmeth and paul donahue in the 1970’s, and are now housed at the canadian museum of history. given the presence of reliable carbon dating, and the high concentration of lithic artifacts in these collections, this paper will seek to elucidate the temporal distribution of fine-grained volcanic (fgv) tool stone material, such as dacite and obsidian, within these assemblages. utilizing portable x-ray florescence (pxrf) we examine the geochemical fingerprints of volcanic toolstone within these site assemblages, and offer a comparison of the temporal distribution of materials within each site, and between sites.
