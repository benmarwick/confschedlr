in this paper, i present a generalized morphological typology for all central coast peruvian ceramic vessels.  today, as in the past, similarly shaped (or in some cases identically shaped) vessel forms have been given different names by different authors, obfuscating another’s researcher’s ability to cross reference ceramic forms rapidly.  as publishable material becomes increasingly digitalized and online accessible, it is not hard to imagine a “patch” program that identifies differently named vessel forms and auto-renames the forms to such a generalized morphological typology.  the benefits are threefold: standardized typological names in all digital material, ability to access most relevant publications with ceramic vessels of interest, and rapid single word search parameters.
