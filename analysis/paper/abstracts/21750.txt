the winnemucca lake basin, one of many branches of pleistocene lake lahontan in northwest nevada, is again in the headline news for early human occupation of the great basin.  possible horse butchering at the end of the pleistocene, fuel storage, grasshopper caching (14,195 cal. bp) and ancient rock art add to the intrigue of an ever developing mystery behind north americas earliest ancestry.  most familiar are fishbone and crypt caves, a part of the guano mountain cave complex, where a reevaluation of storage facilities has added a new dimension to the great antiquity of the lahontan basin.  a synthesis of the evidence found throughout the winnemucca lake basin is the purpose of this presentation; an analysis of that evidence is the goal.
