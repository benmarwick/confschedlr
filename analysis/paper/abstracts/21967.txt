this paper aims to discuss how the success of community partnership has led to an understanding of the way people moved across the landscape in the past. situated in northern new mexico, the pueblo de abiquiú contains a rich history that dates back at least into 2,800 – 4,000 bp (before present). using portable x-ray fluorescence spectrometry, obsidian artifacts found at the pueblo suggests that groups are bringing obsidian from at least three known local sources.  however, there is an unidentified source within the artifacts collected.  community partner, bernardo archuleta, is helpful and knowledgeable about the many trails and access points of the abiquiú landscape.  this reinforces a stronger interpretation of the procurement and exchange routes between the material sources and the pueblo de abiquiú.
