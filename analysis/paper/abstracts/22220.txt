the american midwest served as a place for the exchange of materials and culture, and as the political center of north america by ad 800. the rise of the mississippian polity of cahokia altered the religious, political, and social structures of long-established midwestern cultural groups in contact with cahokia, including the populations of the oneota and langford tradition settled along the mississippi river and its tributaries. while mississippian period (ad 900–ad 1500) artifacts have been found in langford tradition contexts, there exist conflicting views on the range and depth of cahokian influence on these populations. a study of faunal remains associated with the langford tradition keeshin farm site in rockford, illinois, and comparison of results from similar sites reveal changes in subsistence as a reaction to influence from both cahokian and oneota sources. analysis of the keeshin farm faunal assemblage includes measuring dental wear patterns, determining seasonality for hunting, and identifying processing techniques for cervus canadensis (wapiti), odocoileus virginianus (whitetail deer), and other mammals commonly used for food. keeshin farm results are then compared to those at hotel plaza, gentleman farm, and zimmerman sites in illinois to provide further insight into continuity and change in langford tradition subsistence.
