this paper applies the chaîne opératoire analytical framework to hearth maintenance behavior. there are distinct phases of production involved in creating and maintaining a hearth, as new hearthstones are introduced, exhausted, and discarded. these stages may be identified through spatial distribution of new and exhausted hearthstones. the authors argue that these stages may also be identified geochemically. we use pxrf to compare a series of experimental burnings to those from a hearth feature from the late woodland component of a multicomponent rockshelter. group membership analysis had some success in distinguishing between stages of burning. when combined with spatial analysis, the distribution of new and exhausted rocks supported our hypothesis that the northern periphery of the hearth was disturbed by a previous excavation and distributed in its backdirt atop the original hearth feature.
