the discovery of a nearly complete, articulated bison occidentalis in association with a calf creek projectile point in the northern texas panhandle in 2002 constitutes one of the few known middle archaic archaeological sites in the region. as the remains were found incidental to the construction of a new municipal swimming pool, documentation of the excavation and any subsequent analysis were less than ideal. a recently obtained ams radiocarbon date of the remains at 5115 rcybp falls within the established time range for the calf creek horizon. this paper reports on the results of new faunal, lithic sourcing, and paleobotanical analyses conducted on materials from this site. it focuses on the context of the discovery of the stinnett bison site, the material culture, and the implications for past human activity in the area. as the only middle archaic site excavated in the texas panhandle to date, it offers insights into the nature and timing of occupation during the late altithermal period. the results of the present study both conform to what has been established about the calf creek horizon elsewhere and expand our understanding of it.
