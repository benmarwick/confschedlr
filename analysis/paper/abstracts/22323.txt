with the growing availability of high-resolution aerial imagery, capabilities for spatial and land use analyses also become more of a possibility to researchers. drones are becoming more affordable with sensors capable of capturing imagery at sub-meter resolutions. ground cover classification allows further investigation into land use, disturbance and site integrity. this paper discusses the use of supervised and object based classification methods using image analysis software and high-resolution imagery obtained from unmanned aerial systems. it also discusses the use of multispectral imagery in drone-based survey applications and capabilities for classification based on varying image resolutions. best practices for maintaining resolution and image integrity are discussed along with processing capabilities based on project goals. a training area located near peru’s north coast is used to create classification parameters, which is then tested against similar areas on the north coast. utilizing this method, we are able to classify land use, disturbances, and cultural sites with some limitations.
