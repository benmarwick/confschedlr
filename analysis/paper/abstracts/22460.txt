in the descriptions supplied by columbus, the aboriginal groups of the caribe applied different techniques to modify their cranial morphology. the type of artificial skull deformation used by the pre-columbian population that inhabited cuba was the oblique-tabular frontal-occipital, representative of the arawak–taino communities. this practice disappeared in the early years of spanish colonization. here we present a three-dimensional reconstruction of five specimens from the university of havana. for the first time, a three-dimensional reconstruction of these fossils has been created. in order to compute the 3d model, we used close range structure-from-motion photogrammetry technique. taking into account the limitations of the sample size, this is a preliminary study to identify the main deformations over the skull surface and to analyze the implications of cranial deformations in the structure of the craniovascular vessels. our results show that cranial vasculature is developmentally plastic and responds to deformation in a predictable pattern. head-shaping practices correlate both biological growth and cultural features. in the future, more specimens are required to understand the real complexity of the processes associated with artificial cranial deformations and their expressions in the bone and vascular substrate
