I use data from the site of Calixtlahuaca to evaluate the archaeological validity of such stereotypical practices for one group, the Matlatzinca. In particular, I focus on the heavy reliance on maguey, and locally distinctive foodways relating to maize. I then consider whether these practices became more or less pronounced once the area came under Triple Alliance rule. I find that there is a modest shift toward more characteristically Aztec practices in both activities over time, but that these changes are highly unevenly distributed among households. Given that both of the activities under consideration are relatively low-visibility, household-level practices, it is unlikely that they were specifically targeted by Aztec imperial policies. This suggests that shifts toward more Aztec practices were largely voluntary actions by particular subgroups of the local population.",3036,"Symposium","Presenter","Angela_Huster",3.5,13,3.5,"Sa-morning",14

My own research on the Aventura ceramics, begun in 2015 as part of the Aventura Archaeology Project, supports Joe Ball’s early observations on Classic Period ceramics in Northern Belize. Furthermore, his important definitions of ceramic spheres and systems provide an excellent way to frame Aventura’s long chronology and inter-regional connections through time. While still in its preliminary stages, I am hopeful that continuing work on the ceramics of Aventura will go beyond establishing a site and regional chronology, and highlighting inter-site connections, to telling us something more about “ancient Maya economic systems, political history, ceremonial behavior, ideology, societal structure, and community organization.” (Ball 1993)

Of the 19,149 bones examined from a 2016 excavation, all were identified to at least an animal’s taxonomic order, although identification to the species level was usually not possible due to the fragmentary nature of the sample. This information was compared with radiocarbon data to determine changes to diet through time as well as with oral histories from Seminole community members in order to compare stated dietary preferences with prehistoric evidence. The study determined that the three most prominent animal types present are turtle, fish, and snake, and that there were fluctuations in animal composition present throughout time which may indicate a changing environment and differential resource availability and exploitation.  There is strong evidence that climatic changes, specifically the Little Ice Age, had an impact on the diets tree island inhabitants.  Understanding the environmental changes through time and their impacts on subsistence patterns indicate the ways in which tree island inhabitants reacted to these environmental changes.",3094,"Electronic Symposium","Presenter","Brandy_Norton",1.25,4,1.25,"Sa-morning",5

These conditions have provided valuable, but varied resources for local populations throughout human occupation. Sites identified during summer 2015 and 2016 illustrate the preservation of sites in environments where both submersion and drying have occurred. Investigations during summer 2017 revealed the presence of numerous landforms under the modern lake. Sub-Bottom survey showed preserved features including shorelines, buried channels, and possible rivulets. Underwater test excavations on these features demonstrated their preservation under more than 2 meters of sediment. Marker horizons and preserved organics provide valuable guides for future research such as depositional chronology, potential for preserved perishable materials, and ideal locations for extensive excavations.

","Other","Other","Caves and Rockshelters","Archaeological research in mainland Southeast Asia is a relatively recent endeavor, but as the region’s culture history has become more fully known, a gap in evidence called the “missing millennia” has emerged. The gap falls during the middle Holocene c. 6000-4000 BP when few sites have dated deposits. Yet from evidence dating before and after those millennia, important changes must have occurred, including changes in settlement systems, lithics and ceramic technologies, the appearance of cereal agriculture, and new burial practices. Recent palaeoclimate research under the auspices of the Middle Mekong Archaeological Project in northern Laos is providing possible clues related to the gap in archaeological evidence. Four new speleothem records document an abrupt trend of weakened monsoons beginning at approximately 5-4.5- ka initiating the onset of a mega-drought that peaked at approximately. 4.0 ka. The drought climax near the “4.2 ka event” is when other parts of Eurasia and Africa experienced sharp climate shifts and associated human dislocations and societal adjustments. This paper reviews the emerging evidence and proposes an initial interpretation of societal responses to this significant period of climate change",3102,"Symposium","Presenter","Joyce_White",1.5,5,1.5,"Sa-morning",6

Excavations by Dickens (1976), Keel (1976), and Moore (1981; 2002) better defined changes over time in Pisgah ceramics while simultaneously showing the variation in Pisgah-associated features, households and settlements. This paper will examine Pisgah ceramics from two sites, Cane River in western North Carolina and Carter Robinson in southwestern Virginia, using an attribute analysis approach and taking into account the artifact, features, and household contexts in which these sherds are found.

As one of the most iconic equestrian cultures of the eighteenth century, the Comanche have been a common subject of these anthropological and historical investigations. Recent studies of the Comanche have focused on the role of horses in facilitating their rise from small-scale hunter-gatherers into major economic and political players. Although the impact of horse on Comanche culture was certainly profound, emphasizing the functional effects of horses glosses over other important elements of the human-animal relationship. Indigenous approaches to human-animal relations offer one alternative interpretive lens to these traditional lines of inquiry. Indigenous philosophy is holistic and places humans and animals on the same behavioral continuum, merging the distinction between nature and culture, the functional and the social. This paper draws on indigenous philosophy to interpret a growing body of Comanche rock art in the Northern Rio Grande region. Through a discussion of this material archive, I explore the social life of horses within Comanche culture and the material manifestations of this relationship.",3106,"Symposium","Presenter","Lindsay_Montgomery",4,14,4,"Sa-morning",12

In addition, the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) requires all federal agencies to maintain inventories of their historic properties.  For decades, the NPS has relied upon three inventory systems: The List of Classified Structures, the Cultural Landscapes Inventory (CLI), and the Archeological Sites Management Information System (ASMIS). These systems began decades ago as paper files and continue today as electronic databases accessed via the internet.
  The inventories allow NPS to maintain and update critical information including resource type, location, condition, threats, and disturbances.  As the relevant technologies continue to develop with what seems like increasing rapidity, even these relatively modern databases are being rapidly rendered obsolete.  The NPS Cultural Resources, Science, and Partnerships directorate has begun work to modernize these systems, and to facilitate their further integration with GIS technologies and other NPS programs, and incorporate elements of the now defunct Ethnographic Resources Inventory (ERI).
