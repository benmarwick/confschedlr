central brazil includes archaeological sites dating from the pleistocene/holocene transition, mainly rock shelters and more rarely open-air sites. however these are important for understanding patterns of subsistence and settlement of populations. in mato grosso, research on the left bank of the southern course of rio vermelho has revealed a complex of occupations, in shelter and open-air, pre-ceramic and ceramic, dated since the middle holocene. on the opposite side of the river, in a conspicuous sandstone hill, morro solteiro exhibits shelters of rock art. although morro solteiro i (ms1) and the contiguous open air site, aldeia morro solteiro (ams), have rich ceramics occupations, dated to around 1000 years bp, pre-ceramic occupations only have been recognized in ams and dated from 6000 years bp. homogeneous data obtained in ams and ms1 indicate that this site was occupied successively by groups, at first hunter-gatherers then horticulturalists, from the beginning of the holocene. similarities between ceramics and lithic industries from ms1 and ams suggest that it could be a unique archaeological ensemble in litho-ceramic horizons. this type of association shelter/open-air site is rare in this rio vermelho region, which makes the morro solteiro complex an exceptional site and probably an important center of occupation.
