The architectural landscape consisted of the placement of the double-pen dwellings in two rows of three, separated by an open activity area with open-air structures at either end. The architectural style was consistent with late antebellum efforts to improve slave health and productivity by providing better housing such as wood floors and sturdier dwellings. At the same time, settlement configuration and location were consistent with increased perceived need for control of the slave population amid more frequent news of slave runaways and rebellions.

By 1745, German potters began to fill local needs for ceramics, a trade which grew in importance over the next century and a half. These vessels took on more than just utilitarian roles, as choosing to purchase locally made ceramics over imported wares allowed Valley residents to perform various ethnic, regional, and racial identities. As a result, researchers portray these pots as inherently White things, made by Germans for Germans (and their Scots-Irish neighbors). This does not hold up, however, when we add Black Virginians into the picture. From free Black potters and enslaved peoples who labored for White potters to enslaved consumers who bought local vessels for themselves, Black Virginians in the Valley regularly interacted with these ceramics.

The research discussed here addresses the lifeways of enslaved individuals on the Dutch Caribbean islands of St Eustatius, St Maarten and Cura√ßao.

",Historic,Other,Historical Archaeology,"In 1803, Denmark and Norway abolished the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which took effect on 1st January 1803. However, this did not end slavery itself in Africa. Intensification of cash-crop agriculture on the West African coast by the Danish colonists provoked an upsurge in the local slave trade. As the Danish plantation economy solidified, increasing numbers of enslaved people were engaged to labour in these plantations in Ghana. The research examines the documentary and the archaeological data of one of the earliest Danish plantations (Frederikssted plantation) established in 1794 in Dodowa, in Ghana. 
Frederikssted and other Danish plantations are part of the building blocks of long-term cultural contact spanning almost two centuries (1658-1850) between Denmark and Ghana, and they offer this research the opportunity to gauge the   continuities and discontinuities in contemporary. The excavations and the resultant material culture reveal that Frederikssted plantation site represents different episodes of occupation, abandonment, and reoccupation. Indigenous local elites who reoccupied the plantation (after its collapse in 1802) have play a crucial role in shaping the plantation landscape, which provides a new way to understand plantation archaeology in general.

",Other,Other,Cultural Heritage and Preservation,"Background: The 3-year Active Ageing and Heritage in Adult Learning project (2014-17, EU Erasmus+ program) involved five open-air museums in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, UK, and Hungary. Sessions were conducted in venues matching the era of clearest memories for participating older persons with dementia (PwD), e.g., 1940-ties apartment.  University researchers (Sweden, UK, & Denmark) evaluated the project. This presentation describes qualitative results.
The objective was to investigate if/how experiences of participating in reminiscence sessions held in open-air museum venues affected wellbeing in PwD. 
Method: PwD (n 129) were interviewed individually or in groups. Third-person perspectives were gathered from carers accompanying PwD (n 75), and session facilitators (n 24) using questionnaires that included space for free-text responses. Interviews and free-text responses were analyzed with content analysis. 
Results: Both museum venue and object handling stimulated PwD reminiscence. 
Evidence strongly indicates that PwD wellbeing (denoted e.g., by showing pleasure, humour, creative self-expression, interest, sustained attention, and a sense of connection with others) was generally promoted through participation in museum-based reminiscence sessions.
Conclusion: Museum-based reminiscence sessions were successful for enhancing PwD well-being at the time of the session. Further research is needed to explore and compare long-range effects of sessions.

Cultural appropriation or adoptation of orphan cultural identity?,South America: Andes,Other,Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology,Identity/Ethnicity,"In January 2017, members of the indigenous Salasaca community of the central sierra region of Ecuador discovered a cache of pre-Colombian pottery during ditch construction work which passed through a site of ritual significance. The government organisation responsible for managing antiquities removed the artefacts, promising that archaeological investigations would be carried out in due course. They never were.

The cache of artefacts was a strange mixture of authentic ceramic figurines and vessels of a wide geographical provenience, none of which were from the Salasaca area.  In the absence of formal excavations, it is unclear how they were deposited there in the first place. 

The local community responded enthusiastically, seeing the artefacts as an important connection with their lost ancestral past. Some believed they were mitmakuna ‚Äì peoples translocated by Inca conquerors in the 15th century from an alternative geographic location to replace rebellious tribes recently conquered. They had some oral traditions, but no ancestral connection with the land they had been brought to, suggesting this cache of artefacts filled a lacuna in their sense of cultural identity.  

This paper discusses the importance of archaeology and material cultural in the construction of collective cultural identity and ancestral legitimacy.

",Other,Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology,Cultural Heritage and Preservation,"Official discourses of what is considered cultural heritage affect the preservation and management of archaeological sites, as well as how people perceive and understand their cultural heritage. Consequently, the manner in which sites are managed impacts the degree of participation that people can have in their preservation, an activity that may serve in shaping local identities. The archaeological site of Los Indios in Santa Isabel, Puerto Rico, is an undervalued archaeological resource whose resident community cares for its preservation. However, they feel that it is hardly possible due to the lack of the government‚Äôs interest, which has led many times to the destruction of sites. On the other hand, the regard of the historical site of Old San Juan as cultural heritage is rarely questioned given that residents have to follow rigorous rules imposed by the local and federal government for the preservation of the historical architecture. In this presentation, I explore the impact that cultural heritage discourses have had in the preservation of Puerto Rico‚Äôs archaeological resources, through the comparison and analysis of: cases of archaeological scandals in the Puerto Rican media, and cultural heritage discourses of government institutions, archaeologists and residents of Santa Isabel and Old San Juan.",Symposium,NA,Natalie_De La Torre Salas,2.75,10,2.75,Th-afternoon

The local landscape is transforming as towering apartment complexes are quickly expanding into areas previously occupied by sprawling fields of crops. As documented ethnographically, these processes have heightened local awareness of the decline of community heritage values, like neighborliness, agricultural livelihoods, and green space. Furthermore, a diachronic ground survey has confirmed these dramatic changes in the previously small village over the last 5 years. Ahead of recent urbanization, industrialization of the area has expanded greatly in the last 20 years, especially in the designated industrial zone that surrounds the archaeological site. Indeed, ethnographic data indicates that factory construction in this zone has previously destroyed archaeological finds in its path.

However, at least 60 years ago most families that coalesced into this village were distributed in relation to smaller reliable water sources near the current community location. Field research located the known water sources and their uses. These solution cavities in the limestone bedrock range from large and deep sources that contain water year-round fed by vadose water flow to small and ephemeral pockets that are seasonally filled by rainfall. All of the identified water sources (sartenejas, aguadas, and cenotes) are maintained and still used at least periodically for apiaries, incidental agricultural use, laundry washing, drinking water sources for groups working away from the village, and as locations to check for game during hunting trips.

However, excavation is not always the most practical solution due to high project costs, lack of research potential, or stakeholders like tribal communities not wanting excavation. A case study from Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is used here to demonstrate how alternative forms of mitigation advance the research value of the cultural resources selected for study, grow public awareness and discourse through outreach and education, and increase flexibility in land-use decisions by agencies while satisfying the mutual interests of stakeholders. Ancestral Puebloan fieldhouses (A.D. 1200-1600) were impacted at LANL, and rather than excavating additional fieldhouses for mitigation, a synthesis of fieldhouse data from the region was requested. The project resulted in the acquisition of new and meaningful research that advances northern New Mexico and helps LANL archaeologists determine eligibility recommendations. Also, funds went towards the creation of a free public book to achieve wider public awareness about the local archaeology and significance of cultural preservation.

The government has gone to great lengths to rebuild and preserve many ancient indigenous sites and objects for use as national symbols and as a draw for tourism. However, this practice has contributed to the ‚Äòothering‚Äô of indigenous groups by placing the ‚Äòmysterious Indians‚Äô firmly in the past, and restricting the access of descendant communities. 

Working within a modern Maya community, the members of the Tihosuco Heritage Preservation and Development project seek to add to the national discourse on patrimony by using a tool recognized by the nation state: archaeology. The project investigates the legacy of the Caste War of Yucatan (1847-1901), one of the most successful indigenous rebellions in the New World.

This paper explores the ways in which archaeologists can navigate between the constructed national narrative and producing knowledge that may subvert or run counter to it. How do we negotiate the tensions that occur between the communities and government agencies that both provide approval for our work? How do government control and conceptions of ownership impact archaeological work? What impact do national laws protecting patrimony have on those living within historic sites?

Analysis of oral histories and archival records pertaining to archaeological practice in Montana (1935-1990) reveals how national ideals concerning race and class shaped the construction of heritage preservation laws. These ideals were entangled with the growing divide between professional and amateur sciences, and the establishment of modern land resource agencies, all of which fomented an antagonistic relationship among northern plains Tribes, dealers, amateur collectors, and Eastern professionals. The resulting heritage legislation provided professional archaeologists and federal land managers with near-exclusive (legal) authority over archaeology on public lands, a fact that has created long-standing frustrations among Tribal authorities and local amateurs, who believe their contributions were marginalized and de-legitimized. These tensions persist today in Montana and other Western states, and have contributed to the polarization of professional, public, and Tribal interests‚Äîan ongoing conflict that undermines national goals of heritage preservation within the rural American West, while confusing the public about the value and relevance of archaeological research.",Symposium,NA,Nancy_Mahoney,3.75,14,3.75,Th-afternoon

Instead of just thinking of field schools as a means to teach skills necessary for future employment, archaeology instructors should engage with critical pedagogies that help us better translate the utility of field schools in an era of financial shortfalls and Responsibility Centered Management budget models in higher education.

These projects are situated in the rich tradition of counter-mapping, which juxtaposes maps created by or to showcase the perspectives of non-hegemonic actors with authorized ‚Äòofficial‚Äô maps.  In creating these maps, students gain experience in conducting primary and secondary research, writing for public dissemination, and gain mastery of the histories beneath their feet.",Symposium,NA,Kim_Christensen,3.75,14,3.75,Th-afternoon

Together, we visited museums, monuments, archaeological sites, and other ancestral locations in Arizona, Arkansas, Washington D.C., and New York.  Through shared travel and discussions we experienced diverse places where Native American and Euro-American expressions of heritage are created. We considered the nature of concepts like ancestor and native in different contexts, and discovered new insights. At the same time, we discovered challenges and some solutions to practical problems facing collaboration. Disparities in training, funding, and expected benefits influenced decisions and outcomes.

Abstract
The British Museum has in its collections an assemblage of 188 stone Paleoindian projectile points and Later Archaic arrowheads that were purchased in 1962 from T.C. Kelly a Colonel in the USAF who was based for a time at RAF Mildenhall in the 1950s. I came aware of the collection and its potential importance whilst I was employed as Curatorial Assistant in the 1990s at the British Museum Quaternary outstation at Franks House, and later when researching Clovis Paleoindian projectile points for my Masters dissertation in 2008 to 2010. 
 The inventory in the British Museum register for the Kelly collection, shows there was some attempt to identify the points by the museum staff at the time, and after reading communications between Col Kelly and Gale Sieveking, who was Assistant Keeper of the Department and worked on the Palaeolithic collections at Franks House at the time.

",Other,Conservation and Curation,"Museums, Collections, and Repatriation","There are thousands of Japanese archaeological artifacts stored in the major arts and archaeology museums of the United States. Many of the collections came to this country during the late 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries. In those days, archaeological objects left their home countries more readily than today and reached at the foreign museums through expeditions, inter-institutional exchanges, purchases from private art galleries, and gifts from wealthy art collectors. Unfortunately, only a portion of these objects are currently on display in these museums, due primarily to the lack of proper investigation on these artifacts. I have been collaboratively working on a compilation of a catalogue of these artifacts for publication. Not only will it shed important light on the movement of such valued artifacts from Japan to the United States during the past 150 years; but it will also make the collections available for research and education across this country. A Japanese archaeological collection in the Penn Museum that was displayed at the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago exemplifies the movement of such collections to this country. A proper investigation will make this collection a valuable asset for research within this country.

Riddled as this moment in the market is with stories of looting, forgery and deceit, the period between roughly 1950 and 1990 is also the era in which significant parts of today‚Äôs best-known museum collections of pre-Columbian art were formed. Because of the practices of art dealers many pieces that once formed part of the same original deposit are now scattered over the globe. Any possible information on the  provenience of these clusters of objects can only be found hidden away in the archives of the institutions that hold them. The only way to bring these pieces back together and (partially) reconxtextualize them is through the study and publication of their object biographies. 
In this presentation I attempt to reassemble a corpus of Post-Classic Mesoamerican turquoise pieces, that were probably looted in the late 1950s/early 1960s and appeared on the market between 1950 and 1980. All of these are said to come from caves near Tehuac√°n, but lack any further information on their exact provenience and provenance. Nonetheless, the pieces can be relatively securely traced to specific localities or regions through a combination of stylistic, archaeological and archival research.

In particular, the analysis of bone that has undergone diagenesis can be frustrating because the process of humification may potentially introduce contaminant organic carbon.  Diagenesis occurs during burial and results from a combination of two distinct processes: (1) reactions involving indigenous organic carbon, (2) the complexation of collagen with soil humic substances. The radiocarbon measurement of altered bone, then, affects the age of the bone and reflects the presence of the exogenous humic carbon. Because the influence of contamination on radiocarbon measurements is dependent on the age of the sample, removal of humic carbon, particularly for older samples, is a necessity for accurate measurement. Pretreatment methods, such as XAD treatment and single-amino acid radiocarbon dating, have been applied to eliminate contaminant carbon and provide a purified sample for dating. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of XAD for the removal of humics using a controlled study and present suggested modifications to the procedure.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is assumed to be the only carbon source for photosynthesis. However, dating modern and historic reference fish and modern reference wild rice indicates the presence of ancient carbon in bones and plant material. Dating four historic reference fish obtained from the Mississippi River in 1939 in southeastern Minnesota yielded four distinctly different dates that do not overlap. Instead, they span 1223 to 307 BP, leading to the conclusion that dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and perhaps other ancient carbon contributes to a freshwater reservoir affect. Trophic level of the fish (and their diet) is implicated in this date range since they were caught in the same river, probably during the same fishing expedition. Adding additional reference fish, including northern pike, caught elsewhere in the state returned differential offsets implicating geology and DIC as sources of ancient carbon. Wild rice harvested in 2015 yielded similar age offsets to the highest trophic level fish, suggesting both high tropic level fish and wild rice take in carbon from both the freshwater reservoir and the atmosphere.

Radiocarbon sample size can be reduced toward the minimum of the 40-100 millionths of a gram of carbon that is actually needed for standard AMS dating. This allows the dating of remarkably small samples, and it results in the imperceptible removal of carbon from more traditionally-sized samples, such as a charred maize kernel (the botanist will never know a dating sample has been removed). A surface-active technique, plasma oxidation preferentially samples carbon molecules from object exteriors, allowing repeated stratigraphic sampling through accumulations such as soot on fragments of cave or rockshelter ceilings and the interpretation of sequential dates. Masking techniques can focus sampling on only portions of artifacts, and other innovative applications include the dating of organic pottery pigments, residues on artifacts, and organic binders in mineral pigments.

Conceptually, the framework is useful because it addresses in a statistically principled way two vexing sources of equifinality in archaeological data: (1) the radiocarbon calibration curve and (2) the fact that even if demographic rates such as age-specific mortality, fertility, and migration are stable an infinite set of demographic histories can yield the same predicted growth rate and stable age distribution. Fortunately, not all demographic histories are equally likely and some are even impossible. I utilize theoretical and empirical knowledge from evolutionary demography and life history theory to parameterize and specify prior probabilities for alternative demographic histories.

Some cultural components and sedimentary units remain undated. Discrepancies in the chronological record of Hell Gap may be better understood by improving the dating resolution using techniques not reliant on charcoal or cultural material such as that provided by OSL Dating.

However, the performance of archaeomagnetic dating has not lived up to its potential as a source of reliable dating information, frustrating client archaeologists. This is in part due to the common use of an outdated statistical approach to deriving date ranges from the SWCV1995 dating curve. Despite curve refinements (i.e., SWCV2000), reliance on the old calibration and the statistical approach have often produced nonsensical date results. We address these issues through the use of a graphical approach to confirm the sensibility of dates and date ranges, and the use of alternative dating curves for some time periods.

Here we present the innovative use of proteomics to investigate AAD from pig bones of different biological ages collected from an experimental forensic scenario. Furthermore, we explored the proteome variability of bones extracted from pigs that have been buried for different PMIs, to better understand the leaching phenomena associated with taphonomic events as well as the decay of proteins post-mortem. Our results showed relationships between the abundance of particular serum proteins with AAD, and glutamine deamidation with PMI, revealing the suitability of proteomics to forensic contexts.

The type of artificial skull deformation used by the pre-Columbian population that inhabited Cuba was the oblique-tabular frontal-occipital, representative of the Arawak‚ÄìTaino communities. This practice disappeared in the early years of Spanish colonization. Here we present a three-dimensional reconstruction of five specimens from the University of Havana. For the first time, a three-dimensional reconstruction of these fossils has been created. In order to compute the 3D model, we used close range Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry technique. Taking into account the limitations of the sample size, this is a preliminary study to identify the main deformations over the skull surface and to analyze the implications of cranial deformations in the structure of the craniovascular vessels. Our results show that cranial vasculature is developmentally plastic and responds to deformation in a predictable pattern. Head-shaping practices correlate both biological growth and cultural features. In the future, more specimens are required to understand the real complexity of the processes associated with artificial cranial deformations and their expressions in the bone and vascular substrate

These concurrent influences on human d2H-collagen values were examined in 11 North American archaeological sites.  The d2H-collagen values were compared to bone hydroxyapatite oxygen isotopes (i.e. d18O-HAP) and bone collagen nitrogen isotopes (i.e. d15N-collagen), which are proxies for meteoric water influence and amount of consumed protein, respectively.  Pooled site data yield moderate correlation between d2H-collagen and d18O-HAP and moderate correlation between d2H-collagen and d15N-collagen.  Conversion of d2H-collagen and d18O-HAP to meteoric water values yielded a similarly moderate correlation with a d2H/d18O slope below 8, the expected value observed in meteoric water.  Conversion to theoretical hydrogen isotope values free of trophic level influences resulted in a weak correlation with d15N-collagen, suggesting that direct trophic level enrichment/depletion is not controlling the disparity between expected and measured values.  The deviations are hypothetically caused by non-local food sources and a decoupling of expected d2H/d18O relationships as individuals consumed more meat and decreased in vivo non-essential amino acid production.",Symposium,NA,Christine_France,4,15,4,Th-afternoon

There is a long history of examining human lead exposure using trace element and isotope data in archaeological remains,¬†but most studies have sampled bone tissue, which is prone to diagenetic alteration. More recently, researchers are sampling tooth enamel, which is more likely to retain a biogenic record of lead exposure. Since teeth form during childhood and lead exposure reflects individuals‚Äô interactions with their physical and cultural environments, this tissue presents an intriguing means to examine childhood health. However, archaeological research often overlooks children as meaningful cultural actors. The consideration of childhood social theory can help to illuminate methodological and theoretical opportunities to produce better lead trace element and isotope data that can be more clearly incorporated into understanding the Child‚Äôs World. By examining the lead trace element and isotope values of tooth enamel produced using ICP-MS and MC-ICP-MS from individuals of historic Newfoundland populations, this paper will outline these considerations through a case study of childhood lead exposure in 18th¬†and early 19th¬†century Newfoundland.

Over 310 mortuary features have been uncovered during salvage excavations since the site was discovered in 1930, revealing a wide variability in mortuary practices that may reflect specific treatments for pathological or transgressive individuals after death. This paper describes analyses of burials uncovered during the 2017 field season utilizing the taphonomy-centered archaeothanatological approach to excavation and interpretation. Using this approach, specific consideration was given to a number of burials with destructive cranial lesions that may be evidence for the earliest known cases of treponemal disease in the North American Desert West. Additionally, deviant burials uncovered during past excavations were reconsidered for evidence of pathology only visible using archaeothanatological analyses. Analysis revealed new insights into the mortuary behavior of these early agriculturalists, particularly concerning corpse processing before primary inhumation as well as cultural understandings of sickness. This has implications regarding social organization and the array of observed burial patterns at La Playa, from cremation, single and multiple burials, and deviant burials. These findings paint a broader picture of prehistoric inhabitants of the Sonoran Desert for whom limited cultural material has survived.

Since digital camera documentation is already a standard practice at forensic scenes, additional data captured for CRP can be included alongside standard site photography. The purpose of this research is to demonstrate the utility of incorporating CRP into already established scene documentation protocols. To exhibit the process of outdoor scene documentation, three mock scenarios using faux human osteological material were created in a typical Central Florida pine flatwood environment: limited and large surface scatters, and a partial exhumation. Each scene was documented with a digital camera, both hand-held and mounted, as well as with and without ground control points. Overall, the 3D models constructed of the burial proved to be more conducive to CRP due to the uniformity of the ground surface.

Excavations at Monte Castelo site produced a representative assemblage of these early technologies, and has also demonstrated a long history of ceramic production and use, with significant changes during the Middle Holocene that accompany the intensification of landscape management and the emergence of several other cultural innovations in that period. In this presentation, we will bring the results of geochemical analyzes carried out on pottery remains and sediments from different strata of the site as well as from off-site areas, correlating its chronology with the paleoenvironmental scenario of southwestern Amazonia. In an attempt to contribute to the discussions about the characteristics of the emergence and the adoption of ceramic technology, some indications of its relation with the early process of landscape management that are marked in the history of occupation of the region will be further presented.",Symposium,NA,Francisco Antonio_Pugliese,3,11,3,Th-afternoon

Remarkable insights are gained about how ancient building materials were sustained and translated as architects and novices alike sought to align European design canons with local techniques and materials. Equally informative is how imported materials were incorporated into building practices.
 
In this paper, I analyze one of several construction techniques identified at Santa Cruz de Lancha, a Jesuit-managed hacienda in Pisco, Peru. The practice employed earthenware bottle fragments (botija) to create wall encasements or internal facing. Initially, the technique was thought to be a response to earthquake damage late in the site‚Äôs history. Recent discovery demonstrates an earlier precedent, and one with consistent application throughout the site. Analysis of the site‚Äôs ceramic assemblage informs questions about the choice of construction materials and draws attention to the range of imported and locally-produced earthenwares.

These findings widen the scope of building methods and materials utilized in viceregal building construction. They provide material evidence for ancient practices that were translated by Andean builders, and speak to their innovation.

Fire-cracked rocks, rounded river stones, and other rocks that are not obvious flaked or ground stone tools are a prominent component of archaeological sites that are little recorded and often not recovered from the field.

Figures appear in diverse media and sizes including stone, copper, shell, earthen effigy mounds, and petroglyphs/petrographs. In the literature, they are most frequently addressed as examples of art for the regions in which they are found, but rarely as pan-North American phenomena. A solely regional perspective implies that they only had local audiences. Human figures and disembodied parts are rarely examined, or compared/contrasted with reference to wider geographic regions as potentially having had diverse and travelling audiences. This regionalism has developed despite Omaha self-identification as having relocated several times, and the patchwork distribution of linguistic groups across North America for example, speakers of Siouan languages are found in both the Great Plains and South East. This research looks at full figures, hands, and hand and arm postures as one example of such widespread imagery. Hand and arm postures are significant not only for their variation in visual imagery, and in disembodied formats, but also their use in historic American Indian gestural sign language.

",Historic,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis,Trade and Exchange,"Tortoiseshell is made from the scutes of sea turtles; historically, hawksbill turtle was the main source of tortoiseshell but other species might have been used. Between the 17th and 18th c. tortoiseshell obtained in the Caribbean was traded on North American and European markets. Tortoiseshell was used for making combs, fans, boxes, in bookbinding, and as veneering for furniture. Excavations in European workshops (Paris and Amsterdam) attest of the use of this exotic material into luxurious items. However, archaeological fragments of tortoiseshell or artefacts have degraded, so that often the material has lost its recognizable tortoiseshell pattern, making identification to species difficult. 
The carapace and plastron of sea turtles are covered with keratinous scutes mainly composed of beta-keratins, a category of structural proteins that stack together to produce √ü-pleated sheet structures. Here, reference materials from five species of marine turtles were characterized by proteomics analysis to build a database of beta-keratin sequences and determine robust markers for species identification. Preliminary data have shown significant differences between hawksbill and green turtles, allowing distinction of these species in ancient materials. In addition, comb fragments from archaeological sites and workshops in France were examined.

This investigative study of black surface staining on mammalian sub-fossil bone excavated from the bed of the Santa Fe River in northern Florida exemplifies the need to carefully evaluate post-depositional alteration. Such stains typically are attributed to secondary mineralization of manganese oxides, however microanalysis revealed no evidence for manganese but instead identified crystals of pyrite within a thick red and black banded stain, identified as iron oxide and a ferric tannate complex respectively. Based upon multiple analytical methods, reaction mechanisms are proposed. This study debuts a novel sample preparation method for high-vacuum analysis of bone material, and demonstrates a cost-effective method to differentiate between damaging pyrite and other inert sulfur compounds in specimens. Results indicate that fossil coating types are extremely dependent upon the chemistry of the environment in which they are buried.

Additionally, contextual data indicate that the Spondylus was used in a least three ritual activities: as offering in burials; caches; and canceling of building.

Examination by high-resolution microanalysis (SEM-EDS, TEM, FTIR, micro-Raman) has revealed evidence pertaining to source selection of the iron-oxides used to produce the pictographs, the weathering and condition of the panels, and potential evidence for pigment enhancement by pyrotechnology. The pictographs at Boling Point were painted on an outcrop of argillaceous limestone covered in a kaolinitic weathering deposit. This natural canvas, and subsequent accretionary deposition, has aided in the long-term preservation of the panel. The pigment is composed of a homogenized mixture of ferrihydrite and hematite that was biogenically produced ex situ, most likely in a spring deposit, by aquatic iron-oxide producing bacteria, including Leptothrix ochracea and Gallionella spp. Preliminary results of high-sensitivity magnetometry also suggest that the pigment was thermally altered to induce iron oxide phase change to enhance colour properties.

",Paleolithic,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis,Material Culture and Technology,"The heat treatment of stone to enhance flaking attributes was an important advancement in the adaptive toolkit of early humans.  The earliest evidence for this is the heat treatment of silcrete 164 ka at the Middle Stone Age site Pinnacle Point 13B in South Africa.  Heating stone prior to knapping alters the physical and chemical composition of the stone, and it has long been recognized that flaked heat-treated stone has a glossier surface.  We expect this glossiness to result from a smoother flaked surface.  Thus, we investigated whether surface roughness, as measured by a 3D microscope, can be used as a proxy to identify the presence of heat treatment in the archaeological record.  The results of our unpublished pilot study suggested roughness parameters differ significantly between untreated and treated silcrete.  In the present study, we record values for multiple surface texture parameters on a sample of experimentally created stone tools from paired heat-treated and untreated silcrete nodules.  A Bayesian probability model, trained on the experimental sample, was then used to evaluate the probability individual artifacts have undergone heat treatment.

Here, we propose a new methodology for studying bone surface traces that will reduce the problems of unreliable and unreplicable results in more traditional qualitative analyses. We seek to understand the basics of use-wear formation over time by incrementally taking impressions of bone specimens subjected to a controlled, mechanical experiment. Our study assesses how bone wears during extended use on three materials (leather, fresh hide, or bark), starting from three modification states (unmodified, modified by flint or by sandstone). 3D surface texture analysis is used to quantitatively measure various features of bone surfaces, such as surface roughness [Sa], peak curvature [Spc], autocorrelation length [Sal], and lower material ratio [Smr2].

A more theoretical approach to use-wear is proposed here for understanding complex diversity of tool function. The concept of ‚Äútechnological organization‚Äù (by Binford) combined with settlement patterns along a river basin, is applied to traceological research in the Paleolithic of northeastern part of the Japanese archipelago. The Mogami River archaeological project and standardized experimental program of Tohoku University team provide concrete data bases of this methodological discussion. Investigations at the Kamino A site, the Takakurayama site, the Hakusan E and B sites of blade industry, the Araya and Kakuniyama sites of microblade industry, shed light on the theme of organizational approach to lithic use-wear.",Symposium,NA,Kaoru_Akoshima,4,15,4,Th-afternoon

In various geographic locations and time periods, human beings have been frequenting dark zones for ritual purposes. Regarding the unsuitable living conditions of dark zones, the following question arises: what drives humans to choose such places for practicing rituals? The answer to this question lies in the way human beings interact with dark cave environments. In this paper, I suggest that experiencing sensory deprivation, in particular lack of vision in dark zones, precipitates the enhancement of abstract and magical thinking. To verify this hypothesis, I employed the methods of cognitive scientists‚Äînamely, experimental research. I conducted an experiment using eye-tracking glasses to record participants‚Äô eye-movement trajectories in darkness. The results indicated that eye-movement patterns during darkness resemble that of activities involving abstract and primary process thinking (aka magical thinking). Consequently, darkness provokes and facilitates magical thinking. Thus, I suggest that in addition to social and cultural incentives, darkness, as an environmental cue, sets the stage for human beings to associate dark zones of caves with supernatural powers and therefore choose to practice rituals in such locations.

In the mid-13th century, the Tsegi Canyon region of northeastern Arizona followed a greater regional trend of communities coalescing into defensive high canyon alcoves, accompanied by the adoption of shield iconography, likely influenced by Freemont traditions to the north. These images are variously interpreted to represent clan symbols, warning signs to enemies, or magically imbued protective icons. In the Tsegi area, this motif followed a strict spatial pattern of placing large, usually white, shield imagery on the right side of cliff dwellings. By comparing the spatial placement of shield imagery on Pueblo III sites throughout the Northern Southwest, it is evident that the communities of the Tsegi Canyon system may be differentiated through their commitment to the placement of these iconic, highly visible pictographs on the right side of cliff dwellings.

Results indicate that specific watercraft and their associated paraphernalia represent the earliest temple as the mound of creation, 3250 BCE, a window into the politico-religious foundations of the Egyptian State.

",Iron Age,Experimental Archaeology,Subsistence and Foodways,"In this paper, I discuss the value of recreating ancient beers for archaeological research. Increasingly, reconstructions of ancient alcoholic beverages have appeared in the popular news cycle. These recreations are typically one-offs and rely on limited archaeological evidence, for example residue analysis from a single vessel. Such attempts, however, miss the opportunity to explore the greater variety of beers that were consumed in the past (with different adjuncts, wild yeasts, grain combinations, preparation techniques, etc.) and the place of these drinks within their broader gastronomic and dietary context. 

During the past two years, I have pursued an integrative program of reconstructing beers from the Greco-Roman periphery (ca. 600 BCE-500 CE). By combining the surprisingly vast collection of Greek and Latin references to ancient beers, the archaeobotanical remains from individual settlements and cultures, broader archaeological and artistic evidence, and complementary food and wine preparations, I have produced several complete beers, individual components of beer (e.g. malts), adjunct-beer combinations, and brewing techniques. With this experimental archaeology, I demonstrate the diversity of research questions that can be addressed, especially those related to the dissemination of technological knowledge, ancient diet, agriculture, and feasting.

Archaeological evidence has documented a particular maize variety called tunqu by indigenous speaking populations, generally cultivated on terraces around the Copacabana Peninsula between 3810 to 4100 masl, in the Lake Titicaca Basin, Bolivia. This is the first known maize variety cultivated above 3600 masl. There were wide-spread landscape modifications such as raised fields and terraces geared to the cultivation of food crops by pre-Columbian civilizations of this region. Colonial accounts emphasize this high altitude maize was primarily consumed as maize beer (aqha, or chicha) and central to ritual offerings extending back to the Yaya Mama religious tradition (ca. 800 BCE). Its phenotypic characteristic are unique, unlike any other known landrace. It appears to be an endemic maize variety, unique to this part of the Titicaca Basin. Evapotranspiration around the lake reduces the diurnal variation in temperatures just enough for maize cultivation to be possible in the Bolivian altiplano. Its prehistory, cultivation, preparation and consumption among indigenous cultures are analyzed as are its botanical and biological characteristics.

While domesticates can often be readily distinguished from their wild progenitors both genetically and morphologically, the steps leading to domestication (transport, selective harvest, deliberate seed dispersal, active plant management, i.e. cultivation) can be difficult to track archaeologically. Techniques for identifying morphological changes in macrobotanical remains (e.g. seeds, fruits, caryopses) from archaeological sites have been well established, but there are virtually no systematic studies on how to identify morphological changes in microbotanical remains (e.g. starch granules) despite claims that larger granules are characteristic of domesticated species. Here we test the hypothesis that domesticated plants produce larger starch granules than their wild progenitors. We measured granules from the Four Corners potato (Solanum jamesii) that were a) grown in the wild, b) associated with archaeological sites, c) propagated in a greenhouse, and d) cultivated in a garden.

Relatively little is known about WBT human-plant interaction as compared to their maize-bean-squash cultivating Iroquoian neighbors. Culture-historical models of the WBT are proving to be outdated, overemphasizing the supposed difference between WBT ‚Äòhunter-gatherer‚Äô subsistence strategies and Iroquoian farming. Recent isotopic analyses have suggested archaeologists have been underestimating the amount of maize consumed among the WBT peoples at this time, and limited excavation and botanical analysis has hindered the revision of our understanding of their subsistence practices. Plant remains from the Arkona Cluster sites, however, show WBT peoples were indeed cultivating maize, calling into question our conceptualization of their food production, landscape construction, and mobility. Paleoethnobotanical methods were employed to elucidate plant-human interaction of these culturally-distinct peoples residing at the periphery of Iroquoian territory and influence. This paper will present macrobotanical data from flotation sampling, as well as micro-fossil (starch grain) data from ceramic and groundstone residues to provide more meaningful cross-cultural comparisons of food production during the early Late Woodland period in Ontario.

The food habits of past human societies are of importance because the act of cooking is a central task for humans, and various social phenomena influence the activities of food procurement and production. The research question guiding this investigation is What status differences can be identified between Gamo Mala and Gamo Tsoma-mala society through the archaeobotanical analysis of charred plant remains, and to what extent does this information reflect aspects of social identity and community boundaries‚Äù. The status differences were not identifiable since the archaeobotanical assemblages were composed of similar taxa.

The Neo-Assyrian empire is known as one of the major empires in the Ancient Near East. Ruling in Mesopotamia during the Iron Age, they had a well-organized agricultural system. In this paper, I will utilize phytolith analyses to investigate the impact of the Neo-Assyrian empire on agriculture and land-use. I will compare the elite-controlled agriculture with the crop choices of peasant farmers. It‚Äôs likely that the peasant farmers would have choosen more resistant and reliable types of plants for their own food which would reduce the risks of unexpected natural disasters such as droughts and floods. In order to conduct this research, I use phytolith data from Iraqi Kurdistan, at on-going excavations of Assyrian-period sites in the Peshdar Plain, including two main sites: Gird-l Bazar and Qalat-l Dinka, directed by Professor Karen Radner, University of Munich. These two sites are very promising for this research. Gird-l Bazar is a non-elite farming and production village, and Qalat-l Dinka is an administrative center being sustained by Gird-l Bazar. Thus, the two will cover the empire‚Äôs impact on agriculture and the farmers‚Äô choices in cultivation and production.

The Milwaukee Public Museum houses one such collection, which includes zoological material, textile fragments, tools, and carbonized botanicals and food. This paper focuses on the collection of plants and food, which come from Robenhausen, a lake-dwelling site south of Zurich. In studying this collection, there are a variety of factors that preclude traditional paleoethnobotanical methods. First, the protocol for handling carbonized botanicals from waterlogged sites is to maintain their moisture content, which is an impossibility in this context. In addition, since these excavations were carried out in the 1800s, artifacts were removed from the site without regard for stratigraphy and excavations were funded through the sale of Lake Dwelling objects, making quantification of these assemblages impossible. This paper examines the Milwaukee Public Museum‚Äôs collection of botanical and food remains, given the limitations inherent in the study of waterlogged carbonized material excavated before modern paleoethnobotanical methods were developed.

Here, we use a multivariate technique, multiple correspondence analysis, to analyze the graves at Chiribaya Alta. Sex is not included in this analysis and thus, the MCA groups graves without assuming a binary construction of sex. Instead, sex information is only used in the interpretation phase of the analysis. Our MCA confirms that Chiribaya graves are differentiated by gender based on funerary objects but shows greater variation in the graves of females in comparison to males, suggesting that women‚Äôs gendered activities were more variable than those of men. Furthermore, the overlap in the graves of males and females suggests that these gender categories are not binary opposites, and thus we suggest an alternative system for conceptualizing gender identity in the Chiribaya polity.

Mortuary practices involve living-dead interactions that transform the status of the deceased. Historical sources and archaeological research suggest that chullpas in the south-central Andean highlands featured protracted living-dead interactions. Few investigations, however, have examined these tombs on the Peruvian coast. Here, we use data from five seasons of archaeological fieldwork and analysis to model sequences of chullpa mortuary activities in the middle Chincha Valley, located on the Peruvian southern coast. These data indicate multi-stage processes comprising tomb entry and reentry for depositing, manipulating, and re-depositing human remains, and making offerings of varying types to the dead. Throughout these sequences, local groups performed elaborate forms of postmortem body manipulation. Our model supports and nuances previous scholarship on chullpas by characterizing chullpa mortuary activities as part of a dynamic and extended program for curating and venerating the dead in the study area.

The geological constitution of Sicily is enough complex as the characteristics of the geological units are consequences of the tectonic compression that happened between the beginning of Miocene and the beginning of the Pliocene. Three structural units are basically distinguished :

This reconceptualization of space has highlighted the ways in which the production of landscapes is integral to the creation, maintenance, and negation of social inequality and political authority. Recent archaeological approaches to studying inequality through landscape have taken a variety of forms, including analyses of political architectonics, panoptic spaces, and pre-existing places. An equally important practice includes transforming, or claiming to transform, wilderness into a built environment. Such claims affirm rulers‚Äô abilities to impose order on chaos and to control the natural, or seemingly natural, world by destroying it. This presentation argues that political leaders bolster their authority not only by proclaiming their ability to turn wildernesses into built environments, but also by emphasizing their ability to turn built environments into wildernesses.

The Andean south, with its center in Arequipa, had a traditional mercantile basis that favored improvements in trade, particularly those that resulted in the rapprochement of the city of Arequipa to the sea. After independence (1821-1824), new ports were established; the operation of certain coves sanctioned; and extractive activities shaped the region. The ports on the Arequipa coast supplied markets across the Andean south and Bolivia, and were a necessary and desired stop for European and North American ships sailing the Pacific. The economic networks that operated throughout the Arequipa coast encompassed a vast portion of the population. The region was strategic for the mercantile classes across the Andean south, the national government and foreign dignitaries in charge of the Peruvian trade. Utilizing archaeological, cartographic and documentary sources, and modeling in Geographical Information Systems, this presentation outlines the ways in which ideas of development global commodity trade impacted the configuration of the southern coastal landscapes, from the extraction of guano to the establishment of new ports and the construction of railroads.",Symposium,NA,Maria Fernanda_Boza Cuadros,4,15,4,Th-afternoon

With careful and complex design, these structures were built to represent the affluence of those who resided within their confines. While the external fa√ßade of a palace represents the defining barrier between the elite and the public, the architectural layouts of ancient palaces reveal multiple levels of exclusivity. The varying levels of privacy in different palaces may relate to the differing roles and functions that palaces fulfilled across the ancient world. In some contexts palaces were simply a grandiose residence for the ruling elite, whereas elsewhere they fulfilled political, religious, administrative, economic and military functions. Furthermore, the accessibility of the inner areas of palaces might reflect the gulf between rulers and subjects, or the overall safety of the elite. We apply a space syntax analysis to several ancient palatial complexes to measure privacy and accessibility. We compare the results to identify patterned variability in the level of restriction between palaces, which might be structured by the presumed function of the palaces (military, economic, religious, residential, and administrative), the broader bases of political power in the society, or the level of societal complexity.

",Bronze Age,Digital Archaeology: GIS,Landscape Archaeology,"Howard Carter discovered the relatively intact tomb of Tutankhamun (KV 62), one of the last kings of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, in the Valley of the Kings in 1922. Prior to the discovery, Carter discovered several small artifacts in the cliffs above the valley‚Äôs floor, which he proclaimed were indicators of a possible escape route of the ancient tomb raiders from the Valley of the Kings. During the excavation of the tomb, Carter also claimed to have identified two distinct robberies that most likely occurred with a few years of the initial interment. Other scholars have debated this assertion. A spatial analysis of the Valley the Kings will provide insight into this debate. This paper will investigate the possible routes ancient robbers may have taken while escaping from the tomb of Tutankhamun through the utilization of Geographical Information System (GIS) analyses including viewshed and least cost pathways. The most efficient route out of the valley will determine if Carter‚Äôs initial claim of finding dropped artifacts from the tomb was in correct or not.

The Nubian pharaohs began construction of necropoles near the Fourth cataract of the Nile.  While Kush material culture in the form of royal statuary and temple architecture indicates a reaffirmation of classical Egyptian practices, what is the relationship between Nubian and Egyptian royal identity on a landscape level?

Controlling the variation of production in regard to fluctuating natural and social pressures was critical to past agrarian societies and undoubtedly played a role in the development of their intensive agricultural strategies. This is addressed by examining the geo-intensive agricultural strategy of the ancient Maya located in the hilly region of the North Vaca Plateau, Belize. The GIS modeling of a combined assemblage of datasets that include archaeological fieldwork, remote sensing (LiDAR), pedological analysis, and climatic reconstructions reveals the functional qualities of the agricultural terracing that forms the basis of the production strategy in this region. Results present the properties of terracing in relation to hydrological flow and erosion as well as their ability to increase land suitability for production by decreasing variation in the face of climatic fluctuations.

",Bronze Age,Digital Archaeology: GIS,Political Economy,"There is a recursive relationship between socio-economic institutions and the environment. Decisions about where to place settlements in a landscape were informed by existing economic institutions, but placement of sites in turn effected how social and economic institutions were organized. In this paper, I present a new GIS-based method for quantifying socio-economic organization and change in prehistoric societies. Catchment analyses, as employed in this study, define the availability of economic resources for individual settlements. This approach then quantifies cultural preferences across settlement systems. As a case study, I monitor settlement systems throughout the Early and Middle Bronze Age in southwest Transylvania. Southwest Transylvania is a major metal producing region that underwent significant socio-economic changes as metal became commodified throughout the European Bronze Age. Using catchment analysis, I demonstrate that communities in metal-rich landscapes increasingly prioritized access to agricultural land and access to interregional trade routes over metal ore sources. This result challenges existing narratives for how increasingly complex societies emerged in late prehistoric Europe. The method presented in this paper is easily transferable to other regional contexts and can be an additional tool for archaeologists exploring socio-economic organization and change in the past.",Symposium,NA,Colin_Quinn,4,15,4,Th-afternoon

As the rural economy of New England shifted to a more urban and industrial one, much of this agricultural land was abandoned and subsequently reforested. The vestiges of this once rural landscape can now best be seen in LiDAR imagery, in which features such as stonewalls are particularly well discernible. Though the spatial and temporal dimensions of reforestation vary across the region, this paper investigates the extent to which the forest vegetation present today reflects the legacy of land-use evidenced by historical documents and LiDAR imagery. Using these data to precisely identify areas of prior deforestation and intensive land-use, the forest vegetation now present is analyzed through historic CORONA and modern high resolution multispectral satellite imagery to¬†track the progress of reforestation as well as investigate spectral properties that are unique to such areas. In doing so, the legacy of deforestation and abandonment in New England can be better understood, and new tools provided for the study of this landscape in areas where stonewalls are not as frequent or well preserved.

However, new technical developments are bringing another dimension to these old sources of information. Many historic aerial photos were taken in a series of densely overlapping photos to minimize the effects of lens distortion for use in surveillance, cartography, or other purposes where accuracy in measurement was important. While useful, the resulting photos also create stereoscopic sets that are ideal for analysis using photogrammetric methods. These techniques allow researchers to generate three-dimensional reconstructions of the landscape as it existed when the photos were taken. The resulting models can then be compared to models generated from modern imagery to examine landscape dynamics on a regional or local scale at extraordinarily high resolutions. Very small changes to the landscape, and to individual archaeological sites can be mapped, measured and analyzed. In some cases, it is even possible to explore sites that have ceased to exist today.

Moreover, through the GEE platform, users can create custom scripts to suit their specific research questions and needs. This paper explores potential contributions of GEE to archaeological research through two case studies. First, GEE was used to automatically identify specific archaeological features across the Faynan region of Southern Jordan. Second, GEE-based edge-detection and automatic vectorization was tested for mapping archaeological sites at the Iron Age (ca. 1200‚Äì900 BCE) site of Khirbat al-Jariya in Faynan. Through these trials, GEE proved a viable tool for archaeological research with significant potential to supplement traditional forms of archaeological survey and mapping.

Drones are becoming more affordable with sensors capable of capturing imagery at sub-meter resolutions. Ground cover classification allows further investigation into land use, disturbance and site integrity. This paper discusses the use of supervised and object based classification methods using image analysis software and high-resolution imagery obtained from unmanned aerial systems. It also discusses the use of multispectral imagery in drone-based survey applications and capabilities for classification based on varying image resolutions. Best practices for maintaining resolution and image integrity are discussed along with processing capabilities based on project goals. A training area located near Peruís North Coast is used to create classification parameters, which is then tested against similar areas on the North coast. Utilizing this method, we are able to classify land use, disturbances, and cultural sites with some limitations.

Starting from harvesting resources in pre-historical times, to building maritime infrastructures in classical and medieval times, to present day maritime leisure touristic activities. Our research stems from a CRM project that spanned almost three years of research. Within this project was done remote sensing, underwater archaeology, cultural and ethnographic studies, resulting in several interesting finds and a better understanding of this Lagoon. We intend to present a journey into this area in its broader concept.

Since moulds were used to shape the heads, our initial hypothesis was to perform a quantitative comparison of head shapes based on digital scan data. Comparison of scan data is straight forward and is very similar to quality control and inspection processes in industrial applications. Initial analysis was performed on older scan data. In addition, a high-resolution fringe projection scanner was employed to scan further head vases in museums in Germany and Italy. Scan resolution and accuracy of approximately 0.1 mm in all dimensions were required to reveal differences below 1 mm. Shape analysis results of the head areas confirm that it is likely that the same mould was used for shaping some of the head vases.

While research pursued in the dTFA framework has gained momentum over the intervening decades, questions regarding its reliability if not legitimacy have also emerged. Arguably, this critical pushback is the result of the tacit but persistent reluctance both of advocates and critics to give full formal expression to dTFA‚Äôs core theory. In turn, this reluctance has led to the inadvertent conflation of the program‚Äôs foundational principles and its special-case conditions, as well as to vague impressions regarding the degree to which non-demographic forces obscure demographic information in tfds. In response, I explicitly formalize Rick‚Äôs framework as a functional decomposition of the tfd DGP.

Building monuments is costly in terms of time and energy, and yet it is difficult to see how it contributes to survival and reproduction. In the late 1980s, Dunnell argued that monument building and other apparently wasteful behaviors are in fact adaptive in environments that are characterized by severe and/or unpredictable perturbations. Such behaviors are adaptive, according to Dunnell, because groups that undertake them will have lower birth rates than groups that do not and therefore will be less likely to experience food shortages in bad years. In addition, wasteful behaviors are adaptive because they represent a reservoir of time and energy that can be devoted to subsistence and/or reproduction in times of difficulty. Here, we report the results of a study in which we tested the waste hypothesis with an agent-based model in which the severity and predictability of environmental threats and the agents‚Äô propensity to waste time and energy were varied systematically.

Virtual archaeology including 3D objects, reconstruction of building structures and even past landscape scenes has been for several years a standard and specific way of documentation and interpretation. However, what is currently changing is the general availability of the necessary technologies. A common feature of new software solutions and new technological equipment is their high user-friendliness, which allows high-quality outputs without deeper knowledge of the issue or prior extended training. Another new important aspect is the low acquisition price of the software and equipment as compared to the previous period; moreover, many freeware tools have been created. Last but not least, there are new platforms for easy presentation and sharing of virtual data.

In particular, this paper will analyze several types of instruments, including specific categories of ocarinas, globular flutes, and rattles. Certain types of instruments were made more frequently than others, and this research attempts to understand the cultural significance of these categories of artifacts. This paper will also describe the use of digital experimental archaeology as a useful tool when attempting to understand the internal structure of instruments, as numerous instruments have been recreated digitally, and then 3D printed.

Subsequent sea level rise slowly submerged the site, 4 m of sediment buried the site, and the sinkhole became part of the Aucilla River channel.  This scenario was repeated at multiple sites, creating a rich underwater record of archaeological sites dating to the Late Pleistocene in Northwest Florida.

Since 2003, the Norwegian Maritime Museum has had several extensive excavations in the area of Bj√∏rvika in the harbour of Oslo as a measure to document archaeological remains before being removed or covered during the rapid urban development of the area. This paper will discuss two of the major sites that have yielded 29 well-preserved boat wrecks and large areas of previously unknown harbour constructions of timber. Boats and constructions date to the 16th and early 17th century and varies from small boats of around five meters length to 20 meters long ships. All but one are built in the Nordic clinker technique. 
The museum made the decision early to retrieve all boats and document every boat part with a digital 3D Faro-arm. We have chosen to use a combination of digital and traditional methods of documentation including cardboard models of the boats using 3D prints. In the process of building replicas of the boats, we have experienced the subjective contribution and practical knowledge of the older generation of boat archaeologists and skilled boat builders to be of great value to compliment the ‚Äúobjective‚Äù digital methods.

In some ways, the lumping of shipwrecks and submerged landscapes into one category is beneficial, since many of the same tools, methods, and issues affect both submerged landscapes and historic resources. However, key differences are also present in both site distribution (shipwrecks are by nature portable sites) and theoretical approaches to identifying sites and investigating them.

We associate these trends with intervals of warmer and wetter climate, specifically the Roman and Medieval Warm Periods, respectively, as revealed by local pollen samples as well as regional and global climate models.

Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey, in combination with stratigraphic information from limited excavation, can serve as a powerful tool for making rapid cultural resource management decisions. Although processing and correlating the data requires several days of additional time, this technique allows for quick and efficient data collection, is nondestructive, requires minimal staff, and provides a continuous record of vertical profiles across the site. The contrasting electrical properties of shell-rich horizons and associated sediments allow the identification of midden layers on the GPR records. When used with ground-truth, provided by stratigraphic information from limited excavation (photographs, hand-drawn wall profiles, and/or cores), the interpreter can extrapolate stratigraphic details across a site. While individual artifacts cannot be resolved in GPR records, accumulations of rocks, soil layers, and potential house floors may be identified.

THE SHELL MIDDENS OF MAINE AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF PEACE,North America: Northeast and Midatlantic,Woodland,Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology,Monumentality,"Although some attention has been given to the possibility that circular, semi-circular, and U-shaped piles of shell in southeastern North America represent monumental architecture (e.g., Thompson and Pluckhahn 2012), little attention has been afforded to the possibility that large shell middens of the eastern North American coast might be monumental constructions. Here, using an argument drawn from New Guinea ethnography, we hypothesize that some Maine middens were not simply rubbish heaps, but conspicuous constructions that, among other things, maintained peace among neighboring aboriginal polities. 
Behavioral ecologists theorize that, as honest signals of fighting strength, threat displays and ritualized fighting are information-gathering devices that allow both parties to a conflict to establish the victor without either having to risk the potentially catastrophic costs of serious fighting (Enquist and Leimar 1990). Analogously, we propose, some Maine shell middens were indexical signals of a polity‚Äôs fighting strength that helped maintain peace by mediating inter-polity conflict. As signals of consumption, scale of feasting, and available food resources, the middens broadcast the number of members and allies a polity could muster, as well as their commitment to its projects. The hypothesis gains support from the distribution of both middens and their contents.

The impact of coastal erosion and sea level rise on archaeological sites creates significant challenges for Indigenous peoples engaged in reclaiming their own histories and rights. Archaeologists studying threatened sites must therefore also be deeply engaged with Indigenous partners, whose history is literally being swept out to sea. Our paper outlines the goals and aims of the COASTAL archaeology project, which seeks to develop a shared-authority partnership with Indigenous collaborators. We also outline methodological challenges and opportunities of working on Nova Scotia‚Äôs coastlines, and highlight the need for tailored strategies to address the erosion issue.

The methods used include developing a protocol for micro-excavations of intact sample blocks, soil micromorphology of petrographic thin sections, and FTIR on loose sediment samples and the petrographic thin sections. Micro-excavations allowed for the identification of sub-centimeter artifacts that would have been lost in the field. Soil micromorphological analysis revealed the presence of microstratigraphic layers invisible to the naked eye, microscopic shell fragments in putative ‚Äúshell-less‚Äù layers, and evidence of pre-, syn-, and post-depositional shell and bone alterations.

As a result, they record past lifeways, terrestrial and marine species distributions/seasonality, and environmental conditions. The buffering effect of the decomposition of carbonate shells yields preservation of organic artifacts that are often not preserved in other settings.

Learning to be an archaeologist is a craft that comes in many forms from formal academic training, field and lab work, to informal unstructured experiences.  These become known through academic degrees, peer reviewed publications, project reports, conference presentations and interactions with peers, colleagues, the public and even the media. Formal training is listed in detail in personal vitae and may be measured and judged by the outputs but how we do archaeology as individuals is also the result of our personal experiences, not least of which are the projects we work on and the people with whom we work and interact.  Legends of the Dinsmore Hilton chronicle these experiences. To date, these are primarily in the form of oral tradition as many of the participants are still extant and written versions might be subject to civil suits.  As time passes my memory becomes ever more selective and inventive.  Never the less, working for and with Dennis on the High Plains of Eastern Colorado in the mid-1970s has had a fundamental influence on who I have become as an archaeologist and person.

At the urging of John M. (‚ÄúJack‚Äù) Campbell he began work near Point Barrow in 1968 to investigate controversial questions about the origins of Thule culture.  Following brief investigations at the Utkiavik site, he focused his excavations south of Barrow at Walakpa, where he discovered more than 20 stratigraphic levels documenting the transition from Birnirk to Thule cultures.  His analysis led him to conclude that the transition from Birnirk to Thule was correlated to climate change and possibly an over-reliance on seal hunting.  His subsequent research interest in Alaska have focused the relationships between eastern Beringia and the first colonization of the Americas.  In 1989-90 he served as Visiting Distinguished Professor, at the Alaskan Quaternary Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks where he taught Paleoindian archeology and mentored students.

Spanish colonies were, moreover, a catalysis of cross-cultural exchange, conflict, and persistence as colonists, merchants, and various indigenous individuals and groups moved throughout the empire. It is thus an ideal setting to explore questions of ethnogenesis and the persistence of local and indigenous traditions in old and new contexts. This paper offers a broad, comparative exploration of the archaeology and ethnohistory of ethnogenesis, persistence, and the many permutations of identity throughout the Spanish Empire. It sets up a conceptual framework for the case studies that follow, representing seven world regions.",Electronic Symposium,Presenter,Christine_Beaule,4,16,4,Th-afternoon

",Contact Period,Ethnohistory/History,Colonialism,"Throughout the late Spanish colonial period, the Dagua River in Colombia‚Äôs Cauca Valley was a multi-cultural backwater. Its shores were inhabited by mestizos, mulattos, slaves, and free slaves, with a minority of Indians and Spaniards. While this area was mined for gold and offered one of few routes to the Pacific from Colombia‚Äôs interior, the Dagua River region was largely cut off from global trade and colonial currents due to its geographical remoteness. 50 days distant from Cartagena and 14 from the nearest town, Cali, it was just beyond the reach of Spanish colonial authorities. 

For the Dagua‚Äôs largely self-governing and self-sustaining inhabitants, including African slaves, topographical challenges such as steep cordilleras, dense tropical jungles, and torrential rivers gave rise to social, cultural, and economic opportunities. Spaniards, who theoretically were in control as hacendados, merchants, and miners, depended on forasteros‚ÄîFrench doctors, Italian notaries, and African slaves. African slaves in the Dagua region came to wield great power and autonomy, controlling terrestrial and river commerce, effectively fighting royal aguardiente and tobacco monopolies, buying their freedom, and building free slave communities. Their descendants would inhabit this area into the early twentieth century. Methods are art historical, historical, cartographic, and ethnographic.

The first European settlers were favoured with privileges by the Portuguese monarchy face to the continental traders in the relations with African coast. Since 1472, they were forced to carry out the exchanges with local goods. It would encourage the development of cotton and sugarcane crops with slaves from the ""Guinea Rivers"", a widely model lately repeated in other Atlantic islands and the American colonies. 
The excavations in carried out in Cidade Velha, first capital of the islands, recovered archaeological materials from the Iberian Peninsula and other places of Europe, Africa and China. Material evidences useful to explore early Atlantic commercial networks. Along the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries, this commercial activity was accompanied by the circulation of people, languages and ideas.
The loss over the slave trade led to a gradual economic decline which, coupled with environmental constraints, the shortage of European settlers and the absence of indigenous population from the islands, would help an early fusion of people and culture, giving rise to the present Creole Cape Verdean national identity.

",Historic,Ethnohistory/History,Colonialism,"The shift to wet-rice cultivation and construction of rice terraces in Ifugao, Philippines has recently been associated with Spanish colonization. Previously thought to be at least 2,000 years old, investigations in the region have now established that wet-rice cultivation was a response of highland populations to the Spanish conquest at ca. 1650 CE.  The shift to an intensive cultivation drastically changed Ifugao social organization that allowed them to successfully resist multiple attempts of the Spanish to place them under the colonial administration.   Contemporary Ifugao identity is based on the narrative of being uncolonized as well as centered on wet-rice cultivation.  Even when the market economy exerts pressure on the agricultural system, Ifugao families endeavor to continue producing wet-rice and sponsor rice-planting rituals.  The persistence of wet-rice farming and rice rituals are interpreted as an active resistance of the Ifugao against assimilation to the larger Philippine society and conscious acts of maintaining their identity.  Utilizing archaeological, ethnographic, spatial, productivity, and energetics data associated with wet-rice cultivation, this presentation aims to illustrate the continuity of Ifugao struggle against hegemonic cultures.

Despite repeated historical retelling, little attention has been paid to the structures of the cross-cultural encounters described in the original narratives. Ethno-historical analysis reveals an extraordinary diversity of responses in these interactions, from prosaic trading, through to wilful acts of physical and sexual aggression, and highly charged spiritual contests. While the Spanish presence was largely ephemeral, with even the nascent colonies lasting only several weeks, the sometimes dramatic shifts in status from transitory explorer, to colonist, to survivor often resulted in similarly significant transformations in relations with indigenous groups. Beyond the documentary record, the archaeological record also shows evidence of longer-term repercussions and attempts by indigenous groups to mitigate these transitory exchanges.

Bringing together ethnohistoric accounts, oral histories, and archaeological data in Nejapa and Tavela, I highlight three case studies to show that migration, conquest, and interregional trade created a complex, dynamic, pluralistic ethnic landscape prior to the arrival of the Spanish.  As such, when the Spanish colonial regime took hold in the Sierra Sur, people in Nejapa and Tavela were already accustomed to making strategic choices about how to engage.  Some distanced themselves from migrants, merchants, and militaries, while others embraced new opportunities for trade and exchange.  Some used the Spanish legal system to protect or solidify their social and political standing, while others persisted in maintaining subversive and secret indigenous religious practices and spaces.  Enslaved Africans, government officials, priests, and residents of various castas likewise struggled to find their places.  Understanding the dynamics of the pluralistic cultural landscape of Colonial Nejapa requires bringing together various threads of evidence and accepting that identities in Nejapa were, and always had been, multiple, changing, and global, across time and space, before, during, and after Spanish colonialism.",Electronic Symposium,Presenter,Stacie_King,4,16,4,Th-afternoon

Portugal and Spain share centuries of culture history, religion, and governance, and were united under the Iberian Union between 1580 and 1640. Yet within the context of European expansion into the non-Western world, they have often been considered distinct with regard to their histories and as foci of study. Pushing beyond national pasts, this paper contextualizes Portuguese and Spanish intersections with varied African people and polities in terms of both the wider socioeconomic landscapes of which they were part and the local conditions and contingencies that mitigated policy, and structured locally articulated social, cultural, and economic interactions. While inescapably nested in European nationalist agendas and global economy, the cultural exchanges of Portugal and Spain in Africa were characterized more by variability than by unitary templates, more by persistence than hegemonic change. Often they were expressly non-colonial in aspiration or affect.

Moving beyond dichotomies of colonizer/colonized, dominance/resistance, or aggressors/passive recipients of change, we offer a more nuanced, comparative exploration. Encounters between agents of the Spanish State and native communities quickly created a web of pluralistic, global cross-cultural interactions. Spanish colonies in each region were hotbeds of cross-cultural exchange and conflict, including the creation and recreation of identities, as well as the persistence of local and indigenous traditions in old and new places and contexts. Within these multi-cultural contexts, archaeological approaches to ethnogenesis pay close attention to patterned material practices that signify identity formation, manipulation and reinforcement.

A salient research topic within broader investigations of conflict is how populations cope with chronic warfare. This presentation utilizes geostatistical analyses of architectural and topographical features to reconstruct defensive coping mechanisms among LIP groups living in 12 fortified settlements in the southern Nasca highlands of Peru. Analytical results reveal a regional defensive pattern whereby the smallest most vulnerable groups invested the most in fortifications and occupied the least accessible hilltops. Variation in fortification investment within each site was driven by differences in the accessibility of approaches leading to a site‚Äôs residential sector. This research demonstrates that LIP populations made optimal trade-offs between competing defensive variables, revealing highly patterned regional defensive strategies that vary from defensive practices observed in other LIP regions. This variation is likely the result of groups implementing defensive strategies to cope with local patterns of warfare.

The case of Chunchucmil, a large Maya site located in northwest Yucatan, Mexico, challenges this common approach to neighborhood integration. At Chunchucmil, neighborhoods are clearly defined but centralized authority is not. Thus, we must set aside the question of neighborhoods being weakly or strongly integrated with centralized authority and instead ask how neighborhoods constitute authority itself. In a densely populated, decentralized city, how can neighborhoods be seen as factions whose competition and cooperation produce authority?

In some ancient cities, the urban periphery appeared as autonomous communities prior to the development of a center, representing an ‚Äòoutside-in‚Äô model of urbanism. Such contexts provide a valuable case study for investigating neighborhood integration into cities, due to a clear comparative temporal threshold (before and after incorporation). This presentation explores how a small community transitioned into a low density urban neighborhood in a larger city, and how the local elites at its apex transformed into intermediate elites in an emergent three tier political system. The Late-Terminal Classic (AD 700-900) Maya polity of Lower Dover, Belize offers potential for examining this issue because the center arose in the midst of several long-established, Middle Preclassic (1000-400 BC) communities. This presentation identifies the ways in which the lives of the inhabitants of the Tutu Uitz Na neighborhood changed during the Late Classic as it transitioned from an autonomous community to become amalgamated into a polity.

Most of these centers were organized around clusters of walled enclosures with duplicate domestic facilities interpreted as multi-functional residential complexes, or compounds. Based on spatial, architectural and excavation data, these compounds are interpreted as major foci of daily activities and interactions, as well as public events housed in patios and plazas at the heart of most compounds. Depending on their scale and complexity, some of the compounds can be considered neighborhoods. In this paper, we explore what the neighborhood concept entails for these groups in terms of sociopolitical organization through a review of Early Horizon excavation and settlement pattern data. Major variables include: ‚Äúcompact‚Äù and ‚Äúdispersed‚Äù architectural patterns; ephemeral, generational, and multi-generational architectural scales ; access patterns ; life cycles of compounds ; and material patterns of use.

I argue that the intermediate scale of the neighborhood is best suited for analyzing how local- and state-level power structures intermix on the ground. Neighborhoods within cities capture both the everyday life of a diversity of residents, and articulate with larger state institutions and political economy. While the dynamic model is now widely accepted, very few studies show how state actors and local people actually navigate growing and waning power levels. I operationalize such dynamics through the lens of Collective Action Theory, which specifically addresses the role of state actors in the everyday life of local residents through the concept of infrastructural power.

Fire, which is symbolic of the life cycle in Maya ideology, has been used as a means of communicating with the supernatural world in order to manage specific aspects of everyday life, such as the success of the agricultural season. In the archaeological record, we find evidence for ancient fires as features consisting mostly of burnt plant remains, some of which resemble modern Maya fire altars both materially and spatially. In this paper we present archaeological and paleoethnobotanical evidence from fire features recently excavated within E-Group complexes at the sites of Early Xunantunich and Buenavista del Cayo. We argue that the characteristics of these features suggest that these fires were ritual in nature. Therefore, the types of plants used to start and fuel these ritual fires likely held special significance to the ancient Maya as they were ‚Äúsacrificed‚Äù to the Gods.

Plant use may also vary between households. By examining this variation, botanical data may yield further information on personal preference and cuisine differences between households. Aside from consumption for subsistence, plants were used for a wide range of activities conducted by individual households. Botanical datasets may reveal other activities such as fertilization of garden plots or ritual activities. 
This paper examines the botanical diversity found in Late-to-Terminal Classic households near the site of Xunantunich in Belize. The paper discusses on-going research at the site and focuses on macrobotanical analysis of activity areas. The results are part of a larger research design combining both macrobotanical and microbotanical data which seeks to overcome some of the biases that are inherent in single methods of analysis. By incorporating macrobotanical and microbotanical remains, a wide range of plant remains will be represented that may be absent from carbonized assemblages alone.

Recent paleoethnobotanical and archaeological studies at Tikal, however, bring some insight to this cultural black box. Three examples from the paleoethnobotanical record provide empirical evidence that indicate how the Maya elite managed their forests, set aside certain tracts of land for special agricultural projects and constructed an irrigation system to reduce the vagaries of rainfall-dependent agriculture. The first example relates to the enormous beams of sapodilla (Manilkara zapota) wood that were used to construct Temples 1-4 and only could have come from old growth forests, likely in a protected context, as in a pak‚Äô-al.

Ancient DNA research has advanced so much that genomic data from thousands of individuals across the globe are now available for study. These data are allowing geneticists and archaeologists to conduct studies that provide new insights into migration, demographic transitions, and relatedness of ancient individuals. They also afford an entirely new dataset to examine longstanding archaeological questions. While aDNA analysis is having a significant impact on interpretation of the past, due to the very rapid growth and development of the field, archaeologists might find themselves falling behind on increasingly complex methods and numerous publications. Thus, I provide a brief overview on the process of aDNA research. Additionally, this paper addresses some of the recent controversies in aDNA studies, such as ‚Äúsample hoarding,‚Äù the seeming focus on European samples, and ethical issues surrounding aDNA analysis. Finally, while there certainly have been many fruitful collaborations between archaeologists and geneticists, there have also been disagreements about results and data interpretation. I therefore also examine how archaeologists and geneticists can better collaborate in future research.

I found that Tlatelolco and Cholula differ between and within other Central Mexico groups despite the geographic proximity. The genetic distances within Mesoamerican groups suggest a higher genetic diversity in pre-Columbian times. Borderland areas such as Paquime and Greater Nicoya present different haplotypes from the Central Mexico groups which would not support strong migration from highlands in Central Mexico to these areas.

This introductory paper will summarize past and current perceptions of Maya urbanism, emphasizing potentially overshadowed considerations of urban planning, mobility, and community dynamics ‚Äì fundamental cross-cultural features of urbanization ‚Äì and their detection in lowland settlement patterns.
The recent florescence of research deriving insight from urban theory has been positive as it reminds scholars that Maya cities were urban phenomena, not simply political capitals, and must be treated as such. But the trend to emphasize monumentality in urban layout continues, to the near exclusion of other processes critical to urbanization, such as mobility, neighborhood community building, and resource management. There is a strong need for increased residential excavations across Classic urban landscapes, and we should be prepared to develop audacious programs following recent LiDAR surveys. Maya urbanism was a complex mesh of social, economic, ritual, and political networks, balanced between potentially conflicting household and social group loyalties, resulting in changing urban structures through time and space. It will require a long-term disciplinary commitment to household and neighborhood excavations to fully uncover the temporal and regional dynamics of Classic Maya urban systems.",Symposium,Presenter,Damien_Marken,3.75,14,3.75,Th-afternoon

We identify contraction, dispersal and expansion where and when most households units were occupied. We compare these space-time dynamics in epicentral Group B and surrounding urban residential zones, explore their articulation, and discuss possible intra-site population mobility. Although some of the dynamics resulted from royal-court elite attraction and urban planning, the permanence of a dense, post-dynastic occupation, and new housing practices in Group B indicate that people did not need rulers‚Äô coercion to organize and modify their settlement in accordance with what they perceived to be their socioeconomic interests.

These communities possess their own cycles of settlement, florescence, and abandonment. Taken together, these cycles seem to show two distinct aspects that directly pertain to Classic Maya urbanism. One, it shows the urban landscape to be in a continuously changing state. The urban ruins encountered by researchers are the end product of centuries of such shifting settlement and rarely reflect contemporaneous occupation. Two, urban and hinterland communities across the city likely display a variable degree of mobility through time. The El Peru communities described in this paper appear to originate elsewhere and, after abandonment, migrate again. The shifting settlement reflects not just change over time, but mobility, a fundamental dynamic in urban settlement patterns.

The Buenavista Valley, largely controlled during the Classic period by the kingdom of El Zotz, extends out west from the great city of Tikal. However, the Preclassic city of El Palmar preceded this kingdom, established by the first lowland settlers on the western edge of a large wetland. Originally considered a minor site, LiDAR data reveals that El Palmar was in fact a sizeable early community that would have rivaled the emerging kingdom at Tikal. El Palmar was suddenly abandoned between AD 100-200 and a century later, elite settlements emerged on heavily fortified, escarpment edge hilltops.

Was the process of urban transformation a guided, top-down effort guided by a selected group of individuals geared towards the wellbeing of their communities or, can the final city layout be conceived as the sum of a myriad of random, individual decisions taken at the household level without a real centralized planning? Obviously, this is an oversimplification of a much more complex real scenario , nevertheless I consider this simple dichotomy an interesting one, mainly, because it highlights, I think, an important methodological issue: as archaeologists involved in understanding the social logic of ancient Maya urban settings, we should be able to differentiate between urban infrastructure (needed to maintain the necessary minimum conditions for human populations to thrive) and urban programs that aim to satisfy personal agendas (political or ideological in nature) in order to begin a truly comparative study of Maya urbanism and its lessons for contemporary societies.
Using our ongoing investigation in the site of Palenque, Chiapas and by focusing in concepts like: centrality, accessibility, path dependancy, we will discuss some aspects of Palenque urban development and trajectories.

Recently, debate has shifted from largely demographic factors to the design and planning behind Maya urban layouts. While a welcome advance for the field, design theory in the Maya lowlands has often emphasized top-down processes of dynastic intent and meaning within monumental cores, to the near exclusion of bottom-up local, regional, and hinterland processes of settlement and community adaptation, mobility, and interaction in creating the broader low-density urban forms recorded by archaeologists. Maya towns and cities were not only central places resulting from ‚Äúplace-making‚Äù regal policies, but also, and even primarily, were urban entities with their own internal dynamics in relation to their hinterlands.
This session will offer a broadened perspective of Maya urban design and planning, viewing bottom-up and self-organizing processes, such as household decision-making and neighborhood clustering, dispersal/contraction as integral to the development and dissolution of Classic lowland cities. These approaches highlight the flexibility of lowland urban settlements over time and emphasize applying both household and hinterland perspectives to study Classic urban society, including its eventual failure.

This request was motivated by a land exchange proposed to congress which would transfer Oak Flat, Forest Service managed land, to Resolution Copper Mine for purposes of ore extraction.  Four years later on March 4, 2016 the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places officially designated Oak Flat a Traditional Cultural Property (TCP). 
The interim four years would test the fortitude of both the Forest Service and the Tribe, as Resolution Copper and other mining supporters would work creatively and persistently to prevent the formal recognition of Oak Flat as a TCP. Politicians, organizations, and even local tribal members rallied to testify to the falsity of Oak Flat‚Äôs validity as a TCP. Hundreds of letters of objection to the nomination would cause the Forest Service and the Keeper to weigh the cost versus benefits of recognizing the cultural paradigms of the Apache people.

More than twenty-five years have passed since traditional cultural properties were first defined in National Register Bulletin 38 in 1990. Since then, there has been substantial effort in the southwestern United States to develop protocols for identification and management of historic properties whose significance comes from the role they play in the retention and transmission of traditional beliefs and practices. As Patricia L. Parker emphasized, ‚ÄúIt is necessary to try to understand traditional places through the eyes of those who value them.‚Äù Doing this requires collaborative efforts between researchers and traditional communities, and it necessitates new approaches to management and mitigation of adverse effects by federal agencies. Perspectives on current issues in the research and management of traditional cultural properties are presented from people working for tribal, federal, and state agencies, and in the private sector.

",Neolithic,Digital Archaeology,Network Analysis,"Archaeological network research typically relies on material culture similarities over space and time as a proxy for past social networks. In many cases, a range of different types of material culture are subsumed into reconstructed connections between nodes. However, not all forms of material culture are equal. Different types of objects may be caught up in rather different forms of social relationship ‚Äì crudely put, ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô items such as jewellery may perhaps have more social and cultural significance than commodities, for example functional tools - and may thus be traded/exchanged/gifted in different ways. Analyses including different types of material culture may thus conflate multiple different forms of social relationship and patterns of connection. However, ‚Äòsignificant‚Äô and ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô are rarely mutually exclusive categories, and are always fluid, culturally and contextually dependent. This paper will investigate the multiple lenses different forms of material culture provide for studying social networks in the early Neolithic of SW Asia.

Counter to expectations from many contemporary network studies where brokerage positions are associated with long-term advantage, this work instead suggested that broker settlements tended to be small, short-lived, and that brokerage was temporary. This example suggests that the outcomes associated with network position are not strictly determined but that culturally and historically contingent factors can influence how the risks and rewards of network position play out. In this study we take this investigation further by exploring the changing outcomes associated with brokerage positions across a major cultural/historical transition in the northern Southwest. Specifically, we track the relationship between brokerage and settlement trajectories across the rise and fall of the Chaco World (A.D. 800-1250).

",Arctic,Dating Techniques,Network Analysis,"One of the persisting challenges in archaeological network analysis is how to incorporate both temporal and spatial information into network models generated from the archaeological record. This paper tackles this issue by introducing a protocol that places probabilistic weights on potential network connections between archaeological sites, combining time-varying probabilities quantifying contemporaneous site occupation and space-dependent probabilities based on geographic distance. The construction of such network models will be illustrated using radiocarbon data from the Kuril Islands of Northeast Asia. Previous work in this region indicates episodic fluctuations in population density over time, with the breakdown of social networks likely playing a pivotal role in adaptive vulnerability and population decline. By creating a multivariate time series comprising thousands of fine-grained probabilistic networks, we examine long-term trends in network structure in the Kuril archipelago and interpret how these changes relate to demographic transitions. Ultimately, we argue that the data-driven, probabilistic approach to network construction we introduce will better prepare archaeologists to interpret network models across broad temporal scales.",Symposium,Presenter,Erik_Gjesfjeld,3.75,13,3.75,Th-afternoon

I show how food web modeling can help us understand the cascading extinctions of small mammals following the removal of Aboriginal people to outstations in the 1960s.

Although network analysis is concerned with relationships, it has not yet been harnessed to approach the meaning, memory and emotion encoded in our relationships with things and places. We must address this by ensuring that our network analyses incorporate these aspects of lived experience and make meaningful contributions to advancing the archaeological narrative. This paper explores how we might build a methodology for humanised archaeological network analysis in which the lived experiences of people in places and with material culture are considered as an 'entanglement of lines, not a connecting of points' (Ingold 2007: 81). I will focus on the material associated with Syrian cults in the Roman world, using different network approaches at a range of scales in combination to present place as a complex, ongoing result of multiple intertwined networks of experience, emotion, memory, narrative, material and landscape.

",Other,Digital Archaeology: Simulation and Modeling,Communities of Practice,"This paper uses the Nexus 1492 database, built over approximately 30 years of fieldwork, to examine ceramic attribute variability throughout the Antillean Islands. Regional ceramic analyses often focus on the construction of ceramic typologies that are then used to compare typological proportions, differences, and similarities at various spatial resolutions across temporal periods. Long-standing critiques of the use of typologies and taxonomies in archaeology (sensu Brew 1946; Gnecco and Langebaek 2014; Henry et al. 2017; Wylie 1992) focus on the reifying power of their fixed nature. Essentially, typologies become the epistemologies within which we examine the archaeological record, and create the historical narrative. This can become an issue when we also acknowledge that we interpret the past through our modern framework. Thus, in order to more fully separate ourselves from the analysis of the archaeological record, or to decolonize the analysis of archaeological data (sensu Rizvi 2015), we use a networked approach to examine the distribution of ceramic attributes within and between the Antillean Islands. Our goal is to approach a more emic understanding of how communities of practice emerged and to help construct an indigenous social history prior to, and after, the violent arrival of Europeans.",Symposium,Presenter,Lewis_Borck,3.75,13,3.75,Th-afternoon

As methods in network analysis advance, the greatest promise for answering questions about the past lies in the ability to bridge approaches and analyze data from micro- to macro-scales. In this session researchers are encouraged to use network-based approaches to examine archaeological systems through multiple lenses and/or multiple scales, moving beyond reporting statistics such as centrality to interpreting their meaning in light of varied approaches. How can combining social and ecological approaches to networks help illuminate past systems? How do empirical and experimental networks differ, and what does this tell us about the past? How does looking at multiple kinds of networks in the same area help to interpret social changes? How can researchers today use quantitative output from network analysis to interpret the past and produce compelling narratives?

Paediatric hospitals were a consequence of physicians' financial aspirations rather than falsely portrayed ‚Äòcommunity need‚Äô (Lomax, 1998). Their establishment contradicted longstanding attitudes surrounding children as ‚Äòincomplete beings‚Ä¶whom it was wasteful to devote attention to‚Äô (Porter, 1989). Oddly, amputation saw children harness the same attention as adults, and despite being overused, crudely performed with poor survival rates and aftercare, evidence exists of child amputees surviving into adulthood and of child prostheses. This paper will discuss complicated beliefs surrounding paediatric care in nineteenth-century Britain, concentrating on archaeological evidence of prostheses available for juvenile amputees. It asks why, in a society with poor paediatric care, was amputation and prosthesis provisioned for? What sparked the changes to children‚Äôs healthcare which saw institutions such as Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, introduced in 1852? Analysis of Victorian prosthetic devices and medical procedures will help demonstrate that whilst children occupied the role of ‚Äòsociety's future‚Äô, lingering attitudes, contributed to high infant mortality rates, overcrowded workhouses and an enduring class system.

Children are vulnerable individuals and the perinatal and weaning periods are high-risk even under ideal conditions. Investigation of stress during early life is therefore vital to the characterisation of human adaptation in this region. We compared isotopic evidence for infant diet and stress with paleopathological data to assess potential changes in maternal and infant health between the pre-agricultural Archaic Period (9000 ‚Äì 3500 BP) and early agricultural Formative Period (3500-1500 BP). Incremental isotopic analysis (‚àÇN and ‚àÇC) was conducted on 14 individuals. Results show an increase in nitrogen isotope values suggestive of maternal stress during in utero development between the Archaic and Formative Periods. Additionally, 57% of Formative Period children analysed have carbon isotope values consistent with the use of micronutrient-poor maize-based weaning foods, while Archaic period individuals appear to have been weaned onto marine resources. Paleopathological analysis of individuals from the Archaic (N =72) and Formative (N = 115) Periods shows a significant increase (X2 = 6.667; p = .010) in the prevalence of scurvy (vitamin C deficiency), a disease of low dietary diversity.

New incremental isotopic techniques mean that it is now possible to look at individual maternal and infant experiences through tissue chemistry. However, incremental isotopic results are equifinal meaning that multiple interpretations of the data are often possible. This talk will focus on a group (n=5) of incremental isotopic profiles from infants and children from the Inka period site of Camarones 9 in northern Chile. Using these profiles, we will explore how knowledge of the archaeological context, biological factors which may affect isotopic values and consideration of sociocultural theory may allow better interpretation of results.

In this paper, we follow Kamp and propose the use of experimental studies to explore the relation between different social learning strategies and material interactions. We investigated the performances of youth participants making pottery. Three forms of social learning were observed: 1. Participants who made a bowl by copying a pre-made bowl made by the authors, 2. Participants who made a bowl while watching the authors make a bowl, and 3. Participants who made a bowl while the authors made a bowl and described the actions. The results demonstrate patterns of different mental processes, of which caused participants to apply different methods of bowl making. Rather than basing inferences of the past on assumptions of child performance, experimental studies provide a greater opportunity to develop a more concrete understanding of the material indicators that archaeologists identify to assess child performance. These questions help enhance our understanding of childcare practices and the roles of childhood agents in broader social milieus.

To support this rapidly growing industrial city, services like railways and gasworks were constructed around the city perimeter, along with housing, shops, and other services and institutions. Neighbourhoods like the industrial colony of Parkwood Springs were home to long term residents, and a growing population of families. The city authorities became concerned with the formal education of these children of the industrial city, children of the 'labouring poor'. Built initially for the children ‚Äì boys, girls, and infants ‚Äì of men employed in the metal trades, the Neepsend School near Parkwood Springs attracted subscribers from across the city, as well as from within Parkwood itself. The school‚Äôs situation, amongst the works of Neepsend, firmly embedded the children‚Äôs education within the industrial cityscape. As an institution for the care as well as education, the building was carefully spatially divided and managed, communicating social behaviour as well as industrial training. Employing standing building survey, GIS, and archival research, this paper will examine the site of Neepsend School.

Results indicate there are three situations where feeding practices and health interact: first, the mother‚Äôs ability to meet nutritional demands of infants during prolonged breastfeeding; second, undernutrition due to a health insult when the child is losing passive immunity; third, children being weaned on foods lacking protein quality and content when they may already be undernourished.

It requires their physical, cultural and social needs to be met, and for children to become, through their own practice, social agents. The papers in this session will address each of these stages of childcare, drawing on evidence from biological anthropology, material culture, the built environment, ritual contexts and experimental approaches. The papers will enable us to explore the similarities and culturally constructed differences in the ways in which communities and families care for their children, and provide opportunities for them to become social actors.

In honor of his retirement, we review how animals are depicted in Precontact rock art sites from the region he knew so well.  A wide variety of creatures‚Äîmammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and even insects‚Äîwere illustrated by ancient southeastern artists.  Animal imagery appears in both open air and cave art, although the kinds of animals vary between these two contexts.  The animals used most intensively for food, however, were less commonly drawn on rock and cave walls.   Animals that were depicted most often were those who could cross between land and water, from the air to the ground, or from the surface to subterranean worlds.

",Historic,Zooarchaeology,Subsistence and Foodways,"Historic records indicate that during the late 18th and into the 19th century preserved North Atlantic fishes were shipped to the West Indies as a relatively cheap source of protein to feed enslaved persons and also the planter class. However, in historic zooarchaeological analyses of faunal assemblages from the Caribbean, the presence of these food remains are often not identified. Using two sites from the Danish West Indies, a case will be made for the use of fine-screen techniques to ensure adequate recovery of these remains to provide a more complete dietary picture and definitive evidence of provisioning. Additional faunal data show a predominance of marine fish and mollusk remains and limited use of domestic species.

Within this context one species has become significant, the bison of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.  Recent expansion of the population, and ist subsequent migration outside federal lands, has created concern among federal managers, local ranchers, and conservation groups.  However, much of what is known about pre-management herds Is based on historic records and modern studies.  While both are invaluable sources, they have limitations.  For example, historic studies are often anecdotal and modern studies are based largely on small, isolated herds.  The purpose of my research is to develop a longer-term historical perspective on the mammalian community of the GYE.  The lack of knowledge of the mammalian community is notable considering all that is known about the glacial, climate, and vegetative history.  An initial step in this research is the study of bison ecology through the application of stable isotope signatures (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and strontium) derived from discrete downtooth samples of modern and prehistoric bison.

We report extensive bone damage due to feeding of the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), a close relative of termites. Roaches were seen feeding on thawing vertebrate remains in a processing room, in which skeletons were being prepared for entry into a comparative collection. A study of roach gnawing was initiated after a number of defleshed mammal bones were discovered extensively modified. Six human skeletons that were similarly processed in a neighboring suite were also surveyed for insect damage. Gnaw marks were examined under a stereomicroscope using 10-40x magnification. A feeding experiment with housed roaches demonstrated this insect‚Äôs ability to modify bone. Locations of extensive roach feeding appeared superficially similar to small rodent gnawing, but the two agents were clearly separable under low magnification. Roach mandibular scrapings and their patterns were similar to those previously reported for termites.

Former and current students and colleagues cover a broad range of topics inspired by Klippel‚Äôs interests in zooarchaeology and archaeology, including animal induced taphonomy, subsistence practices, morphological and range changes in species over time, species identifications, and allometry.

It is composed by 14 structures, or huacas, distributed in an area of 47 hectares, in a rural place named Chuquitanta. The site is recognized as one of the earliest expressions of monumental architecture and social complexity in Peru since the works of Fr√©d√©ric Engel in the 1960‚Äôs and Jeffrey Quilter in the 1980‚Äôs. Since 2015, the Peruvian Ministry of Culture is developing a project of investigation, conservation and restauration of the site. This presentation explains the results of the first two years of the project. So far, we developed excavations in architectonics I, III, IV, VI, and IX, defining the constructive phases of those buildings, and recovering evidences of an economy based on agriculture production complemented with the exploitations for marine and riverine resources. Also, offerings chambers were discovered with especial artifacts like slings, lithic clubs, digging sticks, a cactus, and the burial of a young women.

At the beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C., at least 30 large, sedentary agricultural settlements with monumental architecture appeared between the Huaura and Fortaleza river valleys in a region known locally as the ‚ÄúNorte Chico‚Äù (‚ÄúLittle North‚Äù). Since the publication of Moseley‚Äôs The Foundations of Maritime Civilizations (1975), the north central coast of Peru has been viewed as an exceptional case in global prehistory. Although this precocious development has been a subject of study since that time, research has focused almost exclusively at the site-level. Such a narrow focus has obscured the analytical value of the Norte Chico region as a regional phenomenon. By adopting a broader perspective, I will demonstrate what the Late Preceramic cultural landscape of the Norte Chico region can tell us about social interaction, power relations, and cultural complexity.",Symposium,Presenter,Matthew_Piscitelli,2.75,10,2.75,Th-afternoon

Huaca Negra is a fishing village locates in the northwest of the Vir√∫ Valley and is 1.2 kilometers from the current shoreline. The site was occupied between 5,000-3,200 CalBP, from Late Preceramic Period to Initial Period, which witnessed the transitions from non-sedentary activity to a settled village, from sedentism to the construction of the mound, and finally from the usage to the abandonment of the mound. 
Along with these social changes, the long-term occupation provides a unique opportunity to study early coastal life. The comparison of four activities (fishing, shellfish collecting, hunting, and planting) and its diachronic change help to reveal the nature of subsistence system in both Late Preceramic and Initial Period. The preferred catchment zones, change of coping strategy and the implication of social change will also be addressed.

The superposition of many temples (ritual chambers) suggests that there were repeated architectural renovation events during the Late Preceramic occupation referred to as the Kotosh Mito Phase.  However, the chronological position of the Kotosh Mito Phase has been uncertain because the deepest level of the mound was left unexcavated to preserve its important cultural heritage features such as the Templo de las Manos Cruzadas. Furthermore, the intensive alteration by the Early Horizon occupation made the architectural transition from the Preceramic Period to the Initial Period unclear.  The authors will present new data from excavations in 2016 of the same mound , aiming to elucidate the complete process of renovation of temples during the Kotosh Mito Phase.

These practices are constituted by various mortuary contexts and are particularly noted for their use of architectural reconstruction, an activity repeated from around 4000 cal. BC ~1900 cal. BC divided into two phases, the CV-1 phase and the CV-2 phase. We conducted a stratigraphic examination of these contexts, and carried out radio carbon dating to further analyze the processes of constructing mound and its change over time. These analyses revealed that accumulation of food waste midden and embedded mortuary contexts caused the growing of mound volume in the CV-1 phase, and the abruptly change to the beginning of architecture construction on the mound: an activity of constructing a room and the reconstructions of floors and walls which led to the division of inside space in the CV-2 phase. These processes indicate that the monumentality of mounds gradually increased in the CV-1 phase as the mortuary and food waste accumulating practice, and the increased monumentality caused the change of the utilization of this place around 2800 cal. BC, in the CV-2 phase.",Symposium,Presenter,KAZUHO_SHOJI,2.75,10,2.75,Th-afternoon
