the humboldt river was a significant transportation route used for the movement of information, goods, and people from prehistoric through modern times. continual use of the river as a transportation node is due to its west-southwest direction, which provides one of the few natural corridors across the great basin. because of the relatively flat topography, the central pacific railroad company, motivated by the ideals of nationalism and capitalism, built their line along the humboldt river corridor. documenting the location and condition of the central pacific railroad (cprr) is critical to preserving and protecting this historically significant resource. however, the cprr, including its associated features and artifacts, is more than a historic scar on the landscape; it is a clue to the social, economic, and political conditions of the late nineteenth century. many of these historic situations can be examined from an archaeological perspective through landscape analysis. as one of the last large-scale construction projects completed by manual labor in the united states, archaeological studies of the central pacific also provides details on the lives of groups marginalized by history, including the chinese laborers who worked on the line.
