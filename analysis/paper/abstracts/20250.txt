recent excavations at a number of intermediate-sized mounds of the initial period (2100-1000 b.c.) site of taukachi-konkán in the casma valley of peru have uncovered surprising new evidence of clay friezes and architectural forms previously unknown for the initial period along the coast of peru. one u-shaped mound complex has an associated sunken rectangular plaza that contains distinct friezes on all four of its sides. the content of the friezes includes two sea lions, a large feline and two possible avian beings that most likely reflect the cosmology of the builders of the site. the mound itself has an asymmetrical access pattern that is unique among initial period mounds that normally have symmetrical layouts and direct access routes. architecture on the north wing structure housed ritual activities as well as living quarters for personnel who maintained the ritual mound complex.
