artistic objects are thought to be one of the hallmarks of the natufian period, marking a florescence of artistic behavior appearing prior to the origins of agriculture. however, with continuing research into early and middle epipalaeolithic sites in the levant, new discoveries of ‘symbolic’ artifacts are increasing our understanding of even earlier artistic and symbolic pursuits. in this paper we present an engraved plaquette from the middle epipalaeolithic context of kharaneh iv, eastern jordan. using white-light confocal microscopy, we analyze manufacturing traces to identify the gestures and tools used to create the plaquette. this artifact, although the only engraved piece recovered from kharaneh iv thus far, links into wider networks of epipalaeolithic interaction and cultural exchange. placing the kharaneh iv engraved object into regional context with other early/middle epipalaeolithic artistic artifacts, we explore wider networks of interaction prior to the natufian.
