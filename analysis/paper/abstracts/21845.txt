previous archaeological investigations of terminus groups in the maya lowlands concluded that these architectural complexes served either cosmological, ritual, or economic purposes.  in an effort to test these models, we investigated causeway terminus groups at cahal pech and baking pot.  subsequent comparisons of the cahal pech and baking pot data with that from other sites in the belize valley, caracol and tikal, strongly suggest that while there was some regional diversity in the significance of these architectural complexes, their primary role was likely to produce ideological messages that politically and ritually connected hinterland communities with their site cores.
