human sacrifice in the sixteenth-century aztec empire, as recorded by spanish chroniclers, was conducted on a large scale and was usually the climactic ritual act culminating elaborate multi-day festivals. scholars have advanced a wide range of theories explaining the underlying motivations and purposes of these abundant and regulated ritual massacres. as an extension of recent efforts that examine ancient aztec sacrifice as a multi-faceted and complex system, this paper utilizes a phenomenological approach to examine the “experience” of sacrificial rituals. using modern bio-social-psychological theory, this paper reveals that the brutal treatment of captive enemy bodies in human sacrificial rituals provided physiological, psychological, and social rewards that turned these spectacular events into a form of enthralling entertainment. several other recompenses for officiants and other spectator-participants included a sense of security, management of anxiety, and social bonding. in addition, this paper reveals that these ceremonies incorporated different shamanic elements that fostered communally experienced “altered states of consciousness” which further contributed to physiological rewards, the reduction of social anxieties, and an increase in social solidarity. the significance of this investigation is that it offers additional explanations for the massive scale and longevity of the practice of human sacrifice amongst the ancient aztec.
