in 2003, a master’s thesis project examined a multicomponent navajo habitation site dating to the 17th-18th centuries in the dinétah region of northwest new mexico. the initial survey program carried out a number of activities, including site mapping, surface collection, and artifact analyses; however, certain questions were left unanswered. a new phase of research initiated in the summer of 2017 aims to better characterize the site and explore the possibility of a pastoral adaptation on the part of the site’s diné inhabitants. this talk presents several findings from this new investigation alongside a detailed reanalysis of the ceramic and lithic assemblages collected in 2003.
