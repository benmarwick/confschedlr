this presentation aims to discuss public archaeology (pa) from a brazilian approach. based on a study that includes a bibliographical survey, and the analysis of the papers presented at scientific meetings in brazil, i examined: a) the role of pa in the contemporary agenda of the archaeology in brazil; b) the connections between pa, heritage education (he), and the development projects, and c) its relationship with the decolonizing perspective of the discipline in latin america.  in addition, i also recognize gender issues in the domains of pa in the country, which is mostly linked to women, either as authors of academic literature or as coordinators of events, actions, and projects of pa (or he). finally, i critically analyze my own work within public archaeology in amazon. such questions have made me reflect  about the concepts and goals that legitimate the category “public archaeology”.
