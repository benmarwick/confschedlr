In such contexts, ethnic identities, constructed around concepts of blood, race, language, or locality, are important for achieving cooperation because they heighten trust that group members are willing to comply with the costs associated with collective action. Members “signal” their ethnicity and, thereby their commitment to costly moral values associated with cooperation by consuming ethnically appropriate material culture, speaking local dialects, and participating in community rituals. However, when such regions shift toward more centralized administration, multiethnic landscapes appear to pose impediments to achieving collective action at larger spatial scales. In such cases, larger more inclusive identifies are hypothesized to be an important ingredient in overcoming inter-community distrust and the unwillingness of individuals with local identities to collectively bare the costs of regional public goods and/or collective defense.

However, a growing body of scholarship on the material culture of such incorporated societies shows that the nature of their relationship with the Empire was variable, and that Inka control was not territorially continuous. One key strategy through which the Inka incorporated these groups was the entangling and capture of their local religious practices with those of the official state cult. In this paper, I propose to flip this model and ask how local polities interpreted the Inka within their own memory and history. In other words, what were the narratives that some of these polities spanned to define their own standing within the Empire? I focus on the Yauyos people from the highlands of Lima, Peru. Through and archaeological and historical analysis, I argue that local rituals and spaces served as the critical medium through which the Yauyos defined their own interpretation of the Inka and their new position within their empire, thinking of themselves as allies as of the Inka as subjected to their own local deities.",Symposium,Presenter,Carla_Hernandez Garavito,3.5,13,3.5,Sa-morning

While imperial influence spread rapidly and thoroughly throughout the central valleys, Tlaxcallan appears as a rift in imperial control, resisting the encircling empire. Aztec narratives relegate Tlaxcallan to the peripheries, downplaying Tlaxcaltecas as one-dimensional barbaric enemies, unconquered by choice. In contrast, ethnohistoric accounts from within Tlaxcallan emphasize a state that intentionally separated itself from the Aztecs in ideology, social organization, and political and economic alliances, actively challenging the encroaching empire. For both groups, rising political tensions at the end of the Postclassic served as a catalyst for specific constructions of identity, demonstrating the political value of an image of cohesion. While these identities are often portrayed as fixed, this presentation will analyze human skeletal remains excavated from the urban center of Tepeticpac, Tlaxcallan to explore how the body serves both as a point of state defined identity, while also capturing lived experiences that depart from controlled social and political categories.

These narratives are the product of the history of Inca interactions from initial contact and conquest through the subsequent impacts of colonization, Inca civil war, and Spanish conquest, and they present attitudes toward those groups that range from indifference (Paltas) or scorn (Punaes) to respect (Cañaris). How the Incas treated these groups had impacts on how their ethnic identities were transformed or maintained during the Inca and Spanish Colonial eras, and show a pattern of consolidation of numerous smaller, related groups.

While the Spanish chronicles and local ethnohistoric sources attest to these events and to the important role the local indigenous populations played in Inka colonization efforts along the eastern imperial frontier, they are all curiously silent on another important population which inhabited the eastern Andean valleys into the Inka period. Abundant archaeological evidence from the Inka site of Pulquina Arriba and surrounding settlements demonstrates that the earliest settlers of this region had arrived not from the altiplano, but instead from the eastern tropical lowlands. Further, instead of being administered by Inka elites, Pulquina Arriba seems to have been inhabited by a combination of Charkas- and lowland-affiliated peoples. As such, this seems to represent a case in which a historically unacknowledged indigenous population was nevertheless critical to the success of imperial activities and administration in a critical frontier region.

Nearly a century later, a second wave of erasures occurred when Spanish conquerors destroyed indigenous books and idols in an effort to eradicate blasphemous religious beliefs. Although indigenous accounts were eventually rewritten, largely at the hands of Spanish-educated indigenous elites, the diverse histories from Basin of Mexico polities that pre-dated the formation of the Aztec Empire remained lost. Only recently have archaeological investigations begun to demonstrate the diversity that characterized the Postclassic Basin of Mexico.

For example, alliances, arranged marriages and ritual performances served to consolidate internal diversity and manage external challenges to the imperial façade. The historical record (a largely imperial perspective) often portrays encountered polities in subservient ways - as allies, as belligerent, as barbaric, or as the “other”. Yet, empires were invariably constrained by the actions of competing and incorporated polities, who complicated the imperial narratives through their conscious or inadvertent engagements with the empire.The papers in this session center on material evidence from recent archaeological research to challenge historical imperial narratives, and explore the spectrum of imperial influence in local material cultural expression. Specifically, we look at the Inka in the Central Andes and the Aztec in Mesoamerica.

Ball spent a highly successful and influential career identifying archaeological insights into the Maya through detailed, rigorous, and creative ceramic analyses. In honor of his many contributions, this paper draws on Dr. Ball’s methodological and theoretical approaches by using ceramics as a springboard for deeper anthropological discussions into daily life at Jamestown Island, Virginia during the first half century of English settlement (1607-1657). Distinctions in artifact frequencies between Fort-Period and Post-Fort Period features uncovered by members of the ongoing Jamestown Rediscovery Project are consistent throughout nearly every artifact type are most pronounced among ceramics. Expanding the analysis from a core dimensional focus on space, time, and form to broader thematic issues of diachronic trade patterns and intercultural exchange laterality, this presentation identifies key nuances in exchange directionality and economic inequity that reflected the deterioration of English/Powhatan Indian relations during the first quarter of the 17th century.

What is the point of analyzing hundreds and thousands of small, broken pieces of pottery?  This paper explores these, and other questions, within the context of Classic Maya civilization.  Too often, it seems, ceramic analysis is used as a loose chronological framework, used solely to construct broad frameworks of relative dating.  These frameworks are then applied to archaeological assemblages, placing them within chronologically bounded “ceramic complexes” and geographically bounded “ceramic spheres.”  Then most ceramic analyses end.  This paper argues that this is the point where real ceramic analysis should begin.  Ceramic complexes should be broken down into distinct centuries and even individual decades, if possible.  Ceramic analysis can be used to create absolute chronologies.  Ceramic spheres can be subdivided, revealing the exchange of material culture between individual cities, communities, and households.  Thus, ceramic analysis can shed significant light on cultural, social, economic, and political ties on such material exchanges.

Research suggests that a “middle” status group exists. However, the social segment from which they arise is unknown. This study focuses on individuals from the urban center of Buenavista del Cayo who are below the ruling elites in the “middle” rungs of social status, and those from the neighboring farming community of Guerra who are recognized as nonelites. Previous research suggested that no biological affinity existed between the ruling elite and the “middle” status groups. Thus, we hypothesized that there would be a biological connection between the “middle” status group and the nonelites at these sites. Our study used a bio-cultural approach to interpret social connections by comparing dental characteristics (crown size and trait expression) and archaeological evidence to assess whether there was biological affinity between these two social groups. Our results indicate that there was shared affinity, suggesting that middle status individuals maintained biological and cultural ties with the nonelite group.

Ball,Mesoamerica: Maya lowlands,Maya: Preclassic,Ceramic Analysis,Chronology,"Seminal and persistently relevant work by Ball has shaped and reshaped our understanding of Middle to Late Preclassic population movements on the Yucatan Peninsula and the establishment of local potting communities and traditions. Evidence of Middle Preclassic ceramic production in the northeastern-most Maya Lowlands had remained elusive until the mid 1990s. Early Nabanche affinities observed in the locally produced pottery of northern Quintana Roo suggested an expansion of peoples across the northern plains by the mid 7th century BC. Initial movements of populations from the eastern Petén and northern Belize were assumed to be coeval with the appearance of Chicanel Horizon assemblages in the northeast of the Peninsula However, ongoing research in northernmost Quintana Roo suggests an introduction of the southeastern lowland Mamom tradition at a time earlier than Yucatecan influences from the west. Interestingly, recent excavations in Yucatan have revealed pre-Mamom pottery that may similarly reflect a “heterogenic homogeneity” described by Ball, whereby these earliest of types represent emerging yet distinctive regional traditions with deep ties to the south.

In this paper, we present new data to examine one research question studied by Joseph Ball and Jennifer Taschek:  Classic Maya political dynamics in the Mopan Valley of western Belize.  This valley was home to five large centers, spaced 1 to 5 km apart:  Las Ruinas de Arenal, Early Xunantunich, Classic Xunantunich, Actuncan, and Buenavista del Cayo.  Ball and Taschek conducted extensive fieldwork at Buenavista and Arenal, and they proposed a model of the valley’s political structure as comprising a single polity with functionally distinct settlements. Following in their footsteps, we have conducted research at all of the sites listed above.  We present new archaeological and epigraphic that allow for a more nuanced model of the valley’s political organization.

Here we aspire to his bottom-up, material culture approach to interpretation in recent collaborative research in the western Peten and the southern “frontier” of the Classic Maya states. His emphasis on lab-driven research, detailed ceramic analyses and fine-grained chronologies and a “direct” style is shamelessly mimicked here, first to briefly criticize serious flaws in recent studies of economy, dynastic collapse, and other aspects of Classic Maya societies and social change.  However, then we build positively on detailed ceramic classification, statistical study, chronology, and compositional analyses to reconstruct economic systems on a more solid, controlled data base. Those “ceramically-grounded” studies have revealed strengths and weaknesses in southern lowland political economies, ingenious attempts to adapt them to a changing Mesoamerican world, and reasons for the failure of those brilliant innovations.

Ball’s work has led to a nuanced crystallization and use of a shared ceramic lexicon among Maya archaeologists. The larger impact of his scholarship, however, is seen in his broad syntheses of Maya culture history and his explicitly anthropological approach to archaeology. Through his work, for example, great strides were made in achieving a deeper understanding of Preclassic cultures and ethnicity in the northern and central Maya lowlands, particularly in the Belize Valley. Ball also developed the chronological framework for the Yucatan and introduced the conceptual structure for the segmentary state.

Research suggests the pecuniary instability of the Belize Valley was the result of a semiautonomous existence where interactions with neighboring dominant centers led to episodic subjugation.

Previous experimental attempts at photogrammetry at Pacbitun were implemented in an ad-hoc manner to serve as a proof of concept for the inclusion of 3D photogrammetry in the program of research at Pacbitun. Spatial control of the acquired models was similarly ad hoc, utilizing the tools available at that time. The resultant 3D models from the 2015 and 2016 campaigns have proven a highly effective tool for the visualization of excavations conducted during those field seasons.  
This presentation marks the maturation of 3D photogrammetry at Pacbitun. The integration of 3D data with differential GPS positional data allows for data processed using photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques to be integrated into existing GIS data. By acquiring images in a rule-based manner, the overall number of images can be optimized to balance between number of images needed and photogrammetric coverage. Reducing the overall number of images while maximizing coverage will allow for models to be produced more efficiently, and with great overall accuracy. Improved spatial control, updated software and enhanced image acquisition techniques have allowed photogrammetry at Pacbitun to mature from an experiment to a critical recordation tool.

This group, designated as the Tzib Group, was targeted because one of the mounds, labelled Mano Mound, yielded numerous mano fragments on its surface. Intensive investigations at Mano Mound revealed a production loci, namely the manufacture of manos made from granite, dating to the Late Classic (600-800 CE) period. Systematic survey immediately around the Tzib Group has produced numerous other small groups of mounds also engaged in mano production. Until the summer of 2017 we believed that this mano producing community was limited to the northwest periphery of the site core.

",Maya: Classic,Paleoethnobotany,Material Culture and Technology,"Material culture studies allow archaeologists to examine the social implications of the physical world in which people are embedded. Sacred landscapes, for example, inspire social narratives regarding how people should interact with the environment. Components of those landscapes, such as caves and mountains, become active participants in the establishment, maintenance, and mobilization of environmental narratives. They serve as hegemonic tools for conveying morality and proper behavior, and as such they are prone to appropriation by those in power. Using archaeological data from the Maya site of Pacbitun, this paper seeks to understand how materialized narratives are part of broader networks of power used to reinforce and challenge dominant hegemony. The presence of elite-sponsored constructions near caves act as overt manifestations of environmental narratives seeking to situate the community as a unified whole.

Throughout those twenty years, many partnerships were made with academia and federal agencies. However many challenges were encountered during the NAGPRA process. These challenges provided unexpected hurtles and trials for the Claimant Tribes in their fight for a cultural affiliation determination with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

The range of challenges the Claimant Tribes faced and continue to struggle with encompass: demonstrating a continuous, documented history dating from 9000 years ago to present, absence of  artifacts and analysis data from Columbia Plateau collections, maintaining collaborative and inclusive relationships between researchers and Tribes, conducting meaningful consultation, and ethical interpretations of NAGPRA. From a tribal perspective, the challenges can be overcome but will require outreach, training, research, ethical guidance, development of guidance documents, and possible legislative changes to NAGPRA’s inadvertent discovery regulations.

Evidence demonstrating the Cultural Affiliation of the Ancient One to the Claimant Tribes can be found within the disciplines of indigenous knowledge, geography, biology, archaeology, anthropology, linguistics, folklore, oral tradition, and historical data.  The totality of all evidence demonstrates cultural persistence and adaptive change resulting in the continuum of culture and kinship within Plateau peoples.  
The evidence clearly indicates the indigenous people of the Columbia Plateau adapted to changing spatial and temporal landscape over millennia.  These adaptations encompass the cultural affiliation with the Ancient One’s remains.  By virtue of a shared group identity directly connected to places, resources, and people within the geographical context of a cultural landscape affiliation always was certain.

Their identities are complex and can include their status as elders and survivors, as well as their roles as individuals and explorers.

Yet their urbanization process remains poorly understood. Our research over the last six field seasons indicates that some residential groups were settled at Tlalancaleca towards 800 BC and the settlement was urbanized with a significant population growth during the later Middle Formative period (ca. 650-500 BC); the city experienced large-scale urban transformations during the Late Formative (ca. 500-100 BC) and a subsequent and final urban expansion during the Terminal Formative (ca. 100 BC-AD 250). Tlalancaleca’s long occupational history overlaps with that of Chalcatzingo as well as Teotihuacan and, thus, provides a unique opportunity to address long-term social transformations during the Formative period. Based on preliminary results of our research at Tlalancaleca, we will reconsider the trajectory of urban transformations in Central Mexico over 1000 years from the Middle Formative to the Terminal Formative/Early Classic periods and discuss its implications for understanding parallel and divergent trajectories of social transformation in later Formative Mesoamerica.",Symposium,Presenter,Tatsuya_Murakami,4,16,4,Sa-morning

In previous papers, I have presented stylistic evidence for interaction between La Consentida and potters from distant West Mexican traditions such as Capacha and Opeño. While some of La Consentida’s decorated Tlacuache phase vessels suggest involvement in a system of long-distance interaction along Mesoamerica’s Pacific coast, more utilitarian wares such as globular jars and undecorated hemispherical bowls imply affiliations closer to home, specifically with Early Formative period highland assemblages of the Espiridión, Tierras Largas, and Purrón phases. In this paper, I discuss formal similarities between highland pottery and La Consentida’s Tlacuache phase assemblage. On the basis of these affiliations, I propose a model in which La Consentida’s diverse ceramics are explained as partly the result of the cooperating or even conflicting emphases of overlapping interaction spheres: one along the Pacific coast and one tying the coast to the southern and central Mesoamerican highlands. These patterns suggest that people at La Consentida both maintained some traditional practices of Red-on-Buff potters in adjacent regions and self-consciously participated in a coastal interaction network involving more superficial decorative styles.",Symposium,Presenter,Guy_Hepp,4,16,4,Sa-morning

This paper presents preliminary results of excavations, which were carried at monumental structures at Tlalancaleca. It examines the construction techniques used for monument building (including talud-tablero facades), the degree of urban planning, and the temporal relationship between monumental construction and the urban development based on new radiocarbon dates. Preliminary analysis suggests that monumental construction and reconstruction was heightened during the Terminal Formative period and was associated with urban expansion after the eruption of Popocatepetl around AD 50. While there was no central avenue at Tlalancaleca, we have noted a certain degree of standardization of main axes for monumental building. Such a standardization suggests the integrated nature of several monumental complexes.

The decades before our era underwent both socio-spatial reconfigurations, probably due to rapid environmental change in the principal cultural epicenter, the valley of Acambaro, which was massively depopulated.

The recent works carried out in two zones of the Lerma region, the valley of Acambaro itself, and the alluvial plain of Lerma some 100 km downstream, lead to revisit the current assumptions on the directions of population movements that signal the end of Chupicuaro and which mark the beginning of new processes embodied by Protoclassic societies in north-central Mexico.

While we do not imply that the presence or absence of certain ceramic traditions serves as direct indicators for political control, it is likely that Tlalancaleca formed part of important interaction spheres along with other areas such as the Morelos region, the Tehuacan Valley, the Basin of Mexico, and more lately with the Valley of Teotihuacan. Some ceramics resembling those from the Patlachique-Tzacualli tradition at Teotihuacan, which were formerly seen as foreign and brought after the abandonment of Tlalancaleca around 100 A.D., have been obtained from secure contexts in recent excavations of monumental architecture at Tlalancaleca.

As death is the most crucial instance that both signals closure and new beginnings, today, as in the past, funerals often include libations. In the village of Tetimpa, some beverage was fitting for the last journey, since several of over a hundred burials have goblets. Their content is unknown, but as each house had, besides ollas for water, amphorae similar to those later used in Cholula for pulque, it might have been this or another fermented brew.

The study of human mobility is key to understanding the social and cultural dynamics of the pre-Columbian groups that inhabited northern Chile’s Atacama Desert. Material culture suggests that during the Late Intermediate Period (AD 900-1450) individuals frequently crossed the desert from the coast to the Andes and vice versa. Fish remains have been found in the interior valleys, and inland textiles and crops at the coast. This paper explores mobility in northern Chile through the application of strontium and oxygen isotope analyses on human teeth from several archaeological sites. First we present a local bioavailable strontium baseline for the study area, based on plant and animal remains, which helps to alleviate the scarcity of bio-available strontium isotope data for northern Chile. Results show that non-local individuals of both sexes were buried in the dispersed cemeteries of Pica 8, Quitor 6 and Los Verdes 1. These results support the idea that varied groups of individuals moved across the landscape, complementing and augmenting the larger discussion on mobility patterns in the Atacama Desert.

This previous work suggested that the complex dates to the Early Formative Period, implying contemporaneity with local sites including Las Haldas, Sechín Bajo, Cerro Sechín, and Sechín Alto. However, the occupational history of Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke is considerably more complex than what was originally proposed. New data contribute to explanations of the construction sequence, settlement planning, use of the natural setting, and the reasoning for the selection of the complex’s physical placement, particularly in political and economic terms. As such, construction of Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke began in the end of the Late Archaic and was subject to modifications according to the social transformations occurring with the introduction of ceramics and the Chavín phenomenon. In turn, its ruling class would have dominated the socio-political scene in the middle Casma Valley.",Symposium,Presenter,Augusto_Bazan Perez,3,11,3,Sa-morning

This is mainly due to its strategic location within Andean geography as an enclave of natural points of access to different ecological zones (coastal valleys, Amazon rainforest, southern highlands). Cajamarca culture (100 BC - 1400 AD) is characterized precisely by the mobility of its inhabitants, as indicated by their white pottery—a result of the use of the kaolinitic clay found in its mountains. Although we know much about this contact from the remains left outside its borders, we know little about cultural motivations and dynamics that took place in Cajamarca and what drove these people to move outside. Here, I will focus on two key points about the nature of this culture: its possible malleability in adapting to different ecological zones due commercial activity, and second, given its nomadic nature through the landscape, the way in which characteristic Cajamarca ceramic style was used as its seal of ""denomination of origin"", and as a reminder of identity or political affiliation to the Cajamarca group.",Symposium,Presenter,Solsiré_Cusicanqui,3,11,3,Sa-morning

This is especially true for the Andes, where the “thorny oyster” has been found far afield from its tropical breeding sites along the coasts of Ecuador and northern Peru. However, factors such as the uneven development of archaeology between Peru and Ecuador and the persistence of certain myths about Andean Spondylus have led to a “black-boxing” effect where exchange from Ecuador to Peru is assumed rather than tested.
This paper briefly presents the state of understanding in Andean Spondylus, as relates to: its exploitation by ancient people; its exchange through the coast, highlands, and jungle; its production into remarkable artifacts of beauty and importance; and its cosmological significance for numerous Andean societies. This review highlights the potential impact of developing techniques to source Spondylus shells from their coastal Ecuadorian and Peruvian breeding grounds on the study of the ancient Andes. The paper will present preliminary results of archaeometric sourcing efforts, the difficulties of extending this technique into the Andean paleoclimate, and the implications of defining the sources of Spondylus for exchange in the ancient Northern and Central Andes.",Symposium,Presenter,Corey_Herrmann,3,11,3,Sa-morning

Camelids not only help pastoralists mitigate risk by acting as literal “wealth on the hoof,” but they also maintain cohesion of intergroup relationships across vast distances by facilitating mobility within and among diverse environmental zones. Here, I examine intensified camelid pastoral systems as an adaptation to scarcity in the Andean highlands. I employ a multiproxy analysis including zooarchaeology, microbotany, and stable isotopes to examine the extent to which intensified pastoralism was key in proliferating the widespread cultural phenomena we see in the highlands at approximately 1000BC in the Central Andes.

Do they speak to the how citizens of the new republic saw themselves or what they aspired for others to see?

To an untrained eye, the built environment of a typical city block may look like an unlikely place to find archaeological remains but to an archaeologist it is a time capsule waiting to be opened. To this end, urban archaeology often requires peeking beneath parking lots, which often provide temporary protection to buried resources until the land is slated for development. The changing dynamics of an evolving city may mean that beneath the parking lot archaeological resources are buried beneath extensive fill deposits. Conversely, they may have been destroyed by extensive grading. Consulting historic maps, conducting elevation change analyses, and conducting geophysical testing can provide an idea of what is buried below, but ultimately excavation is required to determine what survives.

Archaeology fieldwork concluded in the summer of the 2017, and involved remote sensing and the excavation of six test units.

From an archaeological perspective, this may be directly through data, improved models of human adaptation, building or preserving modern connections to place, to name a few. However, to date these have not been well-incorporated into federal efforts to address climate change, largely as a result of a lack of systematic engagement. To address this gap for archaeology and other social sciences, in 2016 the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) undertook an effort to engage four underrepresented social science disciplines to support preparation of the fourth US National Climate Assessment and other ongoing federal work. This paper presents the experiences of three archaeologists and one anthropologist involved in this project and an assessment of what worked, what was a challenge, and recommendations for improving the art of connecting study of the past to actionable government results for global climate change.

The site has occupation dating to the Archaic Period as well as the Middle Preclassic through the Early Postclassic. Pollen and geomorphologic evidence suggest intensive forest clearance, wetland soil manipulation, swamp margin, and upland manipulation dating as early as the Archaic Period. Evidence for intensive blade production coincides with pollen evidence from Cobweb Swamp for economic species such as maize and manioc. 
     During the Archaic Period, a warmer, wetter environment jumpstarts an archaeologically visible trend in cultivation and domestication. Mesoamerica’s biologically diverse landscape had much to offer its early revolutionary inhabitants. Research involving the cultural transition from complex hunter-gatherers to agriculturalists supports evidence that the early inhabitants of Colha can be studied as a regional model to understand their larger role during the commencement of the Maya civilization.

Such palimpsests become potent, which, in the case of mortuary landscapes, can manifest in increasingly complex burial rituals through time. The 2017 excavations at Colha revealed a series of 9 interments in the main plaza of the 2000 sector, yielding a minimum number of 13 individuals. This mortuary area initially utilized during the Middle Preclassic was reused during the Late Preclassic, with some later interments cutting into those of the preceding period, as suggested by associated practices and material accoutrements. Zooarchaeological evidence indicates that although certain taxa, including deer, were exploited throughout the entire temporal span, others, specifically ichthyofauna, are characteristic of Late Classic mortuary contexts. The placement of elements from this taxonomic group within vessel burials alongside commingled human individuals is associated with the elaboration of mortuary practices more broadly, which includes complex secondary depositions and increasingly specialized craft production of grave goods.

Previous investigations demonstrate a long occupational history at the site that spans from the Late Archaic (ca. 3400 BC) to the Early Postclassic (AD 1200). Building upon previous research, a primary goal of the 2017 season was to explore the transition between the Archaic (3400 BC) and Preclassic (1000 BC) periods while focusing on technological and social continuity. This paper reports on the general excavation strategies, results, and avenues of future research pertaining to two main excavation areas. The 4000 sector of Colha, located within the larger settlement zone of the site, focused on defining the Archaic-Preclassic transition. While excavations within the 2000 sector, situated within the main site plaza, concentrated on investigating an Early Middle Preclassic village that was partially exposed in previous seasons. Notable artifact assemblages and features include burin spalls and associated shells, an early hearth, a ceramic cache, and diagnostic lithic tools.

We have been very fortunate this year to have Dr. Fred Valdez, Luisa Aebersold and their team graciously contribute to our research program in ceramic technology. They took time during their extremely busy field season to bring clay for our team to prepare and attempt to build pottery at Programme for Belize Archaeological Field School.
We have two different types of clay to research. The first clay is yellow clay CH4444. The second clay is iron-rich, red clay CH2222. 
Our first task was to visually analyze the artifacts from the two different lots. Ch4444 was associated with archaic tools. CH2222 was associated with Preclassic pottery. 
We designed four different techniques to prepare the clays for our study. Our first group of CH2222 was aged directly in water and hand sieved. Both clays were moist from retrieval. This became problematic for the iron- rich clays. The clays were extremely difficult to break down. We dried them in open baskets.
 The remaining CH2222 and CH4444 were prepared by hand. Due to the weather and the iron bearings clays these processes took several days to accomplish.

According to these accounts the new groups introduced cultural and religious traits into settlements in El Salvador, the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, and northwestern Costa Rica. Beginning in 2000, archaeologists from the University of Calgary have investigated various sites along the shore of Lake Cocibolca, searching for evidence of migration and colonization of the region. Based on these intensive excavations we have NOT identified evidence of the Pipil/Nicarao, and characteristics of the Chorotega are enigmatic at best. Although innovative features do appear beginning about AD 700, particularly in terms of polychrome ceramics and mortuary patterns, the evidence supports only limited Mexican contact but with more interaction with greater Central America.

",Other,Cultural Resources and Heritage Management,Mobility,"To paraphrase the symposium organizers, for decades changes in the pre-Columbian material culture of Central America were attributed to either migration or conquest. When I began archaeological research in Costa Rica in 1969 the endless debate was about Mesoamerican influence. Technological and iconographic linkages were frequently cited, but rarely were the mechanisms of the proposed linkages adequately defined or demonstrated archaeologically. In 2008, perhaps unduly influenced by having moved to California in 2004, I floated the concept of a “southern Mesoamerican Wedge” a la Kroeber. This wedge paralleled the Pacific coast and while the Paleo and Archaic periods were almost invisible, by the early Preclassic almost identical ceramics are found in the Soconusco, beneath downtown Managua, and in the Arenal region of Costa Rica. And, in a pattern even more complicated than was ever described for the Takic Wedge, the southern Mesoamerican Wedge is also intersected throughout Central America with river drainages that for all intent and purpose connected the Caribbean with the Pacific and low, natural “roads” or “saddles” between the volcanoes that accomplished the same objective.

The archaeological signatures for these two dynamical processes—Brownian motion versus Lévy flights—are potentially quite different, making them useful and practical to consider. It seems likely prima facie that both processes are good models for different kinds of prehistoric migrations, and, moreover, in each case tuning the parameters of the model yields different patterns.

",Intermediate Area,Ceramic Analysis,Identity/Ethnicity,"Ethnohistoric and colonial documents typically focus on detailing a socioeconomic and political landscape dominated by Chorotega and Nicarao groups for contact-period Pacific Nicaragua. Yet these texts simultaneously indicate that other groups living in isolated communities or urban barrios were also commonplace and included Maribios, Mazatec, Chondal, Matagalpans, Sumo-Ulwa, and possibly Lenca and/or Maya-speaking peoples, among others. As archaeologists, we are aware—many of us dutifully placing the convoluted language distribution map in our culture history write-ups. Despite this, most of these groups are not factored into theoretical discussions and are rarely, if ever, seriously discussed as part of the region’s archaeological past. Instead, a three-phase linear trajectory (Chibchan-Chorotega-Nicarao) premised on ‘great’ migration events ending in regional domination by foreigners and their intrusive material monoculture has been the interpretive norm. This inconsistency begs the questions: Do we really believe complex multicultural lifeways magically appeared with or immediately before the Spaniards? And if multicultural lifeways were a pre-Columbian norm in this area, as complex social organization at contact suggests, why can’t we see those other groups in the record?

",Intermediate Area,Iconography and Epigraphy,Iconography and Art,"Pacific Nicaragua has long been noted as a cultural crossroads, especially featuring historically documented migrants from central Mexico. Following ethnohistorical accounts, Nahuat speaking groups colonized the Rivas area in the Late Postclassic Ometepe period.  The most prominent diagnostic ceramic of this time was Luna Polychrome, often found in mortuary contexts. This paper presents a detailed analysis of over 50 Luna vessels from the Mi Museo collection. The overarching theme of the painted designs relates to the Praying Mantis. This interpretation coincides with oral traditions relating the mantis as the “Madre Culebra”, a powerful and revered predator of the insect world and closely affiliated with female symbolic authority. The association of these vessels with mortuary ritual suggest links to the Nahuat deity Cihuacoatl, a goddess of death and regeneration, whose name also translates as ‘woman serpent’.",Symposium,Presenter,Sharisse_McCafferty,4,15,4,Sa-morning

Normal diffusion is seen in the Department of Chinandega through the ceramics of the early facet of the Late Preclassic Cosigüina complex, which derive from the Providencia Sphere. This ceramic sphere originates from the southern highlands of Guatemala and western El Salvador and now extends at least to northwest Nicaragua. The evidence of superdiffusion lies with a type known as Delirio Red-on-white, which is found at scattered sites in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. We argue that its patchy and discontinuous distribution is evidence for superdiffusion because, as we show through design analysis and comparison of forms and pastes, Delirio is related to Coyotlatelcto types from Late Classic Central Mexico.

",Intermediate Area,Digital Archaeology: Simulation and Modeling,Mobility,"Sometime before AD 1, a dynamic interaction and exchange network developed among the villages and hamlets of Greater Nicoya. The range and frequency of trade within this region is demonstrated by geochemically sourced ceramic and stone artifacts. The travel routes along which these artifacts were traded remain poorly understood. Geographic information systems (GIS) offer a means to predictively model the optimal terrestrial and aquatic travel routes that interconnected the settlements of Greater Nicoya. Accounting for both pedestrian travel on land and canoe-borne travel in the rivers and lakes, I use a GIS to present a probable simulation of the travel infrastructure that facilitated the regional movement of trade goods. I then test and refine the results of my simulations against the rest of the archaeological record. By interpreting this simulated travel network and the given distribution of traded goods within an intersocietal interaction framework, I discuss the role that intraregional movement and mobility played in the evolution of the societies that once thrived in this section of southern Central America.

",Intermediate Area,Other,Mobility,"Traditional narratives within Nicaraguan archaeology, based on primarily ethnohistoric rather than archaeological evidence, have privileged the arrival of external actors from Central Mexico at the expense of indigenous developments and have emphasized imposed change rather than situated continuity. Especially given that as archaeologists, our primary sources are material culture, we should approach mobility from a materialist engagement with the flows and hardenings of matter, sensu Manuel De Landa. This framework will allow for more nuanced interpretations of multidirectional movement, as well as an acknowledgement of the emergent properties that may have arisen from these interactions. Such a nonlinear approach will require a redefinition of the spatial logics of orientation posited by culture-areas, aided by employing the concept of landscape as defined by historical ecology. It will move towards a re-entanglement of humans and environments, which I argue are enmeshed and inseparable. My research centers around Lake Cocibolca, tracing flows of lacustrine resources between the multiple communities of practice situated around and within it and the sedimentation of these flows in the landscape.

",Other,Other,Communities of Practice,"The relationship between individuals and urban soundscapes can tell us about the personhood and sonic practices of people in the past. To reconstruct the interaction between a musician and audience in archaeological contexts, I introduce a novel theoretical framework called ‘communities of engaged performance’ (CEP). CEP is defined as the transmission of knowledge through performance resulting in variable group-specific sound practices. CEP is derived and builds upon theories of ‘communities of practice’ and is identifiable in the archaeological record as intentional modifications to both space and sound-related artefacts. CEP is especially pertinent to the discussion of multicultural social organization, because it denotes group identity based on consistencies within practices rather than by ethnic origin. For example, variation in instrument design, playing of a musical instrument (gestures, finger positions, etc.), or in soundscapes might suggest the presence of several distinct communities of engaged musical performance.  On the other hand, consistency or shared practices across groups might reflect the development of a single performance community.

",Intermediate Area,Ceramic Analysis,Communities of Practice,"Despite being the largest country in Central America, Nicaragua’s archaeological record remains the least explored and most ignored. One consequence of this is that reconstructions of Nicaragua’s prehistory have tended to rely overmuch on rather sparse (and not necessarily reliable) ethnohistoric accounts in which migration from Mesoamerican homelands is heavily emphasized, generally to the detriment of other kinds of cultural phenomena, including indigenous developments that are not explicitly “Mesoamerican”. Meanwhile, only sporadic attention has been paid to the archaeological record itself, and the potential evidence that it provides for (a) actual migration and/or conquest, (b) interaction and mobility between groups within Nicaragua and beyond, and (c) multiculturalism across Greater Nicoya. This paper argues that understanding of Greater Nicoya’s multicultural prehistory would benefit from approaches in which archaeological interpretations are informed but not dominated by ethnohistoric evidence—approaches that not only treat migration as a cultural phenomenon that must be demonstrated in the record rather than taken for granted but which also are capable of recognizing archaeological evidence of potential interaction between diverse groups.",Symposium,Presenter,Larry_Steinbrenner,4,15,4,Sa-morning

",Intermediate Area,Other,Mobility,"Periodic changes in the pre-Columbian material culture of Central America are typically attributed to the impact of either migration to and/or conquest of regions by foreigners, or the diffusion of ideas along exchange networks. While technological and iconographic linkages are frequently raised as evidence for these events, very rarely are their mechanisms adequately defined or demonstrated archaeologically. Describing these changes, particularly involving groups of differing linguistic and/or ethnic backgrounds, traditional linear narratives tend to focus on episodic cultural succession—the replacement of a passive (generally ‘indigenous’) group by a well-defined donor group or worldview—when some critical tipping point is met. In the material culture of Central America, this tipping point is frequently identified by shifts in choice of raw material, technology, symbolic content, function, and/or decorative style.  

This symposium aims to transcend over-simplified notions of human mobility and social organization. In many regions, ethnohistoric and colonial records indicate that major centers frequently contained differing linguistic or ethnic groups at European contact.  We welcome all papers that explore human mobility from multiscalar, nonlinear perspectives, and/or the potential implications of multicultural lifeways for archaeological reconstructions. How might we better access and demonstrate mobility and multicultural social organization in the record?

Archaeological sites in Alaska are among the oldest in the Americas, providing valuable information concerning human/animal interactions. Although there is substantial amounts of archaeological information present in the literature, there is a distinct lack of indigenous ecological knowledge. The goal of this project is to combine traditional indigenous ways of knowing with archaeological methods to make inferences about past human behaviors. The traditional knowledge camp, conducted during the summer of 2017 along the banks of the Yukon River, was a collaboration between elder Paul Williams Sr. and the University of Alaska Fairbanks. It was created for elders to teach Gwich’in ways of knowing to community members and students in a traditional fish camp setting. This research utilized that learning space to explore the effects of traditional capture, processing, and cooking activities on fauna in a way which appropriately represented traditional elder knowledge. Isotopic analysis was then used to quantitatively associate the modern subsistence activities to prehistoric behavior.

How can we define the lithic landscape? How did humans provision themselves in eastern Beringia, and how did these provisioning behaviors change through time? Toolstone procurement and selection behaviors influence toolkits, mobility, and settlement strategies; therefore, they are important in explaining prehistoric behavioral adaptation and the complexities of landscape use. We can begin to explore toolstone procurement in the Nenana Valley of central Alaska through geochemical sourcing studies. Portable x-ray fluorescence (pXRF) is a useful geochemical tool for characterizing non-obsidian volcanic materials (basalts, dacites and andesites). In an effort to define the lithic landscape in the Nenana Valley and explore hunter-gatherer land-use strategies, this paper presents results of a raw material survey conducted during the 2015-2017 field seasons aimed at mapping the distribution of knappable volcanic materials in the valley.

There are occasions when the archaeological definition of toolstone material and the geological definition of the same toolstone material do not match. A situation where this discrepancy might arise is when archaeologists give a more specific name to a cryptocrystalline silicate that is difficult to identify based on visual analysis. An understanding of the geological definition and geochemistry of toolstone can allow archaeologist to ask more specific questions about toolstone provenance, procurement, and use.  The toolstone variability among sites in the Tangle Lakes Region is not well understood, and is thought to belong to two local quarries. This project seeks to understand the geochemical composition of two cryptocrystalline silicate toolstone quarries and visually similar artifacts from specific activity areas from three sites in the region at varying distances from the quarries. The toolstone variability will be defined by geochemical groupings using XRF and pXRF analysis. Future analysis will attempt to geochemically match the artifacts with the two quarries, and learn if there is more variation in the material than can be accounted for by the two quarries.

Recent research has sought to push beyond the significance of debatably diagnostic tool forms, microblades, in defining cultural complexes and has attempted to more fully address models of behavioral variability including mobility, lithic landscape learning, seasonality, site-specific or prey-specific variability, and raw material constraints. Comprehensive inter- and intra-site use-wear studies represent a promising avenue for better understanding the functionality of important elements of lithic tool kits.

This landscape approach to managing and interpreting resources is particularly important when looking at game drives. Many Alaskan game drives are comprised of stone alignments that were used to direct animal movement across a landscape. Game drives vary in form, but most are demarcated by stacked or piled rock cairns or monoliths. Some are extensive and complex while others are minimal and ephemeral, as they range from a few stacked rocks in a row to several hundred in long lines. Spatial analysis of game drives found in northern Alaska points to patterns that reflect intentional landscape use and integration with their surroundings, including intersecting valleys, water sources, ridgelines, and material sources.

However, compliance work for federal undertakings often focuses our attention and limited resources on the least significant and most abundant resources such as lithic and historic debris scatters.  We must avoid habitually collecting redundant data for upholding tested theories so that new questions can be posed and answered using more modern techniques.  Applying the National Register of Historic Places eligibility criteria in standardized ways and other increased efficiencies can free up time to spend on outreach, scientific inquiry, and the protection of sites with greater heritage and data values.  This presentation will demonstrate the need and means for a careful and scientific approach to making site eligibility determinations and management recommendations in order to facilitate a focus on the most culturally valuable resources.",Symposium,Presenter,Kelli_Barnes,4,14,4,Sa-morning

These are just a few examples of projects where the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) failed to protect cultural resources deemed significant by Native American tribes. In these instances, why did NHPA fail? Largely because NHPA does not consider impacts to the complete suite of cultural resources. It only addresses historic properties and historic properties “of traditional religious and cultural significance”. This narrow focus makes NHPA a less-than-perfect tool to deal with cultural resources when it comes to today’s current issues and concerns. Is there an alternative? For years, experts suggest that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is better equipped to protect a wider range of cultural resources.

This being the case, the questions always arise, how do we document these linear features and how do we remain consistent with recordation, context, significance and integrity beyond our lands? Many agencies are dealing with this using formal historic contexts or Multiple Property Documentation Forms as outlined by the United States National Park Service, while others are using exemptions and categorical exclusions in formal agreement documents.

Looting issues can be exacerbated by the limited on-the-ground resources of federal agencies that manage millions of acres. The proactive actions the BLM is taking against looting has resulted in increased Archaeological Resources Protection Act investigations, the recovery of looted artifacts, and educational campaigns to curb unintentional, destructive behaviors. The BLM-Utah’s dual approach of education and enforcement illustrates the active role the BLM is taking to reduce looting. The BLM-Utah manages large collections of archaeological artifacts recovered from law enforcement investigations and prosecutions, is currently determining best practices for the long-term curation of recovered artifacts, and is developing anti-looting centered interpretation of the collections.

What did this change look like within communities? How did local people adopt, adapt, or reject these new technologies and practices? Among the last to be conquered, the people of the Castro Culture of northwest Iberia produced some of the most technologically complex and visually stunning examples of Iberian metalwork. However little is known about the nature of metallurgy practiced at Castro sites. The Cividade de Bagunte, at the height of its occupation during the Roman period, can provide valuable insight into the social and technological strategies used by Castro people to cope with this transition.",Symposium,Presenter,Nadya_Prociuk,2,7,2,Sa-morning

Evidence procured to date from a number of such sites stretching from the Galician Region of Spain to the site of Monte Mozinho near the municipality of Penafiel in Portugal covers a span of time from Early Bronze Age to Roman Period and exhibits a combination of crops produced for human consumption, fodder produced for pastoral practices, and wild resource procurement for diet supplementation.  The location of Bagunte lends itself advantageously to both agricultural production and resource procurement for diet supplementation and fuel resources.

Further, the proximity of these sites to one another would have been ideal for trade and communication.  By analyzing ceramic assemblages, it is possible to determine the types of activities that dominated a settlement’s economy, such as vessels used for storing or transporting agricultural products, or ceramic objects used in craft production such as loom weights and spindle whorls. Drawing from behavioral economics, this research will investigate how colonial interactions and economic restructuring brought on by Roman conquest led to the adaptation, adoption, or abandonment of certain ceramic forms.

Despite this consensus, there is a pressing need for further research on the topic. Publications dedicated to the study of castro architecture are few, and they have mostly taken a broad approach that focuses on apparent commonalities between sites from across Galicia and northern Portugal. Authors have placed undue emphasis on singular features of the evidence from each site, overlooking the more complex and problematic questions that arise when a structure is viewed in the context of its own settlement. While these works have been effective in establishing some distinct architectural trends, their interpretive components are often oversimplified or unnecessarily speculative. Such an approach encourages tentative generalizations and contributes little toward an in-depth understanding of castro communities.

They make for ideal gardens when located within settlements, as their low elevation allows for the collection of deep and moisture-rich soil that provides an advantage for the cultivation of almost any plant. At the nearby site of Kulubá it has also been shown that rejolladas share some of the same significance within Maya cosmology as cenotes and caves. Their locations, deeper into the earth, may have been seen as places with additional potential for communication with the underworld. Ceramic, botanical and faunal data from units excavated within five rejolladas in central Tahcabo demonstrate garden cultivation within the features over the community’s long history. One rejollada demonstrated consistent ritual use through time. Today it is a place in which the Ch’a’ Cháak ceremony is practiced, and in the deep past it was a place in which at least one human burial was interred.

This means that during times of war, when state infrastructure breaks down and supply chains are threatened, people often take food security matters into their own hands. During 20th century conflicts, families ensured food security on the home front by building household gardens. Practically, the construction of war gardens resulted in decreased individual reliance on often fragile political systems and infrastructure. While this process could be viewed as isolating, families often viewed themselves as collectively contributing to the war effort by maintaining self-sufficiency. In this paper, I will look at historical examples of war gardens and victory gardens to assess how they provided an anchor of cultural continuity at the household level while at the same time altering broader demographic, economic, and political relationships. I will then use these data as a heuristic framework to consider how pre-Hispanic gardens transformed social relationships in the Peruvian Andes during times of war.",Symposium,Presenter,BrieAnna_Langlie,3.25,12,3.25,Sa-morning

I explore the significance of planting and plant life in regulating territorial use and notions of rights, access, and possession, as well as social relations and family ties. Through trabalho de campo (field labor), both communal and solitary, Gurupaenses continually transform this forested landscape into a mosaic of greenery of varying sizes, shapes, shades, and meaning. The work of tending, weeding, cutting, and harvesting shapes gardens, dooryards, trails, and interstitial spaces, simultaneously configuring identities and social relationships within and beyond kinship groups. The present landscape is the result of generations of management of plants, as gardens, fields, stands, or trees – which are, importantly, individuated and associated with specific community members or families.

Interpreting agroforestry practices from diachronic trends in firewood collection at the classic Maya city of Naachtun,Mesoamerica: Maya lowlands,Maya: Classic,Paleoethnobotany,Historical Ecology,"What can be drawn from anthracological data to infer long-term socio-environmental dynamics among ancient Mayas is a question that has received little attention. At Naachtun (Northern Peten, Guatemala), we studied charcoal remains from archaeological contexts in relation with pedological data to reconstruct forest resources and land management through time. Since the beginning of Naachtun's occupation at the end of the Preclassic period (˜ AD 150), domestic firewood economy seems to have been closely linked to the local agrarian system. Wood was collected in semi-opened woodlands, suggesting a reliance on both fallow lands and preserved forests probably close to human settlements. In that context, the observation of an important shift in firewood collection strategies during the second half of the Late Classic period (AD 750-830), from opportunistic gathering of a wide range of forest species to a heavier reliance on fruit tree species, allows us to draw hypotheses on the intensification of arboriculture practices and the progressive transformation of woodlands around the site. As this shift occurred rapidly while the city experienced its demographic peak, it could express an adaptation strategy throughout Naachtun society, utilizing forest garden plots for its firewood supply as a result of higher pressure on local resources.",Symposium,Presenter,Lydie_Dussol,3.25,12,3.25,Sa-morning

Historically, archaeologists have focused on outfields to reconstruct ancient agriculture and subsistence practices. On the other hand, researchers studying contemporary gardening practices understand the cultural, economic, and ritual significance of gardens. Gardens are spaces where food, medicine, construction materials, and plants of aesthetic value are grown for household consumption and for sale in markets. They are also spaces to conduct household activities, generate supplemental income, and maintain cultural memory. Archaeological explorations of garden spaces, particularly in the American Neotropics, have tended to focus on their identification, through soil chemical, archaeobotanical, and spatial analyses. Now that we have refined our ability to identify garden spaces, we can turn to more anthropologically oriented questions. How do households use cultivated infield spaces, and what meanings are given to these activities? How do gardens serve as spaces for the display of wealth and status and as spaces of cultural memory?

These were disposed of in natural caves along cliffsides surrounding residential sites as well as in a variety of above-ground mausoleum constructed at highly visible locations.  In this paper, I develop a typology of sepulchres and analyze their spatial patterning.  Building on ethnographic and ethnohistorical material, I argue that the different types of mortuary constructions and their specific distribution across the Rapayán landscape reflected different kinds of mortuary programs. On the one hand, rituals honoring the dead located in caves and smaller mausoleums grounded people in place and participated in the construction of group identity. I suggest that the deceased in this funerary program became ancestral spirits and were likely commemorated as an anonymous collectivity. On the other, rituals celebrating the deceased placed in tall multi-story buildings distributed at the top of hillside embodied political competition among kin groups and were ultimately used to legitimize power.  I suggest that the deceased in this funerary program became ancestors and were celebrated as the named founding ancestors of kin groups.",Electronic Symposium,Presenter,Alexis_Mantha,2,7,2,Sa-morning

 In this paper, I will summarize the ebb and flow of foreign powers and local autonomy in the region as seen through the caves, mountains, and archaeological sites that are a fundamental source of local identity and play an active role in the lives of the Maya who live around them in the past and present.  As a result, they serve as microcosms of the entire region, and by understanding the history of conquest and independence of the sacred landscape one can understand the history of the region itself.

Implementation of stylistic seriation bolstered by art from more securely dated archaeological deposits allowed for the development of a chronological sequence of rock art styles in Huánuco. The research revealed rock art played a prominent role in expressing changing social relations in the region. This paper focuses on the rockshelter, Gonga, and its rock art panel that was created and repainted multiple times over the millennia. An early painting depicts a human couple, while later repaintings emphasized the female character and the male figure was smeared with paint. I propose that the initial painting served to instantiate the people represented by the figures as founding ancestors of an ayllu (kinship group) based on the timing of the painting in conjunction with the appearance of public burial structures called chullpas. The highlighting of the female character at the expense of the male indicates a negotiation or contestation of prevailing social relations. Finally, I argue that rock art was a medium for negotiation because the mountains where they were painted were considered active, sacred agents.",Electronic Symposium,Presenter,Jonathan_Dubois,2,7,2,Sa-morning

For over five centuries this resource-rich territory served as a junction for Indigenous and European colonial encounters, where interethnic and intercontinental political alliances and conflicts came forcefully into play. In addition to leaving material remains scattered throughout the landscape, this political history was encoded in ritualized performances still practiced today in these coastal communities, as well as in their oral traditions and territorial-narratives. Our interdisciplinary research project in the region demonstrates that mountains, caves, lagoons, and the ocean itself served as portals for both animal and human agents, moving and operating in between the physical and spiritual realms.

Instead, it was understood as being imbued with animate, generative forces such as Earth spirits and ancestors who were actively engaged on a regular basis as part of the culture-making process. These beings and forces were accessed through sacred landmark portals—caves, rockshelters, boulders, mountains, hills, and bodies of water—variably called wak’a, ch’een, and tzuultqu’a—where ritual petitions were made for gaining their favor, where community origins were celebrated, and where rulers demonstrated their supernaturally-sanctioned right to rule.

Politicians, from the left and right, bemoan what they term “crumbling infrastructure,” offering fixes by way of material and technological improvements to roads, waterways, cities, and energy grids.  Scholars draw on and expand posthumanist theories to analyze and expose how infrastructure does not just passively support social aims, but actively shapes (and subverts) human intentions. These discussions sharpen focus on the material characteristics and necessities of infrastructure, but frequently neglect to equally take into account the ideological mechanisms—processes of labor coordination, perceptions of progress, or projects for sustainable ecology—that are essential to and inseparable from infrastructure.  With this paper, I ask how archaeologists, with their unique ability to record and interpret long-term socio-material processes, might add to such discussions of infrastructure. I argue that “crumbling infrastructure” is a misnomer because it defines infrastructure as fixed materials rather than fluid entities that are parts of broader assemblages comprising things, people, and ideas. I present data from Cusco, Peru during early Spanish colonization to examine the interwoven ideologies and materials that can bring infrastructure into being, and relegate it to ruin.

Despite some investiture from ruling elites and temples, the material evidence for agro-infrastructural development suggests that it was not merely a project of state or institutional design. Rather, its development might more productively be characterized as a process of “growth” in which socio-material systems for facilitating the movement and production of matter and things emerged in relation to a range of differentiated actors and unruly cultivation conditions. The durable associations of soils, cultigens, and water appear to belie the common characterization of the Raichur Doab as a space of inherent “fertility” and calls into question the assumption that the region’s unique multiculturalism during the medieval period was an outcome of competition for its economic resources, as is commonly emphasized.",Symposium,Presenter,Andrew_Bauer,2,7,2,Sa-morning

",Historic,Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology,Settlement Patterns,"The Spanish conquest of the Philippines redesigned the indigenous landscape to adhere to the idealized orthogonal plan outlined by King Philip II’s Ordinances of 1573, centered on the church plaza. This reconfiguration facilitated the successful political, economic, and religious control of the colonial possession. An aspect of this resettlement plan is the concept of Bajo de Campana (under the bell) that implied control through the ringing of the church bell. The plaza complex, which is exemplified by the policy of reducción, projects a Spanish ideal Catholic Society, whereby the configuration of the physical landscape was ordered. Reducción aimed to consolidate colonial control over Philippine indigenous communities by compelling prominent individuals to relocate into poblaciones within hearing distance of church-bells. Bell ringing ordered daily life by signaling times to congregate and by marking special occasions. The audibility of church-bells also marked the extent of the Crown’s territorial holdings. To understand the processes associated with this colonial accommodation, we explore the social, religious, and environmental ramifications of Spanish settlement-building programs in the Philippines by examining spatial, acoustic, ethnohistoric, and archaeological data from plaza complexes located at two Spanish-era church sites: Quipayo and St. Francis of Assisi (both established in 1578).",Symposium,Presenter,Jared_Koller,2,7,2,Sa-morning

I argue that this cosmology contrasts infrastructures of the recent past as dangerous and polluting against infrastructures of the distant past as sacred and pure. This paper approaches this matter via the analysis of archaeological, historical, and ethnographic data over the past 1000 years in the Basin of Mexico. This case is particularly relevant because this region’s landscapes, places, and people both have defied and haven fallen within the limits of the Anthropocene cosmology. The development in infrastructures tied to varying institutional systems has always had to encounter—physically, socially, and culturally—the materiality of precedent, a trajectory that shows the Anthropocene is not simply geological or cultural but also is political.

Recent studies have sought to alter this impression as part of larger trends that seek to ground our understanding of pre-modern pastoralists in concrete faunal, botanical, isotopic, landscape, and historical data, which clearly show the effect that pastoral practices and infrastructure have had on cultural landscapes through time. I draw on ethnographic and archaeological case studies from the Middle East to discuss some general political, social, and environmental issues affecting the elaboration of pastoralist infrastructure in seasonal territories and the complex relationships transhumant people have with the infrastructure of surrounding sedentary communities.

However, emerging transdisciplinary conversations on infrastructures are challenging social scientists and historians to rethink conventional, functional interpretations of infrastructures, and instead to assess their materiality in social and historical ways that go beyond simply fulfilling societal needs. Infrastructures are increasingly seen as unruly or fragile historical assemblages that can transcend or disrupt the historical conditions of their production. In this symposium, we ask contributors to pull on their expertise and case studies in studying the built environment, technologies, and landscapes to respond to one central question about infrastructures: how do physical and social dimensions of infrastructures relate across time and space? We urge contributors to address this problem through specific archaeological case studies and by considering issues that might be subsumed within them. These include (1) infrastructures that facilitate some political projects, prevent others, and outlive still others; (2) infrastructures that are invisible and taken for granted or provide the material for spectacle, conflict, or violence, and (3) the multiple intended and unintended dimensions and consequences that stem from the coupling of social and physical infrastructures.",Symposium,Chair (Primary),Christopher_Morehart,2,7,2,Sa-morning

In this paper we present the preliminary results of our field season this past summer in the Cerro Coyotepetl neighborhood of Tepeticpac, a señorío of Tlaxcallan. Archaeological prospection methods and remote sensing included magnetometry, electrical resistivity and photogrammetry by drone. Though our work is ongoing, and another geophysical survey season is planned, results were confirmed by excavations on one domestic terrace. These excavations revealed the remains of four rooms whose occupation spans the late pee-Hispanic and early Colonial periods. We reflect on the success and limitations of our methods in identifying the modification of the tepetate bedrock creating a habitable space, and in our ability to detect walls, hearths, and other domestic features. ",Symposium,Presenter,Jorge_Blancas,2.5,8,2.5,Sa-morning

The work serves to contextualize the space contained by the site’s enceinte, a physical barrier that serves also as a boundary feature. Earlier investigations into the site interior and the ramparts of the enceinte itself begged for a comparative data set, as the significance of a barrier apparently built to keep people out relies in part on an understanding of what existed outside of it. The hilltop excavations uncovered a sequence of occupation containing multiple periods apparently corresponding to the chronology of Muralla de León. Further, evidence in support of dating the defensive architecture at the site to the early phase of occupation there emerged from one of these centers, where a possible rampart wall was uncovered beneath later construction volume and set atop bedrock.

",Intermediate Area,Bioarchaeology/Skeletal Analysis,Mortuary Archaeology,"Greater Chiriquí, the pre-Columbian cultural sphere encompassing western Panama and southern Costa Rica, has been subjected to intense looting activities since the mid-19th century. Nevertheless, archaeological exploration of the area to date has successfully contextualized the nature and transitions of non-perishable material culture. However, organic remains rarely survive in funerary contexts due to the high acidity of the soil, high humidity, and high precipitation in this region. Human remains almost never remain in the stone-lined tombs of Greater Chiriquí, in which one or more occupants were buried (as evidenced by the number and placement of mortuary offerings). But in shell-bearing middens along the coast, the increased soil pH from high calcium carbonate contents allows better preservation of human and animal bone. These differences in preservation have led to a sharp division in the variety and quality of mortuary information derived from coastal (lowland) and inland (highland) sites. The present study traces the few examples of human remains recovered from archaeological sites in the region and what they tell us about the cultural activities and health of pre-Columbian populations.

Similarities in material culture suggest local and trans-isthmic cultural relationships within Greater Chiriquí and a pattern of scattered hamlets associated with the exploitation of marine and lowland ecosystems. In order to provide a model for this settlement pattern, we offer a theoretical model based on ethnohistorical accounts, ethnographic information and current biodemographic research based on living indigenous populations of southern Central America. Kin-based population structure is the result of a migratory behavior of a familial group in which fragmentation, movement and relocation occurs among populations of high mobility such as hunter-gathers and mobile agriculturalists. The information provided by these lines of research suggests that ecological conditions and kin-based population structure may be responsible for the population aggregation along the Caribbean coast of Central America and can explain similar behavior seen in the archaeological record of the Caribbean lowlands of Greater Chiriquí.",Symposium,Presenter,Norberto_Baldi,4,16,4,Sa-morning

",Intermediate Area,Other,Architecture,"Chiriquí Period (700-1500 CE) archaeological sites have been the subject of systematic scientific research for more than 50 years. However, archaeologists are only recently beginning to define and understand regional and temporal variations in artistic styles, settlement patterns, and village organization.  In this paper, I summarize emerging patterns in village placement, cemetery organization, and the construction of public space. Continuities in the elements of constructed spaces, such as the use of conical house forms, cobble pavements, and public plazas, endure for the duration of Chiriquí, but the ways that these architectural features were interpreted and arranged changed dramatically, particularly during the tenth and fourteenth centuries, likely signaling the key changes in ideology and social dynamics that occurred across the region.

These attributes make the few challenges that remain for conducting archaeology underwater more than worth the effort.  Early human occupation in the Great Lakes has been difficult to investigate as acidic soils and dynamic water levels left many archaeological remains either poorly preserved or submerged. Ongoing underwater research in Lake Huron is beginning to fill gaps in our knowledge of early hunter-gatherers in this region, and provides unique data of caribou hunting 9,000 years ago using stone built hunting structures.

Past research has demonstrated that Florida cherts can be coarsely differentiated into various quarry clusters on the basis of microfossil inclusions, and more recent research has suggested that geochemically characterizing these cherts may further improve provenance determinations. New methodological approaches include using a combination of microfossil analysis, NAA, and LA-ICP-MS to provide accurate qualitative and quantitative descriptions for Florida cherts. Additionally, the sampling and description of previously unstudied prehistoric quarry sites is improving our understanding of the geochemical and microscopic variability inherent in Florida cherts. By intensively sampling both terrestrial and inundated sites on a cluster-by-cluster basis, our characterization resolution will be significantly enhanced on regional and local levels, and new conclusions can be drawn about past human mobility within an improved geographic and temporal framework. Current advances in chert provenance studies will form the core of future research on Paleoindian lithic technological organization in Florida, and using modern analytical techniques on new and existing collections will greatly benefit this research.",Symposium,Presenter,Adam_Burke,2.5,9,2.5,Sa-morning

A lack of robust unfluted point assemblages found in secure context in association with radiocarbon datable material has made interpreting these types difficult. However, a few sites in the Southeast contain unfluted lanceolate points within relative stratigraphic sequences or associated with extinct fauna. Based on this evidence from these sites, these styles are often attributed to the Middle Paleoindian period (~10,600-10,200 rcybp). The Middle Paleoindian period in North America is theorized to be a time of regional specialization and settlement following a phase during which people maintained generalized, adaptable toolkits suited for high mobility. However, the rarity of discreet Middle Paleoindian components in the Southeast has made this theory difficult to test in the region. Here, I examine the only site in the Southeast at which excavations have revealed a discrete Suwannee lithic component; the Ryan-Harley site (8JE1004) in North Florida.

However, climate and other environmental shifts have left many formerly terrestrial landscapes submerged, obscuring them and rendering interpretation difficult. Despite this complication, submerged sites and landscapes can offer enhanced site preservation, unique taphonomic considerations, access to powerful remote sensing tools, and unique data for analysis. To take advantage of these benefits, archaeologists must overcome challenges that differ from terrestrial contexts. Nonetheless, these efforts on submerged sites and landscapes contribute significant data concerning human cultural developments during prehistory, especially when human groups faced rapid shifts in both ecology and climate.

This symposium explores the challenges archaeologists face when working on drowned landscapes and the range of new information these rich environments have provided. Papers presenting methodology and results for underwater landscape surveys, site testing and exploration, and underwater excavation demonstrate the growing importance of this area of research. With sites ranging in age from the terminal Pleistocene through the Late Holocene, explorations of underwater landscapes and drowned terrestrial sites are invaluable for current and future archaeological research.

",Neolithic,Survey,Communities of Practice,"The collaborative, American-Hungarian Prehistoric Interactions on the Plain Project explores the past through the reconstruction of interactions. Investigations on interactions as an active mode of social investment and social construction challenges normative concepts of “culture” by modeling socio-cultural boundaries as a dynamic and negotiated process, as opposed to a static categorically assigned social unit. Moreover, our research contextualizes regional developments as the result of multi-scalar social processes. Initially, PIPP focused on the regional scale and reconstructed Late Neolithic (5,000 – 4,500 BC) long- and short-distance interactions between Herpály and Tisza sites through the stylistic, technological, and compositional analyses of lithics and ceramics. The results suggested a strongly enforced socio-cultural boundary between Tisza and Herpály sites in the Körös region. However, by focusing on the regional scale, the local dynamic interactions have been completely obscured. The current phase of PIPP focuses on the local scale at the Herpály site of Csökmo-Káposztás Domb to investigate how variation in household access to long- and short-distance interaction networks resulted in the previously modeled strongly enforced socio-cultural boundaries.",Symposium,Presenter,Danielle_Riebe,2.25,7,2.25,Sa-morning

",Bronze Age,Other,Social and Political Organization,"The transition to the Middle Bronze Age in the Carpathian Basin encompassed a broad range of changes in material culture, settlement and social organization. Upon first glance, the Körös-Region was no different from its neighbours. Tell sites emerged, population increased, farming intensified, and people engaged in long distance trade. The international Bronze Age Körös Off-Tell Archaeology (BAKOTA) project has studied this area through settlements and mortuary archaeology for over 11 years. Our research reveals that despite expectations, the Körös-Region followed a path quite different from its neighbours during the Middle Bronze Age: it did not experience the emergence of social inequality typical of societies just dozens of kilometers away. In this paper, we address how collaboration between North-American and European researchers shaped our questions, and how our project culture and language--(“Hunglish”)—have built on the successes and legacy of the Körös Regional Archaeological Project.

",Chalcolithic,Other,Settlement Patterns,"At about 3500 BC, a seemingly intrusive population of burial mound (kurgan) builders undertook a long-term series of migrations that resulted in the disruption of settlement patterns and social structures throughout eastern and central Europe. This phenomenon coincided with the emergence of the expansive and geographically homogeneous Baden material culture. From the 1960s to the 1990s, a series of archaeologists investigated the relationship between kurgan builders and Baden in the Carpathian Basin at various geographic scales. They questioned whether the Baden tradition was adopted by indigenous populations, if the tradition arrived with people via migration, and what role, if any, kurgan builders played in the emergence of Baden. The research presented in this paper is a reassessment and continuation of work done by researchers such as Maria Gimbutas and Andrew Sherratt, developed within the context of long-term, international, collaborative projects that address broad anthropological and archaeological issues related to social organization and hereditary inequality. Ultimately, I conclude that the shift in material cultural witnessed during the Late Copper Age on the Great Hungarian Plain is consistent with models of social change developed by other presenters in this session.",Symposium,Presenter,Timothy_Parsons,2.25,7,2.25,Sa-morning

",Neolithic,Other,Settlement Patterns,"This session provides an overview of collaborative prehistoric archaeological research in the Carpathian Basin of Eastern Europe. The past 20 years have witnessed an unprecedented increase in the number of international, collaborative, archaeological research programs in the region. Building on the long-standing tradition of innovative, ambitious, regional research in central and eastern Europe, recent long-term collaborations between North American and local archaeologists and specialists have yielded groundbreaking results in the prehistory of the Holocene. These projects are significant not only at the regional level but also have contributed to major, continental and global, anthropological questions related to early village social dynamics and the emergence of hereditary inequality. The session includes papers by the directors of long-term, international, collaborative projects who will address: 1) the contributions their projects have made to major anthropological questions, 2) how the amalgamation of different research traditions, methods, and theoretical perspectives rendered their programs successful, and 3) a critical reflection of what they can do better to promote multidisciplinary international collaboration.

",Other,Remote Sensing/Geophysics,Water Management and Irrigation,"In this paper, we evaluate the relationship between humans and water in the Khmer Empire (~9th to 15th centuries CE) through a case study of the medieval water management system of Koh Ker, Cambodia. Koh Ker is best known for the seventeen years between 928-944 CE when it served as the political center of the Khmer Empire under the reign of Jayavarman IV. During this time, Jayavarman IV constructed a seven-kilometer-long dike to the North of the city. Here, we present the results from a ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey at the main outlet of the Northeastern portion of the dike. Our results provide insight into the engineering of the dike. They also suggest that the sophisticated hydraulic engineering project may have been an attempt by Jayavarman IV to centralize water management and strengthen political power.

Previous studies examining Hohokam irrigation assumed that there was a direct correlation between the amount of available water within the lower Salt River and the amount of land that could be irrigated. The amount of available water is necessary for assessing where water was sufficient for successful crops and where insufficient water made agricultural production difficult; however, time is also important. A key component of modern irrigation strategies is the amount of time required apply sufficient water to fields for successful crop growth. Despite its importance, time has not been included in assessments of Hohokam irrigated acreage.

These case studies include the draining of lake of Texcoco by the Spanish in modern day Mexico city, modern development in Siem Reap, Cambodia, and the construction of the Aswan Dam to control the floods of the Nile river. We contend that decision making parties on water management in these contemporary cities have problematically based decisions for the organization and management of their water system on binary models of seasonality (i.e., wetlands/drylands).

The Pamunkey Indian Tribe, located in the Tidewater region of Virginia, has a long history of utilizing materials from the Reservation’s archaeological record in a variety of ways. For over a century tribal members have reused artifacts in methods similar to their intended function, and they have reimagined them to create artwork and encourage artistic inspiration. Archaeology has always played a visible role in the lives of Pamunkey tribal members, from the exhibitions displayed at the community’s museum, to the multitude of artifacts one can find along the surrounding banks of the Pamunkey River. Unfortunately, this visibility and engagement on the Reservation is in stark contrast to the archaeology of Native Americans elsewhere in the region. Interweaving Pamunkey perspectives, opinions and memories with ethnographic and archaeological research, this paper contextualizes tribal members’ reuse and reimagining of the Reservation’s archaeological record throughout the past century.

Historic sites are spaces where national and personal identities are dynamically produced and negotiated.  Ideals of equity and realities of disparity may be brought into relief (or not) by telescoping the past into the space and place of the present.  These connections between past and present lives and identities are often made most salient through sites bearing artifacts interpreted through archaeology.  The authority of material culture and even more so, human remains, can profoundly transform understandings of space as having a contested past critically connected to socio-political and economic systems of the present.  Contests over histories articulated with such sites reflect the recognition and obfuscation of such conflict in daily lived experience.

Few studies have attempted to connect aboriginal ceramics research with contemporary Native peoples, either through past-to-present identity connections or through Indigenous community engagement. Additionally, there have been few efforts to integrate research across New England’s contemporary geopolitical boundaries. Recognizing these deficiencies in regional scholarship, this paper discusses two ceramics studies from New England—each exploring concepts of identity. One study centers on potters living in the Penobscot River Valley in Maine during the Ceramic Period (3050-450 B.P.), and the other focuses on the Late Woodland period (1300-1600 AD) through 17th century potters in the Connecticut River Valley in Massachusetts. Each study applied Indigenous archaeologies and technological choice strategies to an archaeological problem. However, the motivations behind the studies and the social contexts of the researchers influenced the research process and interpretations. This paper reviews these studies and the challenge of using ceramics as a central element in constructing or assigning identity while contemplating the range of factors that influence how researchers make connections between past and present peoples in the geopolitical landscape of New England.

This works distinctly on the assumption that these identities and their linked ceramic traditions are stable and unchanging; ceramics that do not fit into the expected pattern are often explained away as trade items or the arrival of new ethnic groups. This paper instead argues that ceramics reflect the sequence of ceramic manufacture generated by individual potters whose behaviors reinforce a community of practice, open to change over time through innovation and interaction. A series of detailed ceramic analysis methods were developed to interpret data from four related 17th and 18th century sites, tracking the diaspora and culture change of the Apalachee, a Native American group originally from Northern Florida. In the case of examining the ceramics of post-diaspora Apalachee, these assemblages allow an in-depth study of ceramic practice with the unique advantage of also having substantial historic documents identifying the potters’ ethnic identity.

After it was excavated in the 1980s, the collection was stored away and went largely unstudied for the last thirty years. When I first began my research on this ‘orphaned’ site, I was struck by the large pit features containing evidence of ritual feasting and a wide variety of ceramic types. Adhering to the old trope that ‘pots equal people’, I initially assumed that this site was one in which different groups aggregated for rituals that increased social bonds, eventually helping them coalesce into the Algonquian groups encountered by the first English colonists. As my research progressed, I came to realize that the ceramic varieties are more indicative of the ritual practice itself than they are different groups of people. Hatch is a site that appears to be of great ritual significance to the Late Woodland people of coastal Virginia.

We might think of ceramics as landscape “caught in a flash”, a bringing together of different geological places into newly combined forms. Ecological thinking in Northern Rio Grande Pueblos frames this bringing together as a fluid gathering of forces that flow in and out of one another. “Deep ecology” is one current term the social sciences for this relational field of human and non-human interaction in the landscape— for Pueblo potters, it is how the world is. 

This paper outlines a deep ecology of pottery from a Spanish land grant community and a neighboring Tiwa Pueblo. I present ongoing research on the composition of ceramics from these two places, a study that gives insight into how different communities engaged with the landscape. Comparative ceramic ecology offers a framework for thinking about historical relationships that includes but also moves beyond questions of ethnicity and identity to a focus on how people locate themselves within socio-environmental systems.",Symposium,Presenter,Valerie_Bondura,4,14,4,Sa-morning

The rock art appears as either isolated, often barely visible, communications with the heavily patinated basalt surfaces on which it is pecked; or as sites that are made up of the dense iterative marks left by itinerant hunters, marks that transformed boulders, reshaping them in line with the natural ecologies of which they are a part.

The ubiquity of canine burials attests to their historical role as complex social actors in human society, prompting actions and performances, taboos and transgressions. To access the true depth of meaning in many canine remains, then, we must examine them with the level of precision normally reserved for human burials. This paper offers a close reading of the remains of four dogs buried in Room 822, a D-shaped kiva from T’aitöna (Pot Creek Pueblo). These dogs were ritually buried and show evidence of having been skinned before interment. The cultural significance of skins and dogs is analyzed in this paper through engagements with both descendant oral histories and folklore, as well as the theory of Amerindian perspectivism best known through the writings of Viveiros de Castro.

Recently, post-humanist thinking has gained popularity as an approach, urging us to think about human and non-humans relationally, as having contingent qualities that vary in relation to their interaction over time. Simultaneously, we see increasing attempts to think with indigenous philosophies and descendent communities about what the environment is and does. However, there remains a disconnect between approaches that seek to include indigenous philosophies and/or post-humanist approaches, and much work of the ecological sciences which are developing at a rapid pace, providing greater precision and clarity of information. This paper considers the history of archaeology’s relationship to the idea and study of ecology, and proposes the concept of “Deep Ecologies” as an approach to human-nonhuman interactive pasts that offers the opportunity to bridge some of these perceived divides, while also being attentive to the politics of attempts to do so and the appropriative histories of archaeological work in this vein.

Participants in this session present original research into the ecological history of the Northern Rio Grande from the Archaic through colonial periods. Individual papers consider the histories of particular anthropo-ecological practices, including hunting, herding, farming, and plant collection, and each emphasizes the way non-human agencies have shaped human communities in the region. In bringing these papers together, we hope to engage a deeper conversation about archaeological approaches to the emergence, persistence, and variability in human/non-human ecological relationships over time. In the process, we also report on the first ten years of work by the Gorge Project, an inter-institutional research collective formed to study the landscapes and histories of north-central New Mexico.

The past decade saw development of the “open government” digital information paradigm for public availability of information that underpins the functions of governance. Open government data provide a base for the interested public to offer expertise in aspects of necessary analyses, and to derive further public value from reuse of government data in novel ways. The open government concept has affected the practice and communication of scientific data in regulatory regimes as far flung as climate science, health science, and archaeology, among many others. In 2007 the “eight principles of open government” were coined by a group of public advocates, followed rapidly by a mosaic of federal, state, and local initiatives. The Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA) is a completely free, big data, open government data project, centered at several public institutions; DINAA embodies open government practices to develop a novel linked-open data network of archaeological site primary data and related records across the internet.

Particular attention is paid to geomasking techniques, which communicate observed spatial relationships while obscuring sensitive geographic coordinates. Currently, only two geomasking techniques are widely used in archaeology: aggregating archaeological site locations into grids or administrative units, or placing points that represent site locations at a particular distance from their true locations. These techniques, while useful, are part of a larger and growing suite of tools that visually convey spatial data without revealing sensitive site locations.

In 2001 the Iowa Office of the State Archaeologist, (OSA), was archiving 20GB of data on a 100GB server.  16 years later the office is serving 32TB on several server systems and plans are in place to archive 60TB over the next 4 years.  In addition to space needs the office must also make this data in its many forms accessible to outside entities.  
In the not so distant past archaeologists secured and stored paper, photos and film in Hollinger boxes stacked to the ceilings in many places.  These days many archaeological agencies have scanned and archived massive amounts of data to server systems which takes up less space and can contain many times more data.  The OSA has taken advantage of many grants to scan and archive over 400,000 sheets of paper and 58,853 photos and slides.  The advantage of this undertaking; accessibility and scalability.   
Moving into the future the OSA must develop and plan for the security storage and accessibility in ways that protect sensitive data.  Security is paramount in any organization but especially so when culturally sensitive data is in place.

In addition, the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) requires all federal agencies to maintain inventories of their historic properties.  For decades, the NPS has relied upon three inventory systems: The List of Classified Structures, the Cultural Landscapes Inventory (CLI), and the Archeological Sites Management Information System (ASMIS). These systems began decades ago as paper files and continue today as electronic databases accessed via the internet.
  The inventories allow NPS to maintain and update critical information including resource type, location, condition, threats, and disturbances.  As the relevant technologies continue to develop with what seems like increasing rapidity, even these relatively modern databases are being rapidly rendered obsolete.  The NPS Cultural Resources, Science, and Partnerships directorate has begun work to modernize these systems, and to facilitate their further integration with GIS technologies and other NPS programs, and incorporate elements of the now defunct Ethnographic Resources Inventory (ERI).  This paper discusses the issues faced as NPS updates these crucial tools for a second century of service.",3107,Electronic Symposium,Presenter,David_Gadsby,2.5,9,2.5,Sa-morning,24,680,NA,Jolene,Smith,NA,jolene.smith@dhr.virginia.gov,804-338-0819,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Futures and Challenges in Government Digital Archaeology,Multi-regional/comparative,Other,Digital Archaeology,Cultural Resource Management,"Within the public sector, archaeologists and our agencies use a range of technologies to “do” archaeology in support of heritage management laws and mandates, thereby producing digital data. We are also faced with curating large volumes of digital media and datasets created by others. The quantity of data and speed of change pose challenges in making information useful and accessible internally, to researchers, the private sector, and the general public. But these factors also introduce new opportunities for understanding the material record and conveying its value.

Where are we now at various levels of government service and public outreach? Where do we hope to go? How can we collaborate across geopolitical boundaries? What would we build if we were free of financial and technological constraints? This electronic symposium will explore the possibilities, along with friction points and unintended consequences of the digital deluge through demonstrations, case studies, and discussion.",Electronic Symposium,Chair (Primary),Jolene_Smith,2.5,9,2.5,Sa-morning
