over the past two decades, migration of paleoindian ancestors along the pacific coast has become the dominant origin hypothesis mainly because: 1) arrival at monte verde by 14,300 cal bp (or even 19,000 cal bp, as recently claimed) requires a still earlier emigration from beringia and 2) the alternative “ice-free corridor” ostensibly was not habitable by large herbivores before 13,000 cal bp. however, the coastal hypothesis cannot account for many inconvenient facts. these include: absence of pre-13,000 cal bp sites on long expanses of habitable and archaeologically visible coast, from the aleutian islands to the atacama desert; genomic evidence of all native americans’ descent from interior-adapted south siberian and clovis populations; and absence from coastal east asia of both any credible ancestral non-microlithic archaeological complexes and the expected ancestral haplotypes (e.g., the q-l330 male lineage) in ancient and recent genomes.
