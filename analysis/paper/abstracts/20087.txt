analysis of the faunal assemblage from thabadimasego, an early iron age site in northeastern botswana, contributes to the growing notion that hunting played a larger-than-expected role in the subsistence pattern of the area’s communities. beyond understanding what they ate, what do the faunal remains tell us about the subsistence technology of botswana’s early iron age? recent studies have focused on metallurgy and ceramic technology, but faunal patterns can provide information on the use of other technologies, including ones that don’t usually survive in the archaeological record. this paper will discuss the evidence for the use of ephemeral materials as indicated by thabadimasego’s assemblage, as contextualized by evidence from other regional sites.
