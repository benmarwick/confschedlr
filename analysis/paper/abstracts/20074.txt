cooking food conferred an energetic advantage to our pre-human ancestors and became one of the hallmark characteristics of the human strategy set. accessing fuel remains a common problem for many human societies. yet anthropologists do not often take the costs of gathering fuel into account when modeling subsistence and settlement. this paper presents a model that incorporates firewood tradeoffs into human choices about what to eat and where to live, and examines a hypothetical case for the north american great basin. applications of this model in both archaeological and modern ethnographic contexts will allow anthropologists and ecologists to illuminate firewood-mediated relationships between people and woodlands.
