this paper presents the results of a meta-analysis of soil organic carbon measurements associated with pre-columbian dryland agricultural fields in the southwestern u.s. and northwestern mexico. in aggregate, rock alignments and terraces are associated with significantly higher organic carbon concentrations, and this effect is pronounced in sandy parent material. the results support a hypothesis that resource conserving features constructed by indigenous farmers continue to influence the ecology of drylands by enhancing plant productivity in the most water limited settings.
