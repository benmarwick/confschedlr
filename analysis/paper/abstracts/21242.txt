hydrogen isotopes in archaeological bone collagen (i.e. d2h-collagen) are poorly understood, but can potentially facilitate new understanding of the complex relationship between trophic level (i.e. animal protein consumption) and meteoric water controls on hydrogen isotopes in omnivorous humans.  these concurrent influences on human d2h-collagen values were examined in 11 north american archaeological sites.  the d2h-collagen values were compared to bone hydroxyapatite oxygen isotopes (i.e. d18o-hap) and bone collagen nitrogen isotopes (i.e. d15n-collagen), which are proxies for meteoric water influence and amount of consumed protein, respectively.  pooled site data yield moderate correlation between d2h-collagen and d18o-hap and moderate correlation between d2h-collagen and d15n-collagen.  conversion of d2h-collagen and d18o-hap to meteoric water values yielded a similarly moderate correlation with a d2h/d18o slope below 8, the expected value observed in meteoric water.  conversion to theoretical hydrogen isotope values free of trophic level influences resulted in a weak correlation with d15n-collagen, suggesting that direct trophic level enrichment/depletion is not controlling the disparity between expected and measured values.  the deviations are hypothetically caused by non-local food sources and a decoupling of expected d2h/d18o relationships as individuals consumed more meat and decreased in vivo non-essential amino acid production.
