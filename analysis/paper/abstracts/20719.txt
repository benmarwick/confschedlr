lagoa de obidos is an example of a decaying sea body that have influenced human occupation since, at least, the mesolithic period. in fact, in historical times, humankind has been fighting, and losing, against the natural disappearance of this body. this has led to the continuous adaptation of the local populations, and in fact reinventing innovative ways of cooperation with the environment. starting from harvesting resources in pre-historical times, to building maritime infrastructures in classical and medieval times, to present day maritime leisure touristic activities. our research stems from a crm project that spanned almost three years of research. within this project was done remote sensing, underwater archaeology, cultural and ethnographic studies, resulting in several interesting finds and a better understanding of this lagoon. we intend to present a journey into this area in its broader concept.  starting with its rich ethnographic material, following with historical knowledge and presenting the archaeological evidences that demonstrate its uses along the ages. the underlying understanding is that this environment led to an insular maritime culture, one of the many that add to the greater diversity of the portuguese maritime culture tapestry.
