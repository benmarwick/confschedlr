this paper presents the conclusion of my dissertation research using raman spectroscopy to student fire cracked rock (fcr) from earth ovens in south central north america. the bulk of information on what plant foods were processed in earth ovens comes from charred macrobotanical remains or microbotanicals such as starch and phytoliths. many geophytes commonly processed in earth ovens are not associated with microbotanicals, however, as their primary carbohydrate is inulin. raman spectroscopy is a technique commonly used in analytical chemistry to characterize molecules, and is explored here as a technique to look for inulin on fire cracked rock.

this paper presents the mixed results of raman analysis of the residue from fire cracked rock taken from archaeological sites the trans-pecos and edwards plateau in texas, as well as modern experimental ovens.
