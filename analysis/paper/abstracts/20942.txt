the three dimensional imaging of artifacts discovered at the los horcones site in southern chiapas mexico has enabled archaeologists to approach artifacts in a brand new way. with the use of a 3d scanner hardware and 3d program software, objects and features of various sizes are scanned to create a proportional and scale digital version. the scanning of artifacts allows for minimal handling of the objects decreasing the likelihood of wear, damage, deterioration, and contamination, effectively lending to conservation. this technology facilitates a full range of examination capabilities in a manipulable high resolution digital format that is easily transferrable and portable. in addition, digital formats enhance teaching pedagogy and public outreach. the potential of 3d scanning promotes a new kind of research that provides a practical interactive interface to websites, e-books, and research papers that contributes an entirely new dimension to responsive learning. furthermore, in conjunction with 3d printing, the data can be physically reproduced inexpensively and fairly quickly to provide a tangible object that can be used for a variety of research, educational, and demonstrative purposes.
