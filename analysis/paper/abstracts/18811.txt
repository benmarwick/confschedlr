this illustrated paper presents over ten years of early american research in virginia and maryland. it covers 12 pre-clovis sites, a summary of hundreds of pleistocene/early holocene artifacts, and relies on various professional papers on this topic. it discusses the change over from blade/core technology to biface/core technology around the younger-dryas geological event. the paper shows artifacts that have not been seen in the archaeological literature. several ongoing site investigations are shown showing volunteers. a prehistoric calendar is suggested which argues for a 10,000 years pleistocene occupation in virginia which starts with the now famous cinmar bipoint. there are six sites in the middle atlantic area with date around or older than 16,000 years.
