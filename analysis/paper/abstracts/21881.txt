textile production had a pivotal role among late postclassic societies including ancient tlaxcallan, a prominent altepetl of the puebla-tlaxcala region. several scholars have studied prehispanic cloth and garments production based on 16th century historical sources, but using little archaeological evidence. in particular, poor attention has been paid on the technology of textile production based on archaeological artifacts, especially in relation to spinning techniques and the different fibers exploited. in order to assess the technological characteristics of thread production in tlaxcallan, here we analyze a sample of 364 archaeological spindle whorls recovered at the site of tepeticpac, one of the main members of this political entity. by evaluating their mechanical performance, in association to different fiber processing techniques and thread qualities, we establish the existence of two large groups of archaeological whorls that are correlated with two spinning techniques. in addition, experimental analysis using replicas shows that it is possible to process a variety of short or long staple fibers with each spinning technique, and that artisans can choose the type of spindle whorl to use according to personal experience and skills.
