",Paleolithic,Other,Other,"The principle of equifinality describes a system where an end state may be reached from a variety of conditions and in a variety of ways and has proved to be a confounding element in several areas in archaeology. Archaeological data commonly occur in both qualitative and quantitative form and Bayesian modeling, coupled with modern computational routines, permits multiple data types to be incorporated into a single synthetic probability model. The Bayesian approach makes probability statements given observed data, constructing posterior probability statements about unknown model parameters including unknown (unobserved) data. 
Here we describe how Bayesian inference offers a solution to several areas relevant to archaeology. We use a Bayesian algorithm to make categorical assignments for unknown archaeological samples in three analytically similar contexts: identifying bone surface modifications, distinguishing between heated and untreated silcrete, and distinguishing the chemical signatures from discrete volcanic eruptions. In each example, we use large samples of observed reference data to train the respective models. Out-of-sample cross validation is then used to assess model performance and predictive ability before analyzing archaeological samples. Monitoring posterior distributions of unobserved data result an assignment of probability associated with individual unknown (archaeological) samples, thereby formally addressing the issue of equifinality.

",Neolithic,Zooarchaeology,Demography,"How do animal morphologies change during domestication? How do different parts of the skeleton adapt to human management? In this poster, I take a quantitative approach to domestication by comparing biometrical data from two species of mammals that were domesticated in the Middle East around the same time (ca. 8000 BC): pigs (Sus scrofa) and sheep (Ovis aries). Both pigs and sheep were domesticated by Pre-Pottery Neolithic B communities in northern Syria/southern Anatolia, but these species likely following different pathways to domestication as a result of their divergent behavioral and physiological properties. Using modern comparative biometrical data to guide the comparison, this poster tracks changes in cranial and postcranial measurements over time, covering the periods before and after domestication. By quantifying biometrical change across the skeletons of these two different species, this poster ultimately looks at mammal domestication as a process of unique adaptation to human cultural control.",Th-evening

Points accumulated in the archaeological record at stages from first use to extensively resharpened. Thus, specimens of a single type could enter the record in a range of sizes and shapes. Resharpening allometry has been documented in many studies, including geometric-morphometric (GM) ones. One hypothesis is that flintknappers designed points as separate “modules” to accommodate their overall function. This hypothesis views the base and blade portion of points as two modules of whole units, designed to perform different tasks and thus treated differently during the design and resharpening process. Using geomorph and the recently developed zooaRchGUI that exploits the functionality of R through a graphical user interface, we conducted  3D GM analyses of a set of experimental Folsom points as they passed through successive stages of use, damage, and repair. We report degree of allometric variation in both base and blade as a function in part of number of resharpening episodes , and changing patterns of integration within separate base and blade modules. Results are a step toward calibrating point size and shape to number or degree of resharpening episodes.",Th-evening

While it provides obvious nutritional and non-nutritional benefits, the choice to butcher an animal involves costs. These costs are primarily time, energy. Most research investigating these costs has focused on time alone. By creating ranking schemes using post-encounter return rates, researchers usually hypothesize which animals or body parts hunters should butcher. Yet, the energetic cost of butchery and its effects on these rankings remain unknown. To shed light on this problem, we measured the energetic and time costs of butchers during butchery of domestic sheep using stone tools. We used a heart rate monitor to measure the energetic expenditure for each segment of butchery while documenting time during the event, and verifying it by reviewing video recording. These data were analyzed using basic Heart rate variability techniques using the RHRV package (v. 4.2.3) of the R computing environment. Adding energetic cost, an important yet often omitted variable, to quantifying the butchery sequence provides a basis to better understand the costs and trade-offs of processing animals. These data are applicable to all archaeological events involving the human butchery of medium-to large-sized mammals.",Th-evening

Turkeys served as a critical resource for both subsistence and ritual uses. Yet, it remains uncertain at what scale (household, sub-community, or community) turkey management was organized. We develop cost-benefit models for the intensification of turkey husbandry, incorporating ethnographic and archaeological data with research into animal sciences on turkey raising.

",Neolithic,Zooarchaeology,Other,"Archaeologists investigate past hunting and herding strategies using models of animal survivorship derived from long bone fusion and/or mandibular tooth wear patterns. As biological and behavioral variation makes estimating precise biological ages problematic, researchers typically assign “age stages” that describe ranked age groups. Ordered logistic regression models take advantage of the information in these rankings to estimate and analyze patterns in ranked/ordered data based on other variables. This poster describes fitting ordered logistic regression models to zooarchaeological survivorship data using Bayesian inference (via Stan) to (a) estimate uncertainty in survivorship estimates due to sample size and (b) compare survivorship between different sites and sub-assemblages within sites. The model is also able to incorporate uncertain stage assignments using aoristic analysis; as most zooarchaeological assemblages contain specimens that cannot be assigned to a single “age stage”. The ability to use uncertain stages allows aoristic survivorship analyses to combine patterns of long bone fusion and mandibular tooth wear data, despite their variable specificity. The models shown here can be adapted to any archaeological situation that uses ordered or ranked variables.",Th-evening

Regardless of the outcomes of that process, these models were developed to help land managers make well-informed decisions and implement its multiple use mission, including managing for recreation, grazing, and oil and gas. Modeled site types include up to four prehistoric site types and two historic site types. Given available site data, certain site types are not modeled for all areas. Stepwise logistic regression is used to combine significant environmental variables to produce probability maps with values ranging from 0 (low) to 1 (high).

Using Individual-Based Models to Identify Out of Africa Hominin Dispersal Routes,"Africa: Northern Africa
",Paleolithic,Digital Archaeology: Simulation and Modeling,Migration,"There is a broad paleoanthropological consensus that hominins left Africa multiple times during the Pleistocene, but the geographic routes through which they exited the continent remains unclear. Although the Sinai Land Bridge and the Strait of Bab-al-Mandab on the southern end of the Red Sea are commonly implicated as the likely pathways used by early humans during their expansion out of Africa, the evidence supporting each route is still much debated. Here, we identify viable pathways for hominin dispersal from the Ethiopian-Afar basin toward the Sinai using Individual-Based Modeling (IBM) and computational statistics. We computed empirical probabilities for modern hunter-gatherers to occupy habitats with variable elevations, slopes, streamflow and Net Primary Productivities to input into our IBM. Results show that hominins could have followed multiple paths during their expansion out of the Ethiopian-Afar rift basins toward the Levant, including the western littoral of the Red Sea basin. This study sheds light on the geographic areas that may have facilitated hominin dispersal out of Africa, and lends support to the notion that coastal landscapes may have served as dispersal conduits during global expansion of hominins. Furthermore, the models identify key target areas for future survey.",Th-evening

A more recent adaptation led humans to transition from a foraging subsistence strategy to one based on farming. This is significant because foraging persisted for approximately 95% of human existence until farming emerged about 12,000 years ago. For nearly a century, anthropologists have studied the foraging-farming transition and proposed several hypotheses to explain its occurrence. Naturally, current research has prioritized ultimate explanations emphasizing long-term causality with limited research focusing on proximate explanations representing immediate causal mechanisms. This study evaluates the potential of “foraging risk” to have functioned as a proximate mechanism facilitating the transition to agriculture using a small sample within the North American Eastern Agriculture Complex, where independent domestication of numerous plants occurred during the Late Archaic period (4500-4000 BP). This study uses species distribution models, archaeological diet data, and paleoenvironmental proxies to reconstruct the paleoenvironment, assess the availability of prehistoric resources, and compare expected and observed diets. Results of this research lead to a better understanding of the effect of foraging risk on the independent development of and ultimate foraging-farming transition in North America.",Th-evening

This research addresses the first hurdle by developing a Logistic MERR approach to Distribution Regression. This method first samples a distribution of variable measurements from the spatial area of each site, then uses a kernel to project the distributions into a non-geographical feature space to calculate mean embeddings, finally Kernel Ridge Regression estimates similarity coefficients for inference and prediction. The primary benefits of the MERR approach to APM are the consideration of archaeological landform richness and variation, explicitly modeling similarity between sites and the environment, and allowing for similarity metrics specific to archaeological research questions. The second hurdle is addressed by applying the MERR method within a Bayesian framework for probabilistic modeling. As such, the uncertainty of data and parameters can be explicitly modeled with priors resulting in a posterior predictive distribution useful for quantifying and visualizing risk.",Th-evening

Studies of prehistoric hunter-gatherers have often made hypotheses regarding the effect of climate on foraging strategies, but have rarely tested those hypotheses. The absence of explicit hypothesis testing has been partly due to a dearth of operationalized paleoenvironmental variables. Although paleoenvironmental reconstructions have been abundant, particularly those based on pollen, they have mostly been qualitative descriptions. This study demonstrates the usefulness of modern paleoenvironmental reconstruction techniques to test evolutionary hypotheses about the magnitude and direction of climate on North American Paleoindian hunter-gatherers’ foraging behavior. I used pollen assemblages from across the North American Great Plains and neighboring regions to reconstruct multiple paleoenvironmental variables – mean annual temperature, annual temperature seasonality, annual precipitation, and annual precipitation seasonality. Using spatio-temporal statistics, this study estimated paleoenvironmental variables during the Paleoindian period and in areas across the Great Plains. The results have important implications for the understanding of Paleoindian foraging and subsistence within the context of paleoclimatic and nutritional resource reconstruction. Specifically, this study reconciles current hypotheses regarding the influence of climate and ecological change on Paleoindian dietary strategies and discusses its potential as a mechanism driving micro-evolutionary consequences.",Th-evening

These studies particularly rely upon well-preserved and highly visible remains, especially well-fired polychrome ceramics and monumental architecture. While Inca scholars have begun to analyze Inca hegemony in theoretically sophisticated ways that reveal how material culture legitimizes imperial rule, these approaches present several weaknesses: (1) sampling complications that can bias assessments of intensity; (2) insufficient consideration of the nature of Inca hegemony in diverse provincial settings; and (3) undue assumptions about the Inca heartland material assemblage to which provincial remains are compared. Because heartland sites have not been systematically reported in great numbers, we propose that more rigorous comparisons of horizontal excavations in the heartland are necessary for productively evaluating provincial contexts. Comparisons of Inca material signatures from recently-excavated heartland sites and one provincial site (Chao Valley) underpin our plea for more robust analyses of the nature of Inca hegemony. We further argue that rather than assess Incanization directed from center to periphery, we must acknowledge that the archaeological record was formed by local decisions and actions as much as by imperial policies.",Th-evening

Situated at the crossroads of the Quapaq Ñan running parallel to the Andean foothills and from the coast to the highlands, Sama Grande was assumed to direct people, animals, and goods across the region during the Late Horizon (14th-15th century AD). 
In 2017, full-coverage pedestrian survey of the coastal desert plain overlooking the middle Sama valley near the foothill zone (400-600 masl) revealed a wider Inca presence dating to the Late Horizon and early Colonial period in the form of architecture and other material culture. The predominance of Inca-Cusqueño and Inca-Altiplano ceramic styles, with an emphasis on depictions of llamas and ajíes (chili peppers), suggests that under Inca control the valley was principally used for camelid pasture and ají cultivation. 
These research results highlight the importance of the Sama valley, a previously unexplored area, within the broader regional network of Inca imperial presence on the far south coast of Peru, and add to current models of the transformative impacts of imperial strategies on local landscapes and resources.",Th-evening

Fieldwork conducted in 2016 included a geophysical survey of the area, photogrammetric documentation of the cutstones, topographic mapping of the site, and excavations. The excavations produced evidence of both large and small rectangular structures associated with the above-ground sculpted stones and outcrops, as well as an Inca midden. Subsequent analyses have focused on 3D spatial rendering of features identified, compositional study of the variety of Inca ceramics recovered using INAA, and comparative assessments.

This diversity reflects both the variability of Inca state interventions and independent enterprises working outside of the imperial political economy. Generally, state mining is evidenced by Inca-style architecture, including formal public spaces or plazas; social-aggregation practices for political ends; Inca-sponsored productive rituals; a functional differentiation in the spatial organization of the campsite (which also reflects social differences within the mining community); a focus on ore extraction rather than multicrafting; and a state-sponsored nonlocal provisioning of agricultural produce.
Yet simultaneously and intriguingly, some sites do not fit these parameters, and maintain a continuity with previous forms of mining exploitation. In some cases, such sites of typically small-scale mining represent the prevalence of local groups of aspiring elites that required a constant supply of sumptuary goods for their social differentiation. Thus, this presentation argues that these different mining modes represent the diversity of economic conditions during the Late Horizon in the distant provinces of the Inca empire.

Formed by a set of narrow temperate valleys, this region was a natural corridor that led to Apolo and the Mojos savannas to the north, and to the east to the tropical Yunga mountains. Because of its marked altitudinal variation, this region was suitable for pastoralism, the production of corn and coca, and farther east, the exploitation of gold mines. The Inkas at their arrival expanded dramatically the system of agrarian terraces along the set of valleys, and promoted the influx of a large contingent of mitmaqkuna colonies for farming and productive ends.

Cub Creek lies near the northern limit of maize cultivation in western North America in the foothills of the Uinta Mountain Range. We couple a Bayesian analysis of radiocarbon-dated pithouses and roasting features with a 2,115-year tree-ring reconstruction of August-July precipitation to explore relationships between Fremont subsistence and settlement strategies and climate variability. We propose a multi-stage model where the adoption of maize cultivation and development of pithouse hamlets was a response to regional drought ca. AD 500. Fremont subsistence and settlement reorganized during nearly a century of climate stability moving away from a focus on intensive maize cultivation and pithouse hamlets. During the Medieval Climate Anomaly, we suggest Cub Creek residents shifted strategies to a more foraging-dominated subsistence focus that still incorporated small-scale maize cultivation, but intensified collection of wild plant foods evident by numerous roasting features in the Cub Creek uplands. Our results challenge notions of regional abandonment and narratives of collapse and suggest that flexibility in subsistence options that strategically incorporated maize cultivation was a successful adaptation to climate variability.",Th-evening

We propose that strategies reducing variation in food production and institutions for protecting those strategies generate ever more complex socio-ecological systems (SES). The growth of complexity, accompanied by a loss in social and subsistence diversity, can result in major reorganizations due to external or internal changes that drive a SES across a critical threshold.  We explore this proposition using case-studies from the Great Basin, northern Chile and western Argentina. We compare radiocarbon SPDs with records of palaeoecological change, and changes in the diversity of subsistence and social strategies. The results show that population increased from 2000 to 800 BP in all three locations, and populations declined and societies reorganized between 700-550 BP.

At a global scale, the combination of effective temperature zones and aquatic resource availability is shown to condition broad patterns in the pace of intensification in a comparison of 14 archaeological sequences. Crop yield models using climatic, historical and archaeological data as inputs provide a framework for comparing changes in carrying capacity over time among archaeological cases from Latium (Italy), Kansai (Japan), and Oaxaca (Mexico). At a regional scale, a model of alternative agricultural strategies in the Maya Lowlands is used to predict which environmental variables explain regional variability in the rate and demographic thresholds of agricultural intensification.

Using formal mathematical models from macroeconomics, we examine the long-term variability of economies of scale in hunter-gatherer societies from southwest Wyoming throughout the Holocene. We compare means and variances in the scaling relationships between time-series datasets for population growth, social organization, housepits, ground stone, plant and faunal resources. These scaling relationships are then compared to paleoclimate records in order to investigate correlations between different economies of scale over time, population growth, and climate change. In particular, we investigate whether increasing variance in the underlying scaling of proxies for population, subsistence technology and social organization correlates with accelerating climate change and/or precedes major declines in prehistoric population.

In inland areas and particularly along desert oases, this phenomenon featured increasing complexity in food-production systems and sedentary lifestyles with population aggregating in architecturally complex villages. Whereas, littoral populations maintained marine foraging and fishing strategies with limited inland food-resources. Both lifestyles persisted up to the European conquest, which came on the heels of significant population decline throughout the entire continent. Here, we bring together paleoecological, archaeological and paleodemographic evidences to explicitly explore the role of past ENSO-induced climate changes in determining spatial convergences/divergences in demographic trajectories, temporal continuities/discontinuities in resource exploitation (i.e subsistence-strategy), and technological/cultural innovations of Atacama Prehispanic populations. Results show that over the previous three millennia these societies underwent important centennial-scale demographic fluctuations. As agrarian and foraging strategies are highly sensitive to water availability and ecosystem productivity in this arid bioclimate, both coastal and inland groups experienced boom-bust cycles. Changes observed during the last 3.5 ka BP correlate with variations in the activity/intensity of ENSO, a major driver for modern bioproductivity and variations in hydroclimate.

Next, we use a large sample of radiocarbon dates to estimate changes in energy consumption by human societies over the last 8,000 years in Utah.

We observe correlations between these proxies in relationship to the paleoecology of the region. We expect an stronger increased in radiocarbon frequency  (SPD) in “northern farming areas” than in “southern hunter-gatherer” areas. In the other hands, a decline of radiocarbon date density will start around ca. 500 years BP in all areas but more abrupt could be recorded in “northern farming areas”. This drop in density is discussed in relationship with LIA climatic pattern. In term of human diet, we expect decreasing diversity as the SPD curve approaches its peak and then “collapses”.

Assessing territoriality with human strontium data is facilitated by determining the strontium ratios in the local geology. While it is common to obtain strontium isotope ratios from geologic regions through plants or substrate, they tend to show heterogeneity in a given area. Strontium ratios from animal skeletal tissue, known as bioavailable strontium, are more homogenous because they provide an average of an area.

This poster presents the results of applying this methodology to a range of geographic regions during the Late Holocene. Using archaeological, historical and agricultural data from the Seshat Databank we are able to reconstruct the long-term carrying capacity of 30 diverse geographic regions spanning the globe. Carrying capacity is reconstructed on the basis of either the chief staple carbohydrate source or, for pastoral societies, on the availability of biomass. We demonstrate how agricultural intensification affected the carrying capacity of each region, in many cases correlating with the development of complex societies.

A Western European Case Study,Europe: Western Europe,Other,Other,Environment and Climate ,"Humans, like any other organism, must continuously adapt to or modify their surrounding environment to maximize their fitness. One of the main sources of environmental variation that humans must cope with is climate variation. Adjustment to climate variation may include increasing investments in infrastructure (social, technological, cognitive) which acts as a buffer, filtering out the effects of higher frequency climate variation on the ability of individuals and populations to consume energy, and thus maximize an individual’s fitness or the mean fitness of a population. As investments in infrastructure increase, social complexity increases, and higher frequency climate signals (such as annual temperature or precipitation) should become increasingly more out of phase with annual energy consumption (representing a social output). Using energy consumption levels and climate data from Western Europe over the last 400 years, we evaluate this idea that increases in infrastructure increasingly buffered the energy consumption dynamics of populations from high frequency climate variations. The results of our analysis are important for developing a general theory of human responses to climate change that can be applied to archaeological case studies.",Th-evening

Hunter-gatherer groups living in the Texas Coastal Plain developed complex and stable human-resource systems that utilized a variety of habitats across the Coastal, Riverine, and Inland Zones.

In this presentation, we discuss our evolving methodology and the resulting three-dimensional models and orthomosaics, along with implications for future uses of these techniques. The applied methodology highlights the potential of this emerging technology to rapidly document and assess site features when on-site time is limited.  We also discuss issues related to processing, affected by proprietary software availability and computer memory capacity, especially for building models while in the field.  High-precision technology applied to document surface architecture and fragile rock art on the mountains and plains of western North America in the last decade has focused on establishing regularized patterns of domestic life and distributions of resources across the broader social landscape. Layering in three-dimensional models produced using hundreds of photographs from a DSLR camera further directs these efforts and re-defines expectations for archaeological interpretations, especially in cultural heritage and preservation dialogues.",Th-evening

The maturity of existing software environments such as Unity additionally allows for integrating spatial analysis tools into immersive environments, boosting archaeological research. We present the results of recent field work at the ancient Maya site of Cahal Pech, located in the Belize Valley of west-central Belize. We used a range of environmental sensing technologies, 3D modeling (e.g., structure from motion mapping and hands-on modeling) and 360° photography/videography of architecture to create an immersive experience for Cahal Pech (for an overview see: http://sites.psu.edu/archaeology/). Importantly, we developed a field protocol that could be implemented at other archaeological sites to allow researchers to view, interact with, and analyze data both on and off-site immersively.

The project, initiated by the Tribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO), Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI), involves an effort to repair a vandalized petroglyph panel. The rock art panel is a complex composition of incised, interwoven petroglyphs from which a 1.5 m section was removed and carried off-site. The removed section was recently returned to the EBCI, and it was decided that an effort should be made to restore the panel to it's original location. Photogrammetric 3D reconstruction was selected as the best method to non-invasively model repair efforts, and also provided a unique opportunity to study the petroglyph forms, and provide the basis for an interactive experience for members of the EBCI community.

The Spanish colonists brought with them both food traditions from Europe, and from Mexico, where they had been inhabitants for generations.  In New Mexico, the food traditions that the colonists brought with them blended with native food traditions, thus producing the “New Mexican cuisine.”  By analyzing the macrobotanical remains from LA 20,000, I will attempt to understand how the identity of the site inhabitants developed through food.  The first step will be to attempt to reconstruct the cuisine at LA 20,000 by using a combination of macrobotanical archaeological data and historical data.

Ultimately, the results illustrate clear changes within local plant communities corresponding to Spanish settlement and long-term environmental trends not visible in site-specific samples. More pronounced environmental changes occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries, suggesting the impacts of colonial population growth and increased grazing.

However, the goals of the missionaries and their skewed demography made for distinct relationships with the Pueblo peoples among whom they lived. In New Mexico, colonists’ households were another important location of cultural interaction, one that came with different goals, demography, and power relations. Exchanges of information between Spanish colonists and indigenous groups were critical to the survival of the colony as indigenous peoples’ labor and knowledge were useful for basic subsistence activities. This session explores one such household at the Sanchez Site (LA 20,000), a 17th-century Spanish ranch in northern New Mexico.

Ryan-Harley is significant because it is the only archaeological site in the Southeast United States where diagnostic Suwannee material has been recovered in-situ within a discrete geological layer through extensive excavations. A broad faunal assemblage interpreted as dietary remains was also recovered from the same stratigraphic layer as the Suwannee material. Taxa identified include extinct Pleistocene species such as tapir, horse, giant tortoise, and muskrat.This association relatively dates Ryan-Harley to the terminal Pleistocene, most likely between 10,900 14C yr B.P. to ~10,500 14C yr B.P. The association of lithic and faunal material at the site is critical to the interpretation and proposed age of the site. We examine this association through fabric and spatial analyses of artifacts and faunal material recovered at the Ryan-Harley site to test the null hypothesis that the site represents an intact Suwannee campsite. We compare how cultural material accumulates due to post-depositional processes with how intact archaeological deposits are oriented in space to determine which case compares most favorably to the lithic and faunal material at Ryan-Harley.

Florida State University houses human skeletal remains from four archaeological sites in St. Augustine, Florida (8SA36-7, 8SA7-6, B28L1and B42L1) which were originally excavated and analyzed in the 1970s. This study aims to utilize modern techniques and technology to revisit this previously examined material. Through a reassessment of the established biological profiles and noted pathologies, this study will create an updated and shareable digital catalogue/inventory of materials including individual demographics, osteometric data, associated photographs, field notes, and previous research. These remains, sites, and the work that accompanies them are not only part of the history of Florida, but a history of FSU and the Department of Anthropology. This project not only serves to update and proof established osteological data, but also to digitize data and associated information for preservation and conservation purposes.",Th-evening

At the same time, Southeastern archaeology is challenging due to poor organic preservation, poor separation of components, poor site visibility, and modern site destruction from looting, development, and sea level rise. Further, much of the early cultural record was submerged offshore by the more than 130m of sea level rise from ca. 21,000-5,000 years ago, meaning that we know little about how early people may have used the coasts. Therefore, new methods of modeling and analysis hold great promise for mitigating these challenges and providing insight about how past Southeasterners lived and adapted to their changing worlds. The archaeologists in this session ask new questions of curated assemblages, analyze and interpret materials from recent excavations, and use new methods and techniques to shed light on some of Southeastern archaeology's most enduring problems.",Th-evening
