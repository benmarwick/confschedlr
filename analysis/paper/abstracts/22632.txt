in a 1995 study of the chronological patterning of elko series and split-stemmed projectile points, bryan hockett concluded that neither type entirely matches the patterns of the bonneville or lahontan basins; and the neither area represents good chronological analogues for northeastern nevada.  dart points recently found in the well dated context of a stratified open site in the northern goshute valley exhibit characteristics of both early side-notched and corner-notched types. comparison of these points those found in early archaic contexts in the bonneville basin and other regions suggest that many of them may have been routinely misidentified as elko series points and not an earlier transitional point type.  in this paper, we propose a new temporally diagnostic projectile point type and explore the implications that the identification of what we term "pequop points" may have on the refinement of great basin chronology and on the long and short debate.
