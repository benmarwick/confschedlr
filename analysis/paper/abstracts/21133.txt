performing mock excavations of human skeletal material is a common practice throughout undergraduate and graduate studies in forensic and bioarchaeological programs. these class sessions include instruction on correct excavation methods, mapping techniques, documentation methods, and chain of custody. inevitably however, there are differences between mock excavations within a class setting and active homicide excavations where no professor is present and the real-life ramifications of the students’ actions are dramatic. instead of practicing for a grade, the student must aid in the deliverance of justice for the victim and work well with law enforcement while professionally executing what they’ve practiced in school. the goal of this presentation is to discuss real-life experiences of an active homicide excavation in comparison to how mock excavations are traditionally taught. we hope to offer insight from a student perspective to help current and future educators develop effective methods of teaching mock excavations and to prepare students for what a real excavation may entail.
