the archaeology of landscapes and cities produces large quantities of data that presents a challenge to visualization. libraries of procedural scripts or “rules” can help to streamline the process of modeling built environments and their topographical contexts, by identifying typical elements that can be adapted to empirical data through the modification of parameters. one of the advantages of procedural modeling as opposed to other types of archaeological visualization is that it allows for the rapid prototyping of many different iterative versions of a model, thereby allowing researchers to test different theories and present many different hypotheses side by side. a second advantage is the ability to connect, line by line, the code or “rules” that generate the models with source data and process documentation. this paper presents projects that use procedural methodology for archaeological reconstruction of cities, landscapes, and individual buildings.
