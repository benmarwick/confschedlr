data derived from oxygen isotope profiles of mussel shells suggest that sites in the interior of santa cruz island dating between 4700 and 3400 cal bc, the period of the island’s “red abalone middens,” were occupied during the spring through early winter, with little or no occupation during the main winter months. in contrast, a small number of oxygen isotope profiles indicates that a large costal site was occupied predominantly during the winter and possibly also the fall, with no occupation from late spring through early summer. floral and faunal remains obtained from another large coastal site, as well as characteristics of its deposits, suggest occupation from late spring through early fall and possibly occupation during winter months. although data are still scanty, small groups of island occupants appear to have occupied sites in the island’s interior during the warm seasons of the year, when various plant food resources would have been available, and also aggregated at a coastal site for acquisition of marine resources. aggregation also occurred at another coastal site during winter months not only for acquisition of marine resources but also for various social activities.
