numerous archaeological studies of european-native american interaction in the americas during the colonial and historic eras focus on the processes by which native american households and communities procured and adopted (or resisted the adoption of) european technologies and material culture. comparatively few studies have addressed instances in which non-native households incorporated native american technologies and material culture. recent archaeological investigations in tempe and phoenix, arizona, show that many non-native households procured and used native american pottery during the late 1800s and early 1900s, including undecorated pots designed for domestic use. some pots might have been obtained as souvenirs or art pieces, but the majority appear to have been obtained for utilitarian purposes, indicating a clear recognition and appreciation of the technical qualities of native american-made pottery among many non-native households. examinations of the ceramics and their recovery contexts, in conjunction with a review of the historic record, help clarify the technical attributes, chronology, ethnic affiliations, and the social and economic contexts in which non-native households adopted and used these native american technologies.
