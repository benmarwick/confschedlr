the middle east and north africa are home to spectacular archaeological sites from palaeolithic flint scatters to great post-antique cities; the archaeological heritage of this region is under increasing threat from massive and sustained population increases, agricultural development, urban expansion, warfare, and looting. the endangered archaeology in the middle east & north africa (eamena) project is supported by the arcadia fund and the cultural protection fund, based at the universities of oxford, durham, and leicester. the project uses satellite imagery to record and interpret archaeological sites and landscapes that are under threat across this region. this paper will provide an update on progress of the eamena project, including preliminary results, as well as discussing its future direction. it will review the challenges and successes of the project over the past three years and discuss our current training initiatives. it will outline how we are working to facilitate the uptake of the eamena database as a long-term record for the mena countries, to assist with improving the protection of the cultural heritage in the region. by working with local archaeologists and other interested parties we aim to share information and skills, to strengthen networks and raise awareness.
