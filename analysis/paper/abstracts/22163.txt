since 2015 archaeology centre at the university of toronto has offered a successful week long summer archaeology program for high school students. the program has combined fieldwork with lectures, seminars, visits to heritage institutions, and hands-on workshops to create a well-rounded overview of the field of archaeological practice. the program was originally spearheaded by two undergraduate students, and through the years has not only served to introduce high school aged youth to the fields of archaeology and cultural heritage, but also to provide undergraduate archaeology students with an opportunity to practice public engagement. in our presentation, we will analyse the challenges and triumphs of creating a successful outreach program, examine the benefits of teaching archaeological skills to youth, and explore future applications of youth engagement in archaeology.
