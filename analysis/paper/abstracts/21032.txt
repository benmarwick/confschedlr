numerous paleoclimate proxies indicate the little ice age caused marked declines in new zealand’s atmospheric and sea surface temperatures for much of the period between 1450 c.e. and the end of the nineteenth century. these trends could have keenly affected the productivity of marine fisheries, which have always been critically important to maori, the indigenous peoples of new zealand. considering the close connections that continue to exist between traditional fisheries and maori economic, social, and spiritual life, it is likely that any changes in fish populations would have had wide-ranging effects on people’s lives in the past. in this paper, i explore the ways that studying the top-down effects of climate change on traditional maori fisheries shed light on developments in pre-colonial maori history, and present preliminary results for the analysis of archaeological fishbone assemblages from the northern north island, new zealand.
