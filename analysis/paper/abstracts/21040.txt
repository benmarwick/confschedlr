this paper presents pollen data as a proxy of past vegetation at poverty point, a large archaic mound site in northeast louisiana. the paleoecological focus of this presentation revolves around the rate and nature of change over time. patterns and changes in taxonomic diversity are presented and discussed in light of environmental productivity. the rate of vegetation change is calculated and related to ecosystem stability. additionally, changes in individual taxonomic representation are examined to determine if change over time occurs piecemeal or to entire plant communities. such findings will be related to the impact of vegetation change on people and the role of anthropogenic change in shaping the local environment.
