one persistent social and economic phenomena seems to span human history. whether capital, feudal, social or other, no productive system has managed absent the abuse of its laboring class. specifically, each mode of production required, in one form or another, a large body of unemployed or underemployed, peripatetic laborers. currently, immigrant workers occupy this precarious position in the united states and elsewhere. before the great depression hobo’s crisscrossed the road and rail ways of the u.s., taking up temporary jobs before moving on to a new location. in europe and parts of asia, the roma have a long history of this kind of movement and economic activity. rarely do archaeologists consider these groups in our excavations and subsequent analysis and publications. our work tends to glamorize the urban spaces which have attracted large populations across time. yet, these peripatetic workers were every bit as essential to the development and maintenance of such spaces as those who dwelled and labored within them. this paper details the potential for an archaeology of transience and focuses on an excavation of a hobo camp outside of a small quarry town in south-central pennsylvania.
