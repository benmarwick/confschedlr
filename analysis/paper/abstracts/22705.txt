i present my completed thesis research hypothesizing that the chronology and culture of the prehistoric occupation in beef basin is reflected in ceramics and architecture. beef basin is located west of monticello, utah and south of canyonlands national park. archaeologically it is located within the fluid boundary space between the ancestral puebloan and fremont archaeological cultures. although there has been a surge of recent research in the north periphery of the ancestral puebloan area, recent research in beef basin remains sparse. my research provides the first in-depth analysis, including neutron activation analysis, of ceramics from this region. my data set includes ceramics analyzed in the field as well as from the archaeological collection at the natural history museum of utah. i discuss the results of my ceramic and architectural analysis within the context of the late pueblo ii period chaco proliferation.
