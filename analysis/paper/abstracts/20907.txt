during the late classic period (a.d. 600-800), maya non-royal elites frequently appeared in courtly scenes, which are depicted on polychrome vessels and carved monuments. while epigraphic studies over the last two decades have gradually shed light on their political and ritual roles, little is known about their life histories and mortuary practices. one group of these elites held the title of lakam, which has been reported only at three archaeological sites. we detected tangible evidence of their residential cluster at the archaeological site of el palmar, located in southeastern campeche, mexico. a hieroglyphic stairway found at el palmar’s northern guzmán group depicts the genealogical list of lakam elites. during the 2016 field season, 10 burials were recovered at the guzmán group and subsequently subjected to osteological analyses to document their biological profiles and life histories. by combining the osteological results with archaeological and epigraphic data, we attempt to reveal socio-political circumstances of these relatively unknown elites in classic maya society.
