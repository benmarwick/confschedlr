we present the discovery of a new middle magdalenian site at enval, a rock shelter site in the massif central of france. radiocarbon dates indicate a tight chronology at 17,000 years ago. the site is significant for several reasons. faunal elements indicate the site is largely intact and not a palimpsest. faunal studies also indicate the site was occupied during the winter. this is important because it demonstrates that late pleistocene humans occupied the massif central during harsh conditions. lithic artifacts indicate far ranging contacts from hundreds of kilometers in multiple directions. many items of personal adornment and mobilary art were also recovered.
