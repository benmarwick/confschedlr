Woodpecker Cave is a Late Woodland rockshelter site used by the University of Iowa as a field school for student education. The site was first excavated by Warren W.

In the subsequent years since the university first began excavations in 2012 with Jim Enloe as supervisor, students have expanded the excavation area horizontally leading to portions of levels being excavated throughout different years. The site is excavated in arbitrary ten centimeter levels below datum. To present, each year’s faunal assemblage has been examined by a succession of students for annual reports submitted to the Army Corps of Engineers (CoE). For research purposes, we have chosen to look at level five, excavated during three different seasons, because it appears to have coherent spatial structure, anchored by a hearth with different tasks indicated by distributions of various classes of artifacts. This analysis combines several years’ collections of animal bones from level five to give an integrated, coherent faunal assemblage.

Faunal indices vary significantly in response to El Niño-based precipitation and SST, with substantial moisture-driven variability in the middle and late Holocene. The late Holocene moisture pulse is coincident with previously documented changes in the population dynamics of other vertebrates, including humans. These results will contribute to formulating and refining hypotheses regarding human settlement and habitation of the Baja California peninsula through the Holocene.

","Bronze Age","Bioarchaeology/Skeletal Analysis","Pastoralism","Extensive bioarchaeological research has addressed questions about stress, pathology, and activity in agricultural and semi-agricultural populations throughout the archaeological record, yet comparable studies pertaining to nomadic pastoral and semi-pastoral groups are relatively rare. During the Bronze Age in the Eurasian Steppes, archaeological evidence suggests a transition of lifeways from semi-sedentary agricultural to nomadic pastoralist. Entheseal analyses in bioarchaeology introduce an exciting avenue to ask new questions about the physical effects these lifeways have on those who practice them. This study aims to investigate the extent of entheseal changes among Bronze and Early Iron Age populations in Mongolia as both sedentary and pastoral groups were contemporaneous. Entheses of the upper and lower limbs were scored for 54 individuals dating from the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. Scores between and within the two periods were compared and entheseal differences between sexes, age, body size, and site location were analyzed. The goal of this study is to answer if there are differences between the two periods and which factors influence the differences.",8,"Matthew_Fuka","Th-morning"

Thus, this research compares Roman and Langobard populations from late antiquity to the medieval period using stable isotope analysis on bone collagen, apatite, and tooth enamel for 78 human individuals and 10 faunal remains to investigate diet in the Veneto. The results indicate variations in diet within and between the populations. The late antiquity sites are more consistent with a C3 plant diet with some marine and terrestrial animal contributions, while the Langobard sites are varied. This study shows that in late antiquity people in the Veneto still relied on a traditional Roman diet of fish and C3 resources after the fall of the Western Roman Empire; however, the incoming Langobards show variation in their utilization of resources, with some consuming more of a C4 diet with millet.

The obsidian from the source appears as nodules of variable sizes and very good quality for the manufacture of tools. The nodules are part of a conglomerate that corresponds to the geological formation Agua de la piedra (Oligocene). In this paper, we present the spatial distribution of the source, the variety of the macroscopic characteristics of the raw material and current trends in the archaeological record. Seventeen samples were analyzed by INAA and XRF by the Achaeometry Laboratory at MURR. The results indicate that the Coche Quemado source has a different geochemical signal than all other sources in the region.",5,"Laura_Salgán","Th-morning"

Does the chemical signature of the residue accurately reflect the meal(s) cooked in that pot? Seven archaeologist-cooks each prepared a distinct recipe, in the same ceramic (un-glazed) pot, once a week for a year, and periodically sampled the charred residues for stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. During the final weeks, the cooks swapped recipes to see if the final meal would “over-write” the previous year’s cooking events, or if the chemical signature of those earlier meals would be retained. Our isotopic data show a consistent relationship to each recipe’s ingredients. However, the isotopic data from the final residue collection indicate the charred material was not only from the last recipe cooked but retained material from earlier cooking events.

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.

To better understand these animals’ subsistence practices, we present the first results from a study of plant microfossils (pollen, phytoliths, starch granules, etc.) recovered from their intestinal contents and desiccated fecal material. Through these data, we can begin to address questions regarding the plant taxa consumed, the ecological zone(s) in which these animals ranged just prior to their deaths, and the potential variability of these parameters across the population and through time. We also examine the taphonomic effects of digestive processes on the plant spectrum present in the intestinal versus fecal samples.",2,"Michelle_Elliott","Th-morning"

The presence/absence of cortex is often linked to reduction intensity with variable cortical frequencies linked to early or late stage reduction and potentially reflective of residential mobility. However, we lack reliable markers or values to support our interpretations. Recently, Harold Dibble (and others) have proposed a method for evaluating assemblage cortex by comparing observed and expected frequencies. These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility. This paper applies the method developed by Dibble and others to the lithic assemblage from the Beaucoup site (24PH188/189) in northern Montana, a Late Prehistoric site with spatially distinct kill, processing, and residential areas. The lithic raw materials found in the assemblage (particularly quartzites) occur on-site and, as a result raw material size, shape, and origins are known. Our preliminary examination of cortex patterns indicates spatial differences between the areas of the site which may reflect variations in residential mobility.

They are termed the “Neolithization processes.” Changes include the advent of food production and sedentism, and the adoption of pottery and ground stones. However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes.

Previous chronometric work has shown an age difference between the Clovis assemblage (represented by two antler rod samples), dated to ~11,000 BP by XAD-purified collagen, and the Anzick-1 individual, dated to ~10,700 BP by XAD-purified collagen. The discrepancy between the age of the human remains and the osseous artifacts has led to much speculation. Here, we present the results of a comprehensive radiocarbon dating program that utilized different preparative chemistry methods on osseous material from the site, including a single-amino acid extraction protocol using preparative High Performance Liquid Chromatography (prep-HPLC) optimized at the University of Oxford. This comparative approach has allowed us to obtain robust chronometric data for a key site in First Americans research.",6,"Lorena_Becerra-Valdivia","Th-afternoon"

The Tlajinga district is located along the southern Street of the Dead and was a possible entrance for migrants and visitors to the densely populated urban center of Teotihuacan during the Classic Period. Ceramic evidence suggests this district was occupied during the height of the city from the Early Tlamimilolpa period (A.D. 170 – 250) until the collapse of the city in the Metepec period (A.D. 550 – 650). With over 30 14C dates with measurement errors below ±25 14C yr from both human bone and charcoal specimens, Tlajinga is now one of the most dated districts at Teotihuacan. Combining high precision dating with ceramic evidence and utilizing the Oxcal Bayesian framework, this project explores the rise and decline of Teotihuacan’s southern neighborhoods providing insights for apartment compound construction events and population dynamics during the apogee of the city’s occupation.

The Terminal Formative included the emergence of an urban center at the site of Río Viejo, which may have extended political influence over surrounding communities. During this period, on the coast of Oaxaca, ceramic figurines were a ubiquitous medium for expression and identity in political/cultural exchanges. By comparing ceramic figurines from the site of Rio Viejo, a primary center, to Cerro de la Virgen, a secondary community, relations between these two communities can be better understood. Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses, including INAA, much can be postulated about the manufacture and use of the ceramic figurines. The figurines from both sites have proven to be diverse in their iconography as well as sharing many other aesthetic similarities. With Terminal Formative figurines here some iconographic trends that seem to exist as categories such as anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, which are expressed by a number of well-preserved artifacts.

Seven archaeologist-cooks each prepared a distinct recipe, in the same ceramic (un-glazed) pot, once a week for a year, and periodically sampled the charred residues for stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. During the final weeks, the cooks swapped recipes to see if the final meal would “over-write” the previous year’s cooking events, or if the chemical signature of those earlier meals would be retained. Our isotopic data show a consistent relationship to each recipe’s ingredients.

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.

Researchers used portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) technology to sample the elemental content of over 500 round balls from more than 17 different archaeological sites in eastern North America. These include samples from Native American and Euro-American settlements as well as French and Indian War, Revolutionary War, Indian Wars and War of 1812 sites. These preliminary data demonstrate that Antimony (Sb) and Tin (Sn) are very important elements for measuring differences in round balls. One goal is to elevate the diagnostic value of round ball ammunition so that we can determine where the lead came from, who was firing the bullets, and how did access to lead vary over time. The pXRF information shows promise in identifying additives or contaminants introduced and military association. If combined with element data from lead ore sources, baseline information can be developed for comparison among battlefield assemblages and incorporated into a global dataset with the purpose of better understanding the geographic distribution of military supplies and military strategy at macro global and regional levels.",4,"Daniel_Elliott","Th-afternoon"

These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility. This paper applies the method developed by Dibble and others to the lithic assemblage from the Beaucoup site (24PH188/189) in northern Montana, a Late Prehistoric site with spatially distinct kill, processing, and residential areas. The lithic raw materials found in the assemblage (particularly quartzites) occur on-site and, as a result raw material size, shape, and origins are known. Our preliminary examination of cortex patterns indicates spatial differences between the areas of the site which may reflect variations in residential mobility.

","Neolithic","Ceramic Analysis","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers","Archaeologists suggest that during the transitions between the Pleistocene and the Holocene, drastic changes occurred in the lifeways of humanity. They are termed the “Neolithization processes.” Changes include the advent of food production and sedentism, and the adoption of pottery and ground stones. However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes.

Using the cetacean comparative and reference collection at the Smithsonian Institution’s Museum Support Center, the small cetacean remains have been identified. Species composition and abundance data are compared with modern stranding data to help elucidate whether small cetaceans were actively hunted or if stranded animals were scavenged. Additionally, the small cetacean data from Seaside will be placed into the broader context of small cetacean exploitation in the northeastern Pacific Ocean and compared to data from other archaeological sites. This allows for a temporal and spatial analysis of small cetacean species abundances and distributions in the region. This data is also compared to herring data of the northeastern Pacific, a common food source of small cetaceans, to note if there is a possible correlation between the two.",12,"Hope_Loiselle","Sa-morning"

This research explores the utility of applying ubiquity as a quantitative analysis method to shellfish assemblages from a variety of archaeological sites in Barkley Sound, British Columbia. We observe a high commonality of occurrence for ‘rare’ species including gooseneck barnacles, abalone, limpets, chitons, and sea urchins and note many of these taxa are susceptible to fragmentation and differential preservation. We apply these ‘regularity of use’ measures across bulk sample assemblages and site types and identify varying levels of ubiquity that provide new insight into ethnographic and ecological records.

As such, it provides a unique opportunity to analyze the debitage produced during the Elko manufacturing process and the spatial distribution of artifacts at this type of site. It is also presumed that the points were produced by the same individual or individuals and discarded at the same time. Therefore, an analysis to identify the morphological variability or continuity within the Elko series point type at a given point in time can also be performed.",9,"S. Joey_LaValley","Sa-morning"

The nearest obsidian sources are hundreds of miles away, and local chert can be highly variable in quality and availability. Monterey chert, common to both the northern Channel Islands and the adjacent mainland, varies widely in terms of inclusions, color, and consistency; Franciscan chert from the mainland is similarly troublesome for tool-makers on a large scale. In spite of this, the Chumash and their ancestors utilized these materials for more than 10 millennia to manufacture finely worked bifaces; late in prehistory they also developed sophisticated specialized microlithic tools for shell bead production. Most research in the region has focused on these craft products while omitting the critical role played by widely available but poor quality toolstone. I evaluate the use of low quality local materials in this context, arguing that patterns of lithic production on Santa Cruz Island responded more strongly to cultural norms than to the functional properties of specific toolstones.

In Bioanthropology, migration is often perceived in oversimplified terms. Researchers seek to determine if an individual or group migrated, and when in their lifetime this occurred. Furthermore, many scholars treat diversity in equally simplified terms. Traditionally, individuals are assigned to an ancestral population of “best fit,” despite claims that this practice is unreliable. Migration and diversity are complex, intertwined elements of the human experience and must be approached in tandem using multidisciplinary methods.   
This poster outlines the methods available to examine past migration and identifies ways to incorporate them with evidence of diversity. Scientific approaches, i.e. biodistance and isotopic analyses, will be combined with cultural approaches, i.e. the study of material goods and funerary accounts of diversity, and literary approaches, which document native Roman and migrant opinions. These methods will be applied to case studies from imperial Rome, which was characterized by diverse communities as a result of frequent conquest and large-scale population movements. The outcome will establish if this integrated approach allows for greater insight into the experiences of migrating and host communities.",8,"Sarah_Poniros","Sa-morning"

Ceramic evidence suggests this district was occupied during the height of the city from the Early Tlamimilolpa period (A.D. 170 – 250) until the collapse of the city in the Metepec period (A.D. 550 – 650). With over 30 14C dates with measurement errors below ±25 14C yr from both human bone and charcoal specimens, Tlajinga is now one of the most dated districts at Teotihuacan. Combining high precision dating with ceramic evidence and utilizing the Oxcal Bayesian framework, this project explores the rise and decline of Teotihuacan’s southern neighborhoods providing insights for apartment compound construction events and population dynamics during the apogee of the city’s occupation.

Complicating the construction of a chronology for the site is the difficulty in using conventional ceramic typologies at Pueblo IV and early Colonial Pueblo sites in southern New Mexico. While the Rio Grande Glaze Ware sequence has chronological utility for sites in northern New Mexico, the chronological associations of the ware are much less secure for sites in southern New Mexico.

We test these apparent correlations through a multifaceted study of nearly a dozen burial mound assemblages from across northern peninsular Florida, seeking to infer patterns of human mobility, social interaction and community formation in the context of mortuary rituals. Isotopic analysis of skeletal populations are combined with demographic and life history information from individual secondary interments to model patterns of diet and mobility.

The Terminal Formative included the emergence of an urban center at the site of Río Viejo, which may have extended political influence over surrounding communities. During this period, on the coast of Oaxaca, ceramic figurines were a ubiquitous medium for expression and identity in political/cultural exchanges. By comparing ceramic figurines from the site of Rio Viejo, a primary center, to Cerro de la Virgen, a secondary community, relations between these two communities can be better understood. Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses, including INAA, much can be postulated about the manufacture and use of the ceramic figurines. The figurines from both sites have proven to be diverse in their iconography as well as sharing many other aesthetic similarities. With Terminal Formative figurines here some iconographic trends that seem to exist as categories such as anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, which are expressed by a number of well-preserved artifacts.

Seven archaeologist-cooks each prepared a distinct recipe, in the same ceramic (un-glazed) pot, once a week for a year, and periodically sampled the charred residues for stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. During the final weeks, the cooks swapped recipes to see if the final meal would “over-write” the previous year’s cooking events, or if the chemical signature of those earlier meals would be retained. Our isotopic data show a consistent relationship to each recipe’s ingredients.

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.

Recently, Harold Dibble (and others) have proposed a method for evaluating assemblage cortex by comparing observed and expected frequencies. These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility.

","Neolithic","Ceramic Analysis","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers","Archaeologists suggest that during the transitions between the Pleistocene and the Holocene, drastic changes occurred in the lifeways of humanity. They are termed the “Neolithization processes.” Changes include the advent of food production and sedentism, and the adoption of pottery and ground stones. However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes. Our results add new understanding to our previous results on the timings of technological, behavioral, and paleoenvironmental changes.

CT scans densities of substances and allows analysis of substance surfaces and internal structure. Limitations include separating adjacent substances with similar densities. CT-scanning images for instance reveal tree rings of the coffins, mattress materials, different layers of textiles, and metal artefacts covered by fabrics. In our enquiries we have also micro-CT-scanned individual textiles from archaeological contexts. Micro-CT-scanning enables detailed study of textile structures and sewing patterns. Individually scanned items include caps and knitted products with multiple textile layers that otherwise could not be studied without breaking the items.

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.

The analysis of charcoal remains from three different features corresponding to large hearth remains sheds light on practices of firewood gathering and usage.

The presence/absence of cortex is often linked to reduction intensity with variable cortical frequencies linked to early or late stage reduction and potentially reflective of residential mobility. However, we lack reliable markers or values to support our interpretations. Recently, Harold Dibble (and others) have proposed a method for evaluating assemblage cortex by comparing observed and expected frequencies. These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility. This paper applies the method developed by Dibble and others to the lithic assemblage from the Beaucoup site (24PH188/189) in northern Montana, a Late Prehistoric site with spatially distinct kill, processing, and residential areas. The lithic raw materials found in the assemblage (particularly quartzites) occur on-site and, as a result raw material size, shape, and origins are known. Our preliminary examination of cortex patterns indicates spatial differences between the areas of the site which may reflect variations in residential mobility.

They are termed the “Neolithization processes.” Changes include the advent of food production and sedentism, and the adoption of pottery and ground stones. However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes.

","Intermediate Area","Lithic Analysis","Craft Production","The “axe-god” jade pendants form the majority of Costa Rican jade artifacts. These pendants were valued for their “celt like shape” and did not function as real axes. Interestingly, some pendants do have abrasions on their axe edges. Because of that, it has been proposed that prior to being reworked into a corporal accessory, some of these pendants had been used as real axes or other tools. The “axe-god” pendants consist of two parts; the superior part with decoration of human or animals, and the inferior part presents undecorated axe. This unique shape of “axe-god” is also can be seen in gold, bone, and shell artifacts in Costa Rica. Hence, the inferior part of the axe pendants may have important symbolic meaning, and focusing on the axe part is of great significance. Both the crafting procedures and the basic form from which the pendant is shaped are closely related to the pendants usage. In this study, a digital microscope was used to analyze use-wear and crafting techniques. As a result, I show that there were several ways to elaborate the “axe-god” possibly reflecting a variety of crafting groups.",10,"Waka_Kuboyama","Fr-morning"

This study presents the results of a comparative multi-year analysis of high and low power micro-usewear and residue patterns on 14,000-10,000 cal BP unifacial stone tools from the late Pleistocene archaeological sites of Huaca Prieta on the north coast of Peru and the Monte Verde I and II sites in south-central Chile. The archaeological stones from these sites are also compared with experimental assemblages employing various actions (e.g., scraping, cutting, gouging, perforating) to work several types of materials ranging from hard and soft plants to animal hide and meat to fish and shellfish, among others.  The analyzed tools are contextualized within the specific activity areas where they were recovered within sites. The contribution of these results to the broader inter-assemblage interpretation of the sites is discussed.

St. Joseph’s Hospital was established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1902 as a tuberculosis sanitarium for well-heeled clients to rest and recuperate in what was then thought of as one of the healthiest cities in the United States. Sanitariums like St. Joseph were established throughout the New Mexico territory to attract more wealthy individuals to settle the territory and finally make their bid for statehood stick. Initial analysis of skeletal, dental, and funerary data seems to partially contradict this model that has held for the role sanitariums played in late territorial New Mexico. Of the individuals, whose dental morphology could be analyzed most (5/8) were of Hispanic ancestry, and at least two individuals (2/8) were of African American ancestry. Coffin hardware and funerary artifacts were uniform and indicative of middle or lower-middle class socioeconomic status. These data suggest a more nuanced view of tuberculosis treatment during the late territorial period.",7,"William_Marquardt","Fr-morning"

CT scans densities of substances and allows analysis of substance surfaces and internal structure. Limitations include separating adjacent substances with similar densities. CT-scanning images for instance reveal tree rings of the coffins, mattress materials, different layers of textiles, and metal artefacts covered by fabrics. In our enquiries we have also micro-CT-scanned individual textiles from archaeological contexts. Micro-CT-scanning enables detailed study of textile structures and sewing patterns. Individually scanned items include caps and knitted products with multiple textile layers that otherwise could not be studied without breaking the items. The greatest benefit of this method is the undestructive research that allows to peek inside textile structures and coffins.",5,"Sanna_Lipkin","Fr-morning"

These deposits contain production debitage from most phases of blade-core reduction but no nodules and relatively very little cortex, suggesting that obsidian came into Cotzumalguapa as prepared cores. Within the deposit cores occur in low frequencies and when found are generally nearly exhausted. The presence of both a primary prismatic blade-core and a secondary but significant bifacial and unifacial projectile point industry are indicated by both the debitage and the finished and near finished artifacts discarded in the obsidian dumps.

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.  This study hopes to test each these dynamics through the nondestructive analysis of ceramics excavated from Machu Llacta using a Bruker Tracer Vi handheld pXRF unit.

The analysis of charcoal remains from three different features corresponding to large hearth remains sheds light on practices of firewood gathering and usage.

The presence/absence of cortex is often linked to reduction intensity with variable cortical frequencies linked to early or late stage reduction and potentially reflective of residential mobility. However, we lack reliable markers or values to support our interpretations. Recently, Harold Dibble (and others) have proposed a method for evaluating assemblage cortex by comparing observed and expected frequencies. These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility. This paper applies the method developed by Dibble and others to the lithic assemblage from the Beaucoup site (24PH188/189) in northern Montana, a Late Prehistoric site with spatially distinct kill, processing, and residential areas. The lithic raw materials found in the assemblage (particularly quartzites) occur on-site and, as a result raw material size, shape, and origins are known. Our preliminary examination of cortex patterns indicates spatial differences between the areas of the site which may reflect variations in residential mobility.

They are termed the “Neolithization processes.” Changes include the advent of food production and sedentism, and the adoption of pottery and ground stones. However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes.

The Terminal Formative included the emergence of an urban center at the site of Río Viejo, which may have extended political influence over surrounding communities. During this period, on the coast of Oaxaca, ceramic figurines were a ubiquitous medium for expression and identity in political/cultural exchanges. By comparing ceramic figurines from the site of Rio Viejo, a primary center, to Cerro de la Virgen, a secondary community, relations between these two communities can be better understood. Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses, including INAA, much can be postulated about the manufacture and use of the ceramic figurines. The figurines from both sites have proven to be diverse in their iconography as well as sharing many other aesthetic similarities. With Terminal Formative figurines here some iconographic trends that seem to exist as categories such as anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, which are expressed by a number of well-preserved artifacts.

Seven archaeologist-cooks each prepared a distinct recipe, in the same ceramic (un-glazed) pot, once a week for a year, and periodically sampled the charred residues for stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. During the final weeks, the cooks swapped recipes to see if the final meal would “over-write” the previous year’s cooking events, or if the chemical signature of those earlier meals would be retained. Our isotopic data show a consistent relationship to each recipe’s ingredients.

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.

However, we lack reliable markers or values to support our interpretations. Recently, Harold Dibble (and others) have proposed a method for evaluating assemblage cortex by comparing observed and expected frequencies. These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility.

The lithic raw materials found in the assemblage (particularly quartzites) occur on-site and, as a result raw material size, shape, and origins are known.

In contrast, Maya Hak Cab Pek and Saki Tzul, are both located in the interior of the Maya Mountains. They have intact deposits from Cal.12,000 to 1,100 BP.  Despite varying degrees of bone fragmentation, the analysis of the deposits from all three rockshelters during these early periods of human occupation provides a unique insight human subsistence choices and food processing.  Our precise chronologies are anchored by over 100 precise AMS dates, giving us a high-resolution view into animal exploitation by pre-agricultural hunting and foraging societies in the Central American tropics",1,"Asia_Alsgaard","Fr-afternoon"

The aim of the research is to gain knowledge about hunter-gatherer landscape use during the Holocene and to incorporate the basin within a broader discussion of the population of the western side of Southern Patagonia. Different altitudinal sectors along an East-West axis -from the steppe to the forest- were surveyed in order to  understand seasonal mobility: 1) the coast of the lake (255-300 masl), 2) pampas (300-700 masl)-, large open spaces formed by glacial deposits-, 3) basaltic plateaus basis (750 masl), and 4) the plateaus (950-1000 masl). Lithic artifactual densities are evaluated considering local geomorphology, new data on chronology, technology, rock art and guanaco (Lama guanicoe) archaeofauna. All these data is framed on a regional hunter-gatherer landscape use model that is compared to the ones built for neighbour lake basins like the Tar-San Martín (to the north) and Argentino (to the south).",1,"Juan_Belardi","Fr-afternoon"

In 2011 we carried an intense salvage archaeological excavation program along the central area of Strait of Magellan in Southernmost Patagonia, Chile. Here we present the results obtained from 1.546 m2 of excavation, where a total of 18 archaeological sites, located along the eastern shore of the Brunswick Peninsula (south of Punta Arenas), were rescued. The excavations have generated an important archaeological assemblage of materials that provide significant information regarding the human occupations of this region between c. 2500 years BP and the XVIII century. 
This study assesses the general characteristics of the occupations in this region, and discusses their technological components (bone and lithic instruments) and the faunal resources exploited. The results obtained are then compared with previous studies in this region.  These data are used to discuss the intensity of human occupation in the area, and the role of marine and terrestrial fauna in the subsistence strategies of the maritime nomads from Southernmost Patagonia during the Late Holocene.",1,"Manuel J._San Román","Fr-afternoon"

Collections from these sites are currently housed at the Division of Anthropology AMNH, and were recently analyzed as part of the activities of Grant FONDECYT 1140939.
The sites are located in Tierra del Fuego and the Navarino islands (east and west of the Beagle channel respectively). These sites, Rockshelter 1, 2 and 3, are large shell middens associated with rock shelters. Lithic and bone technology information from the collections is presented and assessed. Data collected from the assemblages is compared to the records and the scarce information of these archaeological sites extant today. The results provide a general overview of archaeological marine hunter-gatherers, highlight the importance of raw materials among them, and further inform about their distinctive technological traits during the second half of the Late Holocene.

","Neolithic","Ceramic Analysis","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers","Archaeologists suggest that during the transitions between the Pleistocene and the Holocene, drastic changes occurred in the lifeways of humanity. They are termed the “Neolithization processes.” Changes include the advent of food production and sedentism, and the adoption of pottery and ground stones. However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes. Our results add new understanding to our previous results on the timings of technological, behavioral, and paleoenvironmental changes.

","Contact Period","Survey","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers","Much of the archaeological research done in the interior deserts of Australia has focused on rockshelter sites, primarily because of intact stratigraphy and better preservation than in open air contexts. However, ethnographic studies of local Martu populations have demonstrated that people rarely lived in rockshelters or caves, particularly during the wet season when populations focused around reliable soaks and clay pans. Therefore, it is necessary to study the distribution of archaeological sites and cultural materials in open air contexts to fully understand settlement patterns. During the 2017 field season, we conducted a systematic survey of the Wuukurta Clay Pan region in Karlamilyi National Park, less than a day’s walk west of the present-day Parnngurr aboriginal community. The cultural landscape surrounding the main soak contains extensive groundstone and lithics, with the highest densities of cultural materials at the edge of the soak and two clay pans. Seasonally available water and subsistence resources attracted people to the region and provided the potential to support wet season population aggregation. This poster shows the distribution of cultural materials in Wuukurta and demonstrates the archaeological research potential of open air contexts in understudied desert environments.",1,"Christopher_Jazwa","Fr-afternoon"
