the city-state of minanha, located in west central belize, reached its zenith and most culturally complex stage by the late classic period, 675-810 ad. only a century later, its royal court had “collapsed”. contreras valley is a small farming community in the settlement region of minanha. decades of research at minanha and the analysis of artifact frequencies from commoner households allows for a better understanding of the the intra- and inter-community social practices occurring at the site of contreras valley and within the greater minanha area. a community archaeology framework is utilized to explore the integrative social, political, and economic strategies of this commoner population. this framework allows for a peripheral perspective on the “rise” and “fall” of the royal court, providing a more holistic analysis of minanha’s history. as contreras valley was able to sustain a population whilst its royal court disintegrated, the resilience of this group of individuals will generate an increased cognizance of how a community copes with and continues to thrive in a climate of political chaos and instability.
