museums and their exhibitions are representations of archaeological research. archaeological excavations, associated objects, and subsequent interpretations frequently end up in museums and are often the only access the general public has to this knowledge. how objects are acquired, cared for, and presented ultimately affect what people learn about them in a museum setting. it is crucial for museums and museum professionals to maintain standard practices and care for these objects to the best of their ability with the resources they have available. 

our work at the dockyard museum in antigua focuses on the difficulties and the potential for proper curation and care of unique archaeological artifacts while keeping a narrative the public is attracted to. our project focused on rejuvenating the museum’s displays, but through this process we realized the necessity for professional archaeologists to understand how curation and narrative at a museum have lasting implications on the archaeological record. this presentation highlights the history and current state of the dockyard museum while addressing how the care and display of archaeological materials affects the interpretation and preservation of the archaeological record.
