this presentation examines traditional, contemporary, and experimental methods of illustration and photography in rock art recording. addressed accordingly are the processes and problems unique to pictographic (painted) and petroglyphic (pecked) parietal imagery, superimposition and dating. as a rock art researcher, photographer, and artist, many examples will be drawn from my fieldwork; specifically contemporary methods utilizing panoramic photography and an experimental photographic technique employing solarization filters. the presentation concludes with a discussion of how the act of hand-drawing rock art images creates a powerful scenario to intimately connect with the acts of past agents, as well as the potential opportunity to envision more dynamic interpretive frameworks in rock art studies.
