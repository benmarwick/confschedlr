Such a record is particularly important in tropical settings that contain some of the most threatened terrestrial ecosystems in the world today. However, poor preservation and assumed human avoidance have meant that past records of human behaviour have been patchy for these biomes. Here, I review how new methodologies and archaeological interest has enriched datasets of human tropical forest use from the Pleistocene to the historical period. Alongside growing information relating to palaeoenvironmental fluctuations in different tropical regions, I seek to demonstrate that these datasets have much to offer modern conservation and policy-making in tropical regions. From documented millennia of tropical forest hunting, gathering, and burning alteration by hunter-gatherers to agricultural and urban populations surviving and collapsing through significant periods of climate change, I argue that a resource already exists for helping to understand problems facing human populations in tropical landscapes today.

Legacies of earlier generations of anthropological scholarship encourage researchers to assume particular traits of sociopolitical organization. Archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence from the Cuzco region of Peru demonstrates how such assumptions can be an obstacle to developing accurate representations of social organization.  As Inca elites extended power in the Cuzco region (AD 1200-1400), they interacted with diverse societies that did not all resemble the monolithic Andean ayllu. One compelling case for reconsidering ayllu organization is Yunkaray, seat of the powerful Ayarmaca polity, located near Maras, 35 km northwest of Cuzco.

This paper uses ethnohistory, regional settlement patterns, and excavation results from Yunkaray to note divergences from classic ayllu attributes. We identify camelid herding as a potentially integrative force in pre-Inca community formation, and examine the public performance of community identity in relation to Yunkaray’s neighboring polities. We trace the enduring Yunkaray community through its sociopolitical apogee and the subsequent forced resettlement of its residents by the Incas. Finally, we consider how the imagined community of Ayarmacas relates to local ayllus that coalesced in the early Colonial period, especially through processes of Spanish resettlement.",2993,"Symposium","Presenter","Kylie_Quave",3,11,3,"Fr-afternoon",1

The site provides important data on the history of human occupation of desert environments during the Late Pleistocene. One central question is if the observed diachronic pattern of occupation is largely driven by climatic change, as often assumed, or if other factors such as adaptation processes play significant roles. Based on the assumption that survival in the often unpredictable environments of SE Arabia requires increased behavioral flexibility and risk minimizing strategies this paper examines Jebel Faya’s Paleolithic stone artifact assemblages with regard to economization of lithic raw material and the intensification of social relations. Attributes such as production efficiency and re-use potential represent raw material economization, while technological complexity, occupation intensity and raw material provisioning are used to deduce an indirect estimate for the intensity of social relations. To assess the degree of economization and social relation, the archaeological assemblages are compared to data modeled under optimality assumption using a probabilistic approach based on Naïve Bayes classifier.

","Historic","Digital Archaeology: GIS","Historical Archaeology","Caribbean Sugar production during the 18th and 19th centuries expanded rapidly, fueled by increasing proletariat consumption across the globe.  In response, sugar planters in 18th century Antigua, West Indies, deforested over 90 percent of the landscape, carving the island into proto-industrialized plantations defined by sugarcane monoculture and labored by enslaved Africans. New World plantation organization was once ascribed as a balance between profit and surveillance: simultaneously maximizing control over the landscape and enslaved labor.  However, evidence from Antigua questions aspects of these earlier notions.  This paper examines the socio-spatiality of the late 18th century Antiguan plantationscape. Specifically, this research builds upon the analysis of Bates (2015) in Jamaica and Nevis, conducting a diachronic and synchronic analysis of seven different plantations in Antigua owned by the Codrington family, including Betty’s Hope [1655-1944], New Works [before 1710], Cotton Estate [before 1710], Tuitts Estate [before 1750], Rooms Estate [1717-1852], Clare Hall [1814-1848 (at least)], Jennings Estate [1772-1815], and Bolans Estate [1772-1815] to determine whether plantation layout sought to maximize profit or surveillance.

However, an investigation of the ritual practices of the center along with the spatial differentiation of gender-specific activities within the larger site reveals some of the distinguishing features of Late Moche ideologies of sex and complementarity.

By including interdisciplinary data from across Mesoamerica, we seek to facilitate a comparative discussion on the reliance of coastal populations on aquatic versus agricultural resources. Researchers have found that Mesoamerican societies were more likely to depend on marine and estuarine fauna such as fish and shellfish before the Late Formative, when growing populations often moved inland. Such scholars assert that alluvial settings contained fertile soils with a higher surplus potential than estuarine habitats.  Challenging this view, other scholars stress the abundance and protein values of estuarine species. We will problematize this debate through three overlapping topics. First, to what extent have disciplinary biases underemphasized coastal productivity and settlement (c.f. Erlandson and Fitzpatrick 2006)? Second, are these biases linked to the obfuscation of coastal land use evidence via environmental changes (e.g., sea level rise or hurricanes)? Third, what potential factors contributed to variation in subsistence and settlement on Mesoamerican coasts?

","Paleolithic","Lithic Analysis","Landscape Archaeology","Abundant surface scatters of Middle Stone Age artifacts are found throughout northern Malawi, eroding from remnant alluvial fan deposits (Chitimwe Beds). Surface surveys documenting these areas have guided the emplacement of 50+ archaeological test pits and excavations, many of which have yielded in situ MSA sites.  However, the surficial evidence itself has been subject to less discussion and merits closer attention. At the Bruce site, surface artifacts were identified as part of an assemblage originally excavated in 1965, but which has since undergone significant disturbance from local development. Recent excavation and surface collecting by archaeologists has had an additional impact on the site. Bruce contrasts with localities like the similarly aged White Whale, ~40km to the south, where surface finds evidence a well-preserved knapping surface exposed by erosion near a cliff edge, that nevertheless retains spatial integrity. We use these case studies to discuss assumptions associated with surface finds, the role and influence of archaeological research on the integrity of surface and subsurface assemblages, and the relative stability of archaeological landscapes. Finally, we examine the potential for assessing landscapes modified by agrarianism—which may obscure or erase surficial archaeological materials—using declassified CORONA satellite imagery collected from 1959 to 1972.",3047,"Symposium","Presenter","Sheila_Nightingale",2.75,9,2.75,"Fr-afternoon",24

In this paper, we address a long intractable issue for Lower Illinois Valley (LIV) mortuary archaeology, in a region that anchored Dr. Goldstein’s long and productive career. While Middle Woodland (Hopewell) and late Late Woodland mounded tumuli are well represented in the archaeological record, not so for cemeteries from the several intervening centuries. Relying on data from the archaeological record, primarily radiocarbon dates, variation in cemetery structure, mound location, and material culture, we address this issue. Possible explanations range from the simple, depopulation and regional cultural discontinuity, to nuanced, complex interpretations of funerary activities and interment facilities from throughout the Middle and Late Woodland periods. Our perspectives are also enhanced through the judicious use of ethnographic and ethnohistoric sources.

But not all memories are treated the same or are even chosen to be remembered. My own experiences as an archaeologist living in a modest-sized, rust-belt city for nearly two decades has exposed the never-ending rush of “progress” to erase the past. At both my research sites and my home, I see communities harmed by the trauma of forced erasure of the past – forced forgetting. As landmarks, parks, homesteads, and factories that were once the backdrop of many people’s lives are destroyed, communities experience the disorientation and dislocation of memory. The demolition of the past is usually coated with a veneer of newness and the promise of better times ahead. But what trauma becomes embedded in the landscape once communities lose their physical connection to their past and their identities?  What burdens are placed on those who are left to do the work of remembering? I propose that “traumascapes” are created in the violence of gentrification.

","Other","Other","Resilience and Sustainability","The pluvial conditions during the African Humid Period of the Early-to-Mid Holocene profoundly influenced environments across northern and eastern Africa, expanding lakes, rivers, and grassland ecologies. Archaeologists have often explained human responses to these increasingly aquatic environment as in terms of an increasing reliance on fisher-hunter-gatherer economies. Similarly, once the AHP ended, humans abandoned these lifeways. These perspectives are overly deterministic; in this paper, we approach this problem by adapting a Resilience Theory framework to examine a (type site?) case-site on the Lothagam-Lokam site near Lake Turkana, Kenya. New excavations at Lothagam-Lokam have uncovered a sequence of small-scale local environmental shifts with interstratified cultural horizons that spans the entire Holocene. We argue that people’s decisions to intensify or re-organize their economic strategies shaped their options and cultural attitudes in responding to subsequent stresses when faced with small-scale environmental fluctuations around Turkana. The interconnected cultural and economic systems gradually assembled through multiple resilience cycles ultimately conditioned responses to more extreme events such as the 60 m drop in Turkana’s lake level at the end of the AHP. Our application of Resilience Theory at Lokam provides a potential path forward for more nuanced discussions of human-environment interactions during the AHP.",3055,"Symposium","Presenter","Steven_Goldstein",2.5,9,2.5,"Fr-afternoon",28

","Other","Other","Landscape Archaeology","This paper approaches Silk Road-scapes as imagined topographies, a particular inheritance of the medieval culture of travel, and of its representations of the world(s). How we imagine ‘Silk Road’ landscape is therefore rooted in assumptions about categories and conditions of agency (social and historical), and about space. These include mobility, transcendence, and visibility—both in the landscape and in the record. Travel and cosmopolitan encounters along roads (Silk or otherwise) are chrono-topoi (spacetimes) which structure our historically-situated regard of spaces, such as mountain valleys and expansive deserts. 
Working in local landscapes of medieval Armenia, I problematize the idea of Silk Road space, thinking not only about mobility and contact, but also about spaces of care, hospitality, and comfort. Critical to the theme of this session, these spaces and practices are gendered, embodied, they depend on vulnerable spacetimes and ‘quotidian’ actors, as well as particular ideas of ‘culture’ and ‘nature.’ In this paper I will explore how picking at the gendered structuring of Silk Road narratives both requires that we deploy archaeological data in different ways, and also leads to larger-scale untanglings of understandings about large-scale exchange, culture ‘contact’ and the distinctions between pre-modern and modern worlds.
