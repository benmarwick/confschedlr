a pilot study was conducted to test the feasibility of applying strontium isotope analysis to source the 
origins of archaeological “canoe trees” tested to make --- pre-contact dugout canoes spanning some 
5000 years. many canoes collected decades ago from florida’s lakes produced unexpected signatures. 
these results raised further questions about the methods feasibility and the impact of past preservation 
approaches to the curation of waterlogged wooden artifacts. the anatomical nature of wood cells from
legacy samples along with modern proxies was analyzed and experiments indicate the highly hygroscopic 
nature of wooden log boats/dugouts/canoe trees. new considerations regarding these “wooden sponges”
and the potential preservation/conservation for these unique waterlogged remains and the isotopic 
research will be the focus of this presentation.
