Tools produced are characterized by flake-core reduction strategies. The combined visual characteristics of the source material and technology employed are important chronological indicators. But, general similarities in the appearance of the raw material and factors such as variable thickness create the potential for overlap with other sources, such as Pico de Orizaba, though the latter tends to have fewer inclusions, making it more suitable for the production of prismatic blades than Guadalupe Victoria obsidian. Thus, the presence of clear-to-light-gray material in flake form is typically assigned to the Guadalupe Victoria source, whereas clear-to-light-gray material in blade form is often attributed to Pico de Orizaba. The presence of clear-to-light gray material in flake form throughout the occupational sequence of Pre-Classic and Classic period Matacanela challenged existing ideas about the efficacy of visual designation.

Paisley Caves, Oregon, established itself as one such early human habitation site when human DNA was found in coprolites dating to the oldest associated with humans in America. In addition, the sediments within caves at the site contain an abundance of well-preserved pollen.

Namely, large-scale animal sacrifice rituals within the city acted as a new mechanism for distributing meat to the masses, provided by centralized authorities. The increased scale of animal sacrifice in the nascent city would have created new meanings to these rites and led to a new demand for meat in public spaces. While transhumance and larger herds had been used for meat production in central Italy before the Archaic Period, urbanization would have shifted the supply chain towards a reliance on animals raised outside the city.

Results indicate that the Preclassic (1000 BC-AD 300) Maya of western Belize had diverse diets incorporating both maize and wild foods, which may have promoted resilience in the face of social reorganization and changing ecological systems at the end of the Preclassic period. During the Classic period (AD 300-900/1000), inter-individual isotopic variations indicate that high-status individuals had a narrow and highly specialized maize-based diet, which may have created a more vulnerable socio-economic system that disintegrated due in part to drought conditions during the Terminal Classic period.

This project is a collaboration between an archaeologist and two professional mathematicians, with the goal of building a mathematically rigorous model for sexing ancient prints.

A scan of a print provides a high-resolution representation, akin to a digital elevation map of the topography of the print, including ridge patterns, overall size, shape, and depression depth.

Explicitly or not, most researchers use their own bodily experiences of movement as analogies for making inferences about the material and sensory consequences of bodily movements in the past. As imitative learning produces shared embodied knowledge among craftspeople, likewise, archaeologists can engage with movements and materials to produce some degree of intersubjectivity with bodies in the past. Drawing from archaeological and ethnographic fieldwork in western Ireland, this paper will propose simple guiding premises for undertaking a sensory archaeology of movement.

After emancipation, indentured laborers lived and worked within the same physical plantation landscapes as the enslaved individuals who came before them.
