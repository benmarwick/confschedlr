the paleo crossing (33me274) clovis site in northeast ohio was discovered in 1989, and excavated in the early 1990s.  analysis of the collections over the past 27 years has shed light on clovis technology, mobility, raw material transport, and forager colonization behavior.  now, armed with several new questions involving the site's chronology, clovis tool function, and the possible presence of a clovis "structure", we re-opened excavations at the site during june 2017.  while more excavations will take place during summer 2018, this presentation serves as an preliminary report on new discoveries at this unique and fascinating clovis site.
