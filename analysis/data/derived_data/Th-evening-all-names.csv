Such examples of retainer sacrifice, also mentioned for Aztec kings and documented in Maya tombs, raise questions about slavery, violence, and subjectivity. David Graeber has argued that slavery played a key role in the origin of commercial systems. The transition at issue concerns the melding of human economies (which make and remake relations between people) with commercial economies (which concern the acquisition of goods and wealth). Social currencies power human economies, but such money can never substitute for a person because each person and their relations are unique. Sufficient violence, however, can reduce a person to mere property, a slave. In a well-known passage from Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel states that the bondsman (the slave) has no consciousness of own: his/her essential nature is to live for the lord. Some aspects of captives and human sacrifice in the new world accord well with Graeber‚Äôs and Hegel‚Äôs position, yet there are salient differences.

War captives, orphans, and forced and enslaved sexual servants from the lower classes, Maya slaves and their possession became by the late Postclassic and early colonial period the major source of wealth and power of the traditional Maya Nobility.  Divorced from control over specified traditional patrimonial landholdings (which many recent scholars have shown did not exist for the precontact Yucatec Maya), and alientated from most other sources of wealth, Maya slaves and forced servitude became transformed into the most important system of patrimonial wealth and power for the Maya nobility.  This paper will examine the political economy of Postclassic Maya slavery, its scale, nature and cultural practices in an attempt to understand the political and economic impact of indigenous slavery, and the continued role that Maya slaves and slavery played in the early development of the conquest credit system that led to the financing of the expeditions of conquest organized by the conqueror Francisco de Montejo and his family in Yucatan (1527-1545).",Electronic Symposium,Presenter,John_Chuchiak IV,2.25,8,2.25,Th-evening

In opposition of the larger villages along the White Water Rivers (at the Amazon or Madeira rivers), in the uplands the dispersed pattern surely existed to make best use of the soils. Therefore, we propose that the geometric earthworks are statements of power within the regional societies, made by people with similar cultural understanding.

The native Amazonian population built an anthropogenic landscape through the creation of causeways, well or ponds away from rivers, raised fields, earthworks, large settlement mounds, Amazonian dark Earth soils and anthropogenic forest. When the Europeans arrived in the Americas, large and diverse groups of people with extensive networks of communication and hierarchical social-political organization had developed across the Amazon, and they had been constantly manipulating and managing the landscape to meet their everyday needs.

Controversy surrounds interpretations, owing to incongruities between archaeological and textual data as well as disagreements over how to weight the disparate observations made in these documents. Modern researchers variably evaluate the biases, motives, and the overall truthfulness of the authors of these documents. Another issue is the general subjectivity involved in fitting non-systematic observations into pre-existing anthropological models; usually some support can be found for almost any position. This presentation will attempt to address some of these issues by applying a formulaic approach to the weighting of document subject matter. While there is still subjectivity involved in the method, it provides a consistent and replicable means of evaluating the importance of different themes in a text. These themes can then be interpreted to infer both biases of the author and the relative significance of observations regarding Indigenous social organization. A trial attempt at this approach supports many pre-existing interpretations but also suggests some of the topics previously identified as paramount in the social organization of Contact era Sonora are of secondary importance.

The Rio Chama valley was a population center with 12 villages housing thousands of people at the beginning of the fifteenth century. By century‚Äôs end it was nearly devoid of full-time habitation. The timing and causes of the protohistoric ‚Äòabandonment‚Äô of the Chama has sparked interest from archaeologists and historians. Was this movement out of the Chama the continuation of a centuries-long process of Pueblo coalescence, or rather a response to early Spanish contact and colonization? The latter idea is bolstered by the fact that the Chama is the ancestral homeland of Ohkay Owingeh where Governor O√±ate established the first capitol of New Mexico in 1598. 

I reframe this debate by assuming that the Chama was never abandoned. Based on archaeological, historic, and ethnographic documentation the Chama remains the heart of Ohkay Owingeh‚Äôs cosmography, and was visited and occupied throughout the Historic period.

Ethical anthropologists in North America recognize that they need to secure tribal/First Nations permission for their research.  Sometimes permission is granted only for projects of interest to the tribes themselves. And sometimes publication of that research for a wider audience may be restricted or denied. But the benefits of collaboration result in a much richer understanding of Native and non-Native relations, one informed and shaped by the perspectives of Native people themselves.
 The Hopi Tribe of Arizona has been insisting on such collaboration for decades now. Nonetheless, some scholars working on the Hopi people continue to ignore such ethical guidelines and understandings.  We argue that Southwestern archaeology, cultural anthropology, and ethnohistory will never progress beyond the limitations of Western epistemologies and lines of evidence biased by Western ethnocentrism and silences until collaboration is embraced and institutionalized as the only ethical and productive way to understand our shared pasts and presents. We discuss Moquis and Kastiilam: The Hopi History Project as one example of such collaboration.

For the colonial period in Sonora, historians and anthropologists have mostly relied upon archival documents written by representatives of the Spanish empire, in addition to information from historical archaeology. The Comcaac knowledge immersed in oral traditions balances some of the inherent biases in the Spanish documentary record, and sheds light on aspects of their history where the documents are mute. Initially we describe Comcaac historical accounts about the ‚ÄúCazoopin‚Äù (Spaniards) that mention first encounters with Spanish sailing ships and their opportunistic adoption of Spanish material culture. We then discuss the relevance of place and routes among the different historical narratives. To finalize with a discussion on how, both Comcaac oral accounts and the documentary record, provide ample descriptions of leaders. It is argued that the importance of Comcaac masculine war leaders is a cultural practice similar in some respects to Spanish and Western emphases on prominent individuals.

It critically focuses on previous classificatory systems of Olmec deities. Iconographers often identify individual deities on the basis of defining attributes or material accoutrements, frequently extending these identifications across contexts (as in Covarrubias‚Äô famous ‚Äúevolution of the Mesoamerican rain god‚Äù). However, building in part on Eva Hunt‚Äôs work, we find that the conflation or sharing of attributes among Formative period entities casts doubt on the validity of classificatory schemes that fail to adequately consider the fluidity of deities or their relationship to that which they personify. This ‚Äúconceptual overlap‚Äù in Olmec art may lead to confusion, misidentification, or overly simplistic interpretations. It is argued that the construction of deity systems should consider such conceptual overlaps in representational art, in order to more fully unpack the multiple, non‚Äìhierarchical levels of significance imbricated in images of gods and supernaturals, as well as the dynamism of such representations within larger symbolic complexes. A range of data from various contexts are considered in an effort to evaluate the utility of cross‚Äìcultural analogies in comparative iconography.",Symposium,Presenter,Joshua_Englehardt,3.5,12,3.5,Th-evening

Rather than setting Epi-Olmec apart from more robustly-defined predecessors, neighbors, and successors, this paper will use Epi-Olmec visual culture to inform upon them.

Quetzalcoatl and Classic Veracruz,Mesoamerica: Gulf Coast,Other,Iconography and Epigraphy,"Ideology, Ontology, and Memory","Great is the conflation of Ehecatl Quetzalcoatl and Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl: a mythical player in the world creation of Mesoamerican groups vs. a semi-historical personage who presaged the arrival of Hern√°n Cort√©s. Veracruz, a region implicated via the activities of both avatars, is particularly enmeshed in this duality.

The Postclassic narrative whereby Quetzalcoatl journeyed to the Gulf lowlands appears to be foreshadowed in the desacralization of Teotihuacan‚Äôs Feathered Serpent Pyramid at the end of the third century AD. This ritual destruction has been linked to a political realignment at Teotihuacan, instigating the departure of refugee groups who fled the Basin of Mexico.

The founding of Classic Period Matacapan, in the Tuxtla Mountains of southern Veracruz, may have been linked to this exodus. This paper considers the regional impact of this relocation via the appearance of Quetzalcoatl imagery along the Veracruz lowlands, both through overt representations as well as potential proxies (e.g., Reptile Eye glyph, Venus symbolism, the ehecacozcatl ‚Äúwind jewel‚Äù). Variations in how Feathered Serpent imagery is manifest could well reflect autochthonous lowland ideals versus notions related to an intrusive highland cosmovision. Thus, not all Quetzalcoatl imagery is equal, nor is it equally unfettered.

As costume elements, these sculptures would have allowed actors to assume the identity of captives, rulers, or deities. This accords well with iconographic evidence of ballgame-related ritual performances in Veracruz, and suggests comparisons with artworks from other Mesoamerican cultures, in which rulers impersonate deities in performances associated with the ballgame. In this paper, I suggest that deity impersonation and performance are productive lenses through which to interpret ballgame-related sculpture, including yokes, hachas, and palmas. I examine a corpus of stone sculpture from Classic-period Veracruz, considering how such sculpture may have been used to invoke the presence of specific deities, and what it can tell us about the role of those deities in Veracruz culture.

While systematic studies of gods and rites have a long established history elsewhere in Mesoamerica, particularly Highland Mexico and the Maya region, there are relatively few studies of Classic Veracruz deities as a coherent system (or systems). In this symposium participants explore the challenge of recognizing and amassing a corpus of deities in the post-Olmec Gulf lowlands, ca 1-1000 CE, with special attention to attributes, cosmography, and materials analysis. To date, Classic Veracruz deities have largely been analyzed in relation to Postclassic Mexican correlates. More recently scholars have productively explored regional and temporal continuities between Classic Veracruz and the Gulf Coast Formative period and Classic Maya, respectively. The Epiclassic period offers a particularly fruitful set of iconographic relationships forged across Mesoamerica. Regional ethnographic analogy has also been applied. In a counter-movement to these comparative studies some iconographers question the merits of assuming synchronic and diachronic continuity. Working together with a rich array of theoretical and methodological approaches this symposium seeks to generate a more nuanced understanding of Classic Veracruz religion.",Symposium,Chair (Primary),Rex_Koontz,3.5,12,3.5,Th-evening

This paper considers place as an active agent in the mediation of modern Cypriot identity against a backdrop of centuries of colonial occupation. The focus is Arediou, south of the Green Line. Here, I explore how experiences of the past are embedded spatially but are also experienced differently according to their relationship to current narratives of being (Greek-)Cypriot and memories of occupation by the colonial other.
The slipperiness of Cypriot history, how certain spaces are remembered and memorialised while others are ignored or actively forgotten, demonstrates the intangibility of the past. Different narratives are attached to different phases of the Cypriot past: antiquity is concealed within a cloak of Hellenism, while the more recent Orthodox past is revered with great pride, and the turbulent recent past is proclaimed through the very name of the local kafeneio, the Parthenon.
Drawing upon local stories passed down over the generations, I explore how places within and around the village (local archaeological sites, copper mines, residues of British colonial activity, EOKA hideouts, abandoned villages) are variously remembered, forgotten, understood and represented, to actively create a sense of being Cypriot.

This is especially true following the Roman conquest of Iberia in the late 3rd century BCE, when the scale of mining increased dramatically to accommodate the growing needs of the Roman Empire. This was made possible through dramatic shifts in the organization of labor and the technological practices surrounding mining. Scholars often attribute these changes to Roman innovation, ignoring the long-term history of indigenous mining in many areas and the potential significance of local people in the successes of the industry. In this paper, I challenge this conventional interpretation and explore the diverse contributions of local people to the mining industry, from their knowledge of local resource distribution to their work as laborers in mining and subsidiary industries. I argue that Roman conquest transformed the everyday lives of local people, who in turn participated in the diverse communities of practice in Roman mining landscapes, contributing knowledge, skills, and resources that fueled this industry so key to the creation of the Roman Empire.

Most research has focused on the large Wari installations built in several regions of Peru, leading many scholars to conclude that Wari administrators established direct imperial control over these areas. More recently, scholars have started to adopt a complementary bottom-up approach to study changes experienced at the regional and household levels by smaller communities living outside the large Wari installations. This new perspective challenges previous interpretations of Wari as a strong, centralized, all-controlling colonial authority. In the Cusco region, survey and excavation data suggest that local populations were little affected by Wari presence. Continuity in settlement patterns and domestic and ritual activities reveal that locals did not adopt Wari practices. Like other early states worldwide, the Wari polity might have built enclaves that helped its settlers tap into the knowledge, authority, and networks of local elites. Obsidian, hallucinogenic snuff, and other exotic goods from Cusco further demonstrate that Wari colonists did not interrupt regional and long-distance exchange networks, but might have intensified prestige-goods competition and altered the balance of power among local societies.",Symposium,Presenter,V√©ronique_B√©lisle,3,11,3,Th-evening

To determine local patterns of responses to conquest, the Ifugao Archaeological Project (IAP) and the Bicol Archaeological (BAP) are working to produce localized archaeologies and histories to construct a Philippine-wide archaeology of colonialism. The IAP refutes dominant historical narratives surrounding the antiquity and nature of the highland Ifugao and their rice terraces. Rather than a people isolated from time and conquest, the IAP findings show that the Ifugao mobilized behind a concerted economic, political, and environmental restructuring as a pericolonial response to Spanish activities in the lowlands.

Were foreign practices resisted, adopted, or combined and hybridized with current practices? Did different social groups respond differently to the foreign group? This session takes a multi-component focus in examining both cultural (ex. architecture, ceramics) and biological data in order to understand the many facets in how societies respond to conquest.

The south coast of Peru was one of the regions conquered relatively early by the expanding Inca state. Following incorporation, a series of Inca administrative centers were established, all linked by a highway. Tambo Viejo was established in the Acar√≠ Valley. The south coast in general being incorporated peacefully, the control exercised by the Inca state likely was through local authorities. However, Inca control was brief and at most probably lasted no more than fifty years. As a result, the residents of valleys such as Acar√≠ experienced little change in their daily life. The architecture of Tambo Viejo and the associated ceramics do not exhibit much outside influence. Though material items display only minor changes, Inca ideology is apparent in the manner in which the center was planned. Tambo Viejo, although built with architecture in the local tradition, was conceived following the standardized Inca structural pattern that included a large rectangular plaza and an enormous mound that likely was an ushnu.

Previously, Menzel (1959) noted that lack of local monumental architecture associated to Inca sites in Nasca. In contrast to the Ica valley, surface data from sites in the Nasca area suggested that local populations lacked socio-political complexity and were organized at the level of the simple chiefdom. Later on Schreiber (1992) suggests integration of the territory was by means of adding an administrative tier to the local settlement pattern. In Nasca, there are no local settlements known to date that are spatially associated to Inca buildings. Schreiber suggests the Incas‚Äô interest on the Nasca was mainly due to its strategic location, in the junction of the highland with the coastal Inca trail. In this paper, I will built on data from excavations at Huayuri in the Santa Cruz valley, to add data on the nature of interactions between local households and the Inca state.

The Inka built Inkawasi in Lunahuana territory, envisioned as one of the copies of Cusco.  Inka presence in Guarco territory is documented at Cerro Azul, a primary Guarco center.  Its protected bay served as port for a society whose economy was based on maritime resources associated with documented fishing rituals as well as on irrigation agriculture.

Ethnohistorical accounts state the valley was occupied by the Kallawaya and Chuncho groups from the tropical piedmont (Saignes 1984, 1985; Steward 1948). Therefore, the Camata-Carijana Valley offers the opportunity to study Inka, Kallawaya, and Chuncho entanglements.

This paper focuses on the site of, Maukallajta, in the Camata-Carijana Valley.  Also known as Pueblo Viejo, Maukallajta was an Inka tambo. It was likely established to promote trade with other groups (Alconini 2012; Capriles Flores and Herrero 2006). More specifically, the research explores how the impact of Inka colonialism affected the architectural patterns of Maukallajta. Therefore, the location, organization, and architecture of Maukallajta will be analyzed to understand its nature and purpose (Moore 1992, 2011; Pozorski and Moore 1997). Terraces and roads associated with the site will also be examined.
 
Maukallajta is just one colonial space in the Camata-Carijana landscape in eastern Bolivia. Other settlements, pre-Hispanic roads, and agrarian terraces are discussed to provide a regional perspective and to explore the relative impact of Inka colonial processes in the Camata-Carijana Valley.

The study of the production and trade of metals is one of the means to highlight the technical and social organization of societies. Among several issues, the question of the provenance of the metal is of primary importance and can lead to enlighten the organization of the production (spatial and temporal structures of the chaine op√©ratoire) and of the supply networks. Concerning iron and its alloys, these last years have seen important developments in archaeological sciences to address the question of provenance. These approaches are based on both trace elements and isotopic approaches.
The aim of this paper is to discuss the principle, potentiality, advantages and limits of the archaeological science approach through the example of two provenance studies applied to different socio-economical contexts.. The first one deals with the circulation of iron products in the North-Alpine area during the end of the First Iron Age (6th-5th c. BC). The second one concerns the use of iron reinforcements in the gothic monuments and cathedrals of the Middle Age in France. Finally, several prospects will be proposed for developing integrated and interdisciplinary provenance studies in the future.

",Other,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis: Glass Analysis,Craft Production,"Scientific investigation of archaeological glass has advanced, beginning in the early 2000‚Äôs, with studies relying more heavily on determination of trace element concentrations to differentiate production recipes depending on distinct ingredient sources and the use of larger corpuses of artifacts to more easily and reliably reveal production patterns.  At the same time, isotope analyses (e.g., Pb, Sr and Nd) attempting to source raw materials used to manufacture glass in antiquity grew in importance, focusing mostly on glass produced around the Mediterranean basin.

In a new project, recently funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), we will combine trace element and isotope analyses to study the ancient glass industry of South Asia which, despite its importance and impact within and beyond the Indian Ocean region, is still poorly understood.  To this end, we will collect raw materials, test their suitability to obtain glass and compare the trace element and isotope signatures with those of different South Indian glass types.  By connecting Indian glass types to potential production regions in South Asia, the results of this project will illuminate the spatial and temporal interconnections between cultures and regions of the Indian Ocean and beyond.

This great potential was however not fully exploited in previous works. Here we present an on-going project of archaeometallurgical investigation of 7th-15th century silver-lead production sites in China. Environmental history study agreed that during this period, mineral coal replaced charcoal and became the main fuel of metal industry in China. Our investigation however reveals this is a rather complex and uneven process. In the more arid and densely populated north China coal-fired tubular crucibles were widely adopted in this period. In contrast, the south China smelters continued the more traditional furnace smelting process. More interestingly, crucible technology seems not to be embraced by iron and copper smelters until early modern period. Even in north China, large scale iron smelters still use charcoal rather than mineral coal. This work showcases the power of archaeological study of technology in enhancing our understanding of the complex history of human-environment interactions.",Symposium,Presenter,Siran_Liu,4,15,4,Th-evening

How can they appear, under the microscope, almost intact after all of this time? And, how can we be sure that residues are ancient, and not modern contaminants?

In addition to blind tests and anti-contamination protocols, important advances have been made in the development of new analytical techniques designed to improve the characterization of residues. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) provides high-resolution images with chemical compositional information.

In recent decades, however, archaeologists have increasingly recognised the marked regional differences inherent in Iron Age societies across different parts of Britain.

Different regions of Britain might have very different archaeological sequences in the Iron Age, yet there are some traits (including the uptake of continental La T√®ne art styles, the paucity of visible burial rites and the use of the roundhouse as the normative domestic form), that display a layer of cultural unity underlying this apparent variation.

However, the Burmese hare (Lepus peguensis) ‚Äì the sole member of the family Leporidae indigenous to mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) ‚Äì is rarely eaten today, and its status in the past is unclear. Although this taxon is currently abundant across a wide geographic range, it has a poor zooarchaeological record during the Pleistocene and Holocene. Identified specimens occur sporadically in hunter-gatherer contexts, and increase in presence and abundance during the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age. Ecological data suggests that L. peguensis prefers anthropogenically modified agricultural environments and can be an agricultural pest. This species may thus represent a potential commensal-prey species for prehistoric agricultural populations in MSEA. In this paper, we use zooarchaeological evidence for Burmese hare and stable isotope analysis of prehistoric and modern specimens to assess whether this taxon represents a commensal species in prehistoric mainland Southeast Asia.",Symposium,Presenter,Cyler N._Conrad,3.25,11,3.25,Th-evening

However, the utility of this approach for pinpointing the timing and geographic and cultural context of initial domestication has been recently questioned. This approach has been undermined by empirical findings from geometric morphometric studies of phenotypic variation in key diagnostic traits in dogs and pigs, DNA research, and theoretical thinking from the perspective of niche construction and the extended synthesis of evolution. These developments call for rethinking of current approaches to documenting early domestication pathways, and suggest a way forward to addressing pressing issues in the how and why human societies began to domesticate animals. A step in this direction is provided by recent work on the house mouse and the context of its initial commensal bond with pre-agricultural hunter-gatherers in the southern Levant.

Assemblages from the Argentinian pampas include small, medium and large points, produced either on a flake blank or by bifacial thinning on a biface, with or without fluting, with rounded or angular shoulders, that is, presenting variable sizes, design and manufacturing techniques. These variations were partly the result of the production of objects intended for different functions and partly of point life history. Regarding this life history, we here address a conservative strategy affecting Fishtail points in several localities in South America: recycling. Under the term recycling, we consider points modified by retouch to produce a different tool. Fifteen artifacts recovered at Cerro El Sombrero Cima, representing 16% of the point assemblage at the site, are considered recycled tools made on Fishtail points. They were identified through macroscopic observation of traits on edges and tips and the general artifact shape; possible uses of these recycled tools are studied through fatty acid analysis. Although points are transformed into different artifacts, such as side scrapers, knives, notches or drills, the characteristic Fishtail shape is recognizable, reinforcing the importance this design played in early societies.",Symposium,Presenter,Nora_Flegenheimer,3.25,12,3.25,Th-evening

Few sites have provided the opportunity to observe examples from the NFC discarded early in the production sequence, which can provide a glimpse of Northern manufacture protocols. This paper presents a hypothetical sequence of NFC point production developed using evidence from exhausted and discarded fluted point fragments, and a collection of rejected and damaged bifaces from four NFC sites. Discussion will address the integrity of the archaeological evidence for production stage by using multiple reduction indices, as well as an experiment re-creating NFC points using the manufacture sequence proposed.

The in-ground cemeteries are often encountered in urban development and during disaster reconstruction. Each of these scenarios present ethical conundrums when planning archaeological responses. For example, when do religious practices venture too far and become vandalism? When should urban development become more important than the history and protection of the dead? When a disaster requires months of effort, how are recovery efforts and cemetery preservation balanced? Working in Louisiana‚Äôs historic cemeteries presents a unique sphere where interaction with the dead and living communities is intertwined so deeply, they cannot be separated. This presentation addresses that situation, following the recent natural disasters so often encountered in Louisiana; and how ethical considerations and the affected communities succeed when both groups align with intended action.",Symposium,Presenter,Christine_Halling,1.75,6,1.75,Th-evening

From this comfortable position, archaeologists have failed to challenge the Western cultural basis for these ‚Äúissues‚Äù. Growing urbanization in the United States presents moral challenges as the exhumation of historic cemeteries becomes increasingly common. These challenges generate wide-ranging questions: Is this unavoidable? Who is ultimately responsible? Are some groups more deserving of analysis than others? What research is prioritized when money is scarce? Professional codes of ethics provide an insufficient framework for responding to these questions, resulting in inadvertent entrenchment that limits the scope of potential hypotheses and epistemic growth and overlooks the power of counter-narratives. The archaeology of historic cemeteries is uniquely placed for social engagement.

The project was initially designed to examine the ways Preclassic Maya leaders institutionalized political authority from the perspective of household archaeology, but has expanded to include excavation of civic architecture and remote sensing in open spaces. My research is informed by collective action theory, and the degree to which leaders engaged in exclusionary and inclusive practices over the site‚Äôs 2000 years of occupation. Findings have not supported my original exclusive power hypothesis in which early rulers circumvented kin-based authority by out-competing and fragmenting established households. Instead, the small number of founding elite and commoner houses enjoyed socio-economic prosperity during the Terminal Preclassic period when kingship was institutionalized. The rise to regional authority was rapid at Actuncan, which was built by burying an earlier settlement and greatly expanding civic structures. This expansion was achieved through inclusive practices that mobilized hinterland populations‚Äô labor and loyalties. Later, Classic-period elites experienced boom-and-bust cycles of growth and abandonment, which I argue is the result of elite competition for exclusive power.

The literature on ancient Maya urbanism focuses to a large extent on how urban spaces are arranged and what this says about social and political organization. However, the long occupations of many Maya centers resulted in urban centers that reflect a palimpsest of decision-making over centuries rather than a single grand plan. Indeed, evidence at many Maya sites suggests that urban plans were reworked as buildings were built, destroyed, renovated, repurposed, and abandoned based on present needs. So-called ‚Äúproblematical deposits‚Äù‚Äîdetritus left in and on abandoned spaces and buildings‚Äîprovide evidence that the later Maya acknowledged the differentially utilized nature of their urban centers. Yet, modifications to the urban landscape result from decisions made by someone: households, communities, leaders, or conquerors. As such, palimpsest urbanism is both a way of life and a product of political action.

At the site of Actuncan, Belize, we find that aspects of domestic ritual cycles, - including form, content, placement, and frequency, - show a flexible, even creative approach to ritual. In each foundation, renovation, and termination of a house, the inhabitants had the opportunity to carry out rites before groups of varying sizes, conveying a sense of community in some and distinction in others. These performances, and their material remains, were key components in the literal and figurative construction of the Actuncan community, as commoner and elite households actively reworked architectural forms and ritual templates to either perpetuate existing identities or signal new trajectories.

In the near term, tens of thousands of known archaeological sites and historic structures, and countless more currently unknown or undocumented, will be lost given modest (1-5m) changes in sea level.

Since the ‚Äúdry dam‚Äù first became operational during spring melt in 2007, extreme flood events occurred in 2009 and 2011 resulting in slope failures and erosion at three of the sites.

Corrective engineering actions focused on site slopes and their adjacent streambanks to reconstruct, stabilize, and revegetate the exposed and failing embankments.

As cultural sites are subjected to destructive processes, action is generally limited to mitigation and salvage of immediately threatened significant sites, while their destruction by the resettlement of affected communities has been given little attention. This secondary impact of climate change threatens sites outside of the immediate zone of flooding and erosion. Given the importance of cultural heritage sites to descendent communities, and their preservation of paleoclimatic and environmental records in association with the record of human settlements over millennia, it is imperative that we develop standard methods for assessing destruction risk of archaeological sites within a climate change framework. Using Casco Bay area in Maine as a pilot study, this study develops a methodology for integrating decadal-to-centennial climate change projections, socio-economic and demographic data, and state and federal land use and cultural resource management regulations to create a robust, user-friendly risk assessment framework.

The projects drew upon more than a century of prior field research, where four generations of archaeologists described and assessed organic preservation conditions at their sites in several regions of the Norse Eastern Settlement. This created a unique form of ‚Äúarchaeological TEK‚Äù (Traditional Ecological Knowledge) that represents an invaluable guide into the changing preservation conditions since late 19th century.

Between 2005-2017 we conducted extensive coring surveys of over 100 Norse middens, and open area and small test excavations at over 15 sites.  The results show a shocking and almost complete loss of once outstanding organic preservation in a region where only 60 years ago wood, bones, leather, wool, and feathers were recovered. Our findings draw attention to the destructive process of the modern climate change that has been affecting the organic preservation conditions for at least 60 years, and to the need to organize a circumpolar-wide, international response strategy to rescue the endangered sites and their unique cultural heritage before it is too late.

These locations are nexus points for community and polity making processes, embedding social hierarchies, ideologies, and social memories into the physical landscape. However, archaeologists have historically focused attention on monumental public spaces within large civic-ceremonial centers, and relatively little attention has been given to public spaces within rural communities. Yet it is at these public structures and spaces that entanglements of both top-down and bottom-up processes are visible to archaeologists. To explore the ways in which hinterland or ‚Äòrural‚Äô communities may integrate and articulate with larger ‚Äòheartland‚Äô seats of power, this paper will examine one such public group at the hinterland site of San Lorenzo, Belize. Data demonstrates that this group was used and modified by the local community from the Preclassic to the Terminal Classic periods.

",Maya: Classic,Survey,Settlement Patterns,"The Classic Maya, with their towering jungle temples and sprawling cities have been the focus of archaeological studies since the mid-1800s. Although numerous investigations have fostered considerable insights, important questions remain regarding the circumstances in which these settlements originated, interacted, developed, and were ultimately abandoned. The organization of Maya settlements is best conceptualized as a continuum consisting of three basic, but variable types, including: upper-level, middle-level, and lower-level settlements. This discussion reviews the primary research results for the full-coverage survey and test-excavation program conducted at the middle-level hinterland settlement of Waybil, Belize, Central America. The overall result was the collection of valuable information concerning the development of the central courtyard, peripheral settlement groups, and relic agricultural terraces found within the site. Middle-level settlements such as Waybil are unique units within the continuum as they are smaller and more specialized than upper-level settlements, but larger and more diverse than lower-level settlements. Thus, they are thought to have performed distinct roles and functions within the greater settlement matrix. Exploring the configuration of individual middle-level settlements is essential to improving our knowledge of ancient Maya socio-political and socio-economic interactions, hinterland archaeology, human-environment adaptive strategies, and the circumstances surrounding the Classic period ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù.

Although non-elites include some urban residents and all hinterland residents, this study proposes that some hinterland residents also identified as elites. The Medicinal Trail Community is a hinterland settlement with considerable variation in household complexity, ranging from simple perishable structures informally arranged, to households on elevated platforms formally arranged around a courtyard. The latter residents attempted to adopt the social identity of the urban elites by using the symbols and material culture of the ‚ÄúUrban Elites,‚Äù therefore becoming ‚ÄúHinterland Elites.‚Äù  As a result, these ‚ÄúHinterland Elites‚Äù economic and socio-political status was elevated above most of the community‚Äôs inhabitants, providing them with limited social power.

Using a community approach, this paper examines non-agrarian activities practiced during the late Early and Late Classic (ca. 500 ‚Äì 850 AD) by residents of Chunhuayum, a small yet socioeconomically diverse farming settlement located in northwest Yucatan. Through domestic assemblages and architecture, I argue that shell and chert craft production, and suprahousehold rituals, enabled three households to distinguish themselves more markedly from their neighbors while simultaneously partaking in the constitution of a local community. These activities, and their resulting relations of mutually constituting affiliation and distinction, are also related to nearby centers‚Äô faltering political clout and population decline. Reframing discussions of complexity to focus on the micro-levels of human interaction within a lower-order rural settlement, this research counters enduring assumptions about rural populations and contributes to a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of ancient Maya social complexity, in which hinterland people were diverse, active participants in local and regional historical processes.",Symposium,Presenter,C√©line_Lamb,4,15,4,Th-evening

Can we discuss and define rurality without reifying the false dichotomies of urban-rural and elite-commoner? How might we challenge traditional yet persistent conceptions of hinterland people?

Forty-one percent of the paintings in their territory occur in shallow caves and rockshelters, which vary in size. size restricts the number of paintings, as well as the number of people viewing them. Some rock shelters can accommodate a dozen people, while others only one to two. Many sites include cupules and/or bedrock mortars, which suggest women's participation. The surroundings also vary. Many of the rockshelters and shallow caves are hidden, while others could have been viewed by the village, which suggests that there are public and private sites.

Although each cave is different, those cavities in which we find evidence of ritual practice have certain elements such as water, complete darkness or ritual memory. These elements are important to the performance of ritual activities, because they call up sensorial feelings. It is unlikely that the entire audience participated in the whole ritual process.

Inside them, we enjoy the unique possibility of directly observing and analyzing spatial features that have hardly changed (and in some cases have not changed at all) since the Paleolithic. However, the poor preservation of the archaeological evidence during the earliest years of the research, and particularly the enormous cultural gap between the Paleolithic codes and systems of beliefs and the modern observers hinder the reconstruction of the events that may have taken place in those places.

In this paper, the available evidence on human action in caves with rock art of southern France and northern Spain will be described and analyzed. We will address relevant topics such as the spatial relationship between Paleolithic graphics and scenographic features of the caves (visibility of the paintings and engravings, capacity of the chambers, sound properties of the decorated areas‚Ä¶) and the evidence of human actions inside the karst (footprints, paths, archaeological items in passages and walls, artificial modifications of the cavern space‚Ä¶).

While many have argued for a theater-state among the ancient Maya, few have ventured beyond the large ceremonies conducted in great plazas to consider the more esoteric nature of public, semi-public, and private rites taking place in the natural landscape. Ancient Maya caves were used exclusively as ritual spaces, yet there has been little consideration of the performance characteristics of these sites. The ritual performances conducted in and around caves create a space for thinking about these venues as ""theaters"" with audiences, performers, backdrops, and lighting. In this paper we analyze architectural modifications to caves found in the Chiquibul Forest Reserve in Western Belize.

",Contact Period,Ethnohistory/History,Identity/Ethnicity,"Scholarly interest utilizing archaeological and ethnohistorical studies to understand the genesis and development of Caribbean creole societies has grown in the last few years. Perspectives have shifted to emphasize the diversity of groups in the Caribbean during precolonial times, and how this continued into the colonial period as Europeans and Africans coalesced in the area. The conflictual aspect of this interaction whereby Europeans imposed a system of forced labor, along with drastic Indian population losses have obscured the contributions of indigenous peoples to colonial societies and culture.
This paper summarizes archaeological and historical data for Puerto Rico and Hispaniola on the diversity of Indian groups in the early colonial period and the different ways they reacted and responded to Old World peoples. It postulates the concept of cultural transformation to explain the process of change occurring among these populations, and how they employed strategies which varied from island to island. It discusses the evidence for the persistence of Indian groups well into the colonial period and what this may imply for the formation of creole societies, and ends with a call for further archaeological research focusing on early colonial sites.",Symposium,Presenter,Karen_Anderson-Cordova,3.25,11,3.25,Th-evening

The term with its social, economic and cultural implications served to homogenize and differentiate populations, to eliminate identities of origin and to build a destiny of subordination and disappearance. In Cuba this category was transformed over the last five centuries and adjusted to various historical  circumstances. The historical and archaeological data of the Island indicate that the Indians did not maintain a passive attitude against the colonial power. They confronted or  learned to interact with him and sought mechanisms of survival. Although mestizaje and acriollamiento have been seen as processes of ethnic and cultural neutralization of the Indian, and as part of the causes of their disappearance, they were also channels for their integration into the colonial world and have a determining role in the current survival of their legacy.",Symposium,Presenter,Roberto_Valc√°rcel Rojas,3.25,11,3.25,Th-evening

This consideration has been founded on the study of the socio-economic dynamics and cultural transformation generated by the European colonial irruption, specially the creation of first Spanish colonial settlement on the island. At the same time, generate an excessive dependency of archaeological data of ethnohistorical sources, and formalized a reductionist interpretation and a historical division in the study of the creolization process. This point of view has ignored essential aspects of cultural diversity, socio-cultural interactions, and the transculturation among indigenous communities since pre-Columbian times.
This presentation addresses, from archeological data and historical criticism, cultural plurality and transculturation among indigenous communities that inhabited northern Hispaniola prior to the European colonial invasion.

The rise of European imperialism conducted to share the New World where the island of Espanola was officially occupied by the Spanish and French. Massive French investments into an agricultural industry lead to a large number of enslaved Africans being transported into the colony. Long before the division of the island into two possessions, Haiti experienced significant installations of French Buccaneers operating mainly along the North coast and Tortuga Island.  It is from these interactions that developed the first perceptions of the French encounter in the cultural landscape. Behind the traditional discourse, there were exclusive social categories for African, Mulatos, and White people of the colony, by using primary archives as sources, as well as historical and ethnographic perspectives, this presentation proposes to examine contributions of free and enslaved Indigenous people in the colony of Saint-Domingue and their legacies of their cultural survival in the Haitian present-day society.

Current archaeological investigations of the initial period of colonial settlement on Barbados focusing on Trents Plantation, and the pre-sugar era (1627-1640s) project an all-together different picture. The archaeological and historical record projects a multivalent, multicultural, mix of engagements between Indigenous, African, and European settlers. This complexity is expressed in the material record, particularly with the mix of locally produced and imported ceramics from the early 17th century plantation context at Trents.  The emerging colony on Barbados was English in name, but backed by the Dutch, and assisted by a group of Indigenous people who joined them from Guyana and Africans captured from a Portuguese ship.  Moreover, this colony was established in the 17th century Caribbean, a theater contested by the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and English, as well as a complex array of Indigenous peoples.  The result was the construction of a complex multi-vocal cultural ensemble of cultural and material expressions that is consistent with the dynamic cultural diversity that emerged in the region.

",Other,Other,Theory,"Studies on the emergence and development of the creole societies of the Caribbean have centered on the socio-cultural mix produced by the colonial processes without considering similar phenomena present in the region during Pre-Columbian times. The application of category of indio has blurred, denigrated, and homogenized these people and the plurality of ways in which they interacted, placed themselves, and were present in the creole universe of the Caribbean. The production of simplistic views of the creolization process is due to the focus on the inter-cultural engagements between Europeans and Indians or between Europeans and Africans. Moroever, such perspectives have obscured the plurality of the indigenous groups who resided in the Caribbean. In this session, we will also explore a range of theoretical and methodological perspectives used in the studies of the heritage and cultural continuity of the Indigenous presence in the Caribbean. Many earlier models are based on outdated reductionist notions that leave little room to study processes such as transculturation, hybridization and ethnogenesis.

",Other,Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology,Quantitative and Spatial Analysis,"Domestic dogs (Canis familaris) are a common presence in nomadic cultures, but archaeology still struggles to identify them in the absence of their faunal remains. What we lack is a means to identify behaviors that manifest themselves in the archaeological record that are in clear association with domestic dogs. One avenue is carnivore modified bone. What experimental studies indicate is that we can isolate patterns of feeding associated with particular carnivores, but what has not been demonstrated is whether we see differences between domestic and wild canids. We propose that one solution is to move beyond the marks on the bone and look at where they are found in campsites. Through our ongoing ethnoarchaeological study of the Dukha reindeer herders of north-central Mongolia, we use GPS tracking, photogrammetry, and mapping of canids and modified bone to isolate spatial patterning of domestic dog behavior.

We examine the relationship between total camp area and the number of bison hide tipis (reflected by surface stone rings) present at these archaeological sites.

We also compare our results to those observed in a global ethnographic dataset.

Over five field seasons, we have collected data on the spatial distribution of people and activities within the interior and exterior spaces of campsites of nomadic Dukha reindeer herders in Khˆvsgˆl Province, Mongolia.  In all, our sample includes more than 20,000 high precision spatial data points collected by observational mapping and photogrammetry.  In this paper, we examine how cultural models, division of labor, and other factors structure the distributions of male and female activities in Dukha camps.

How did the late precolonial collapse, social fragmentation, and violence of the broader Eastern Woodlands intersect with Chesapeake culture histories? This paper begins to assemble the evidence from which to explore this question. In the Ridge and Valley province, ceramic distributions point toward rapid population shifts while stoutly-fortified settlements began to appear with frequency by the fourteenth century. Piedmont and Coastal Plain communities also began to raise palisades at the same time that they adopted communal burial practices, ramped up maize production, and constructed ceremonial ditch enclosures at central places.

Second, we know from oral histories that Dhegiha Siouans departed the Ohio Valley at the same time as the Madisonville shift and have recently learned that the Anderson pattern is very similar to several Dhegiha accounts.  Hence, it is now possible to question whether the Anderson cultural system relates to Dhegiha Siouans moreso than the Madisonville one that may be more closely related to Central Algonquians.

This paper picks up these themes in a different region of the interconnected Bronze Age world that has been the focus of her research‚Äîancient Oman.

Known as Magan in Mesopotamian texts, a considerable amount of research has been conducted on Bronze Age Oman by focusing on its external connections to other polities. In this paper, I present an alternative, hyper-local perspective on the archaeology of this area. Utilizing ceramic and survey data collected in the spring of 2017 from the region surrounding the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Bat and nearby remains at ‚ÄòAmlah, this paper works to shift the focus of research on ancient Oman inwards by examining connections between settlements in the Bat region. An analysis of the ceramics collected in this area suggests a temporally dynamic landscape, with shifting centers of activity. Taking a localized, historically-particular approach to the archaeology of interactions in this small area ultimately reveals the significance of even the smallest known settlements in ancient Oman.

The technologies used to manufacture goods were themselves meaningful, often considered to be divinely inspired and certainly a key element in determining the value and significance of both everyday and esoteric objects.  As transformative processes, the methods and techniques of craft manufacture reflected the power of artisans to create and animate the material and social worlds.  Importantly, within media distinct technologies were often associated with different genders, classes, ethnicities, and other aspects of social identity.  Set within the context of the rise and fall of regional state-organized polities and waves of ‚Äúcontact‚Äù and conquest by more distant powers, I discuss how technological stability in some media reflected the persistence of autochthonic identities, ‚Äútraditional‚Äù social structures, and indigenous claims to place, while the episodic introduction of new technologies ‚Äì some developed locally and some ‚Äúimported‚Äù by more distant conquerors ‚Äì reflected the assertion of new loci of authority, the restructuring of sociopolitical relationships, and claims to different modes of prestige.",Symposium,Presenter,Cathy_Costin,3.25,12,3.25,Th-evening

Prof. Wright has established a suite of concepts and critiques that generate a comparative framework that is not restricted to a single geographical area. In her early work on ceramic production and craft, Wright synthesized the anthropology of technology with the archaeology of the Indo-Iranian borderlands, laying the foundation for a technological approach that transformed the archaeology of South Asia. Her critical re-evaluation of early cities, states, and complex societies incorporated past people and groups previously omitted from investigation, bringing to the forefront the political and economic dimensions of households and other social entities. Her work also drove the archaeology of identity and gender, correcting traditional approaches that too often left humanity out of explanations of the past. She has also established a landscape approach that examines the social relations that connected the city of Harappa to its many surrounding settlements, she has revealed rural/urban interactions that drove the emergence and transformation of urbanism. The impact of these contributions is ongoing, and has set the agenda for a new generation of comparative archaeology.

For example, the Old Assyrian mercantile indicate that pins could function as working capital in times of need. Furthermore, the survival of their impressions on crescent-shaped loom weights across Anatolia also demonstrate their importance to the economic agency of women.

These ‚Äúborderland‚Äù studies led to insights concerning exchange, production, and the roles of elite managers and non-elite ‚Äúlabor‚Äù. Archaeologists and economists examined the material culture of dozens of sites to assess changing borderland partnership networks. This evidence revealed innovations in management and production strategies. Those innovations led rapidly to spectacular wealth, yet growing inequality, in a new economic system, while more conservative central lowland Maya states to the north were declining.

As in Wright‚Äôs approach, this material culture history of these ‚Äúborderlands‚Äù provided a foundation for application of social and economic theory including Innovation Network theories and Network Failure theories from economics. This research is directed upward to examine the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù of changing state economic structure and ‚Äúdownward‚Äù to identify the agents and forms of agency involved. This work confirms Wright‚Äôs conviction that borderlands production and its agents and material products provide keys to understanding ancient economic systems and the people that acted within them.

This permanent exhibition is an introduction to the peoples of the US Southwest and was the first in the US to be curated by an expansive community. It was developed through the participation of more than thirty individuals and with seven core community curators. The community voices dominate the exhibit text and the community curators determined the exhibition message, object selection, and layout. HNA later served as the model for the initial exhibits at the National Museum of the American Indian.
Over the course of twenty years, however, HNA has not been updated, so that today it suffers from a static design, obsolete technology, and noncompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. MIAC has embarked on an ambitious plan to renew and update the exhibition while honoring the original curators and the inclusive process through which it was created. This paper addresses our plans to update the archaeology in the exhibition while respecting the intent of the original curators and the sensitivity of the topic.

What remains less addressed, however, is the long-term impact of digital recording. Because field projects often last several decades, there is a large gap between the initial methodological outlay and research design on one hand, and the final publication on the other. The true value of such digital resources becomes apparent only with the need of contextualizing and illustrating large volumes of artifacts, architectural or skeletal remains and other types of archaeological data, many years after the initiation of an archaeological project. The authors will use the example of the current Pylos excavations in Greece to emphasize the collection, storage, and dissemination of an avalanche of digital information with an emphasis on the integration of a complex database design, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), photogrammetry and aerial photography.",Symposium,Presenter,John_Wallrodt,3.5,12,3.5,Th-evening

Against this scenario, between 2013 and 2015 an Italian-American research project was undertaken at the Catacombs of St. Lucy at Siracusa. The research, including archaeological fieldwork, focuses on some very problematic parts of Region C. During the excavation, an array of 3D digital techniques was used for the daily recording of the archaeological units, but also to create high-resolution virtual replicas of certain districts of the catacombs and certain classes of materials, such as frescoes and marble architectural elements that could otherwise only be studied in the dark environment of the catacombs.

Using recent fieldwork at the Greek colonial site of Histria in Romania as a case-study, this paper explores the space between high-quality 3D documentation used only by an internal audience and decontextualized 3D content designed for public consumption. In particular, we seek to determine whether high-quality, measurable 3D models derived from photogrammetrical capture are useful in communicating excavation results to other scholars ‚Äì and if so, in what ways.

Burials and other pits at Stallings Island have layers of wood ash sandwiched between charcoal and shell; some rockshelters of the Cumberland Plateau contain successive layers of ash, each capped with earth; freshwater shell was mixed with ash to fill a massive pit on Silver Glen Run; and in north-central Florida, a dried sink filled with peat was burned to produce an ash layer containing scores of vessels. These and other cases span millennia and vast geography, and thus do not lend themselves to generalizations about the meaning or purpose of ash as a medium of ritual practice. However, in the broader cosmological framework of the Native Southeast, ash is a substance that was brought into existence through a transformation of matter that connected the Lower and Upper Worlds. In this sense, ash was indexical of cleansing or rebirth, much as the lifting smoke of a burning fire or the rising celestial bodies of the eastern horizon. As an ascendant, ash interacted with other agents to effect change or ensure desired outcomes while offering technical options for materializing expectation.‚Äã",Symposium,Presenter,Kenneth_Sassaman,3.25,12,3.25,Th-evening

In the U.S. Southwest, the patterned deposition of ash in archaeological contexts has been linked to practices of purification and the preservation or suppression of social memory. Turquoise also carries important symbolic meanings in the region, with notable links to moisture, sky, and personal and familial vitality. In archaeological contexts of the Pueblo Southwest, turquoise is often associated with ash or related features like hearths, suggesting an intentional link. This material linkage may represent a broader North American pattern as the association of ash/hearths and turquoise is apparent in multiple cultural contexts. We explore evident connections throughout North America before intensively examining co-occurrences at sites in the Homol‚Äôovi Settlement Cluster, a late prehispanic series of ancestral Hopi pueblos in northeastern Arizona.

Ash is commonly found below adobe caps in sealed floor hearths and termination pits of Jornada pueblo rooms as well as thin layers spread over abandoned and sealed floors.

Intentional ash deposits have occasionally been found in pithouse floor hearths, and there is evidence of ash layers associated with deposits of ritual paraphernalia in certain caves.

In particular, Hawikku‚Äôs mission remains and primary sources indicate its residence was a working and living space for Native laborers alongside Spanish Franciscans, comprising an everyday arena of cultural negotiation. Revisiting overlooked collections also furnishes occasion for collaboration with source communities, often excluded from the original research. Multi-level engagement with Zuni Pueblo informs this research project, increasing its relevance to community concerns, and enriching Smithsonian collections data for future use.  When financier Harmon Hendricks wrote in 1918 that the Museum of the American Indian should build expanding rubber walls to contain the large collections from Hawikku, he exposed the expedition‚Äôs acquisitive motive but also presaged their rich and ongoing potential for research a century later.",Symposium,Presenter,Klinton_Burgio-Ericson,4,16,4,Th-evening

Almost all extant polychromed wooden¬†qeros¬†attributed to the colonial period derive from museum and private collections and lack provenience and precise means of dating. Here, we investigate the chronology and production of qeros¬†by characterizing lead white pigment (lead hydroxycarbonate or lead carbonate, introduced to the Andes by the Spanish) used in the decoration of these vessels. We analyzed the Pb isotopic composition of lead white pigments taken from 21 colonial period¬†qeros¬†that currently reside in the collections of the National Museum of the American Indian-Smithsonian Insitution, the American Museum of Natural History, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and in private collections. The results indicate that, during the early colonial period Andean artists initially used lead white pigment manufactured from Spanish ores. In contrast, later period¬†qeros¬†were decorated with lead white pigment that was likely synthesized from local ore sources. Based on these results, we suggest the isotopic composition of lead white pigment may function as a chronological marker for colonial period¬†qeros.

By retroactively implementing an accession lot system and creating virtual accession files of digitized documents, we have reunited documentation stored in NMAI archives with associated objects. The project reverses the typical methodology of starting with an object and searching for its related documentation; instead, we have systematically reviewed archival documents, matched them with objects, and connected sometimes far-flung and previously lost bits of information. As a result, we have uncovered detailed and complex connections between our objects and hundreds of collectors and archaeologists not previously visible in our museum catalog, all of which is readily available to researchers.

While the original contexts of many museum objects have been lost, the collection of Panamanian gold and resin in the National Museum of the American Indian was re-evaluated for its potential to answer key questions about the ancient craftspeople of this region. To ensure accurate provenience information was associated with each artifact, research was undertaken in the archives of the NMAI. The resulting letters and field notebooks provided insight into the fascinating history of these objects. Scientific analysis further contextualized these objects in terms of the materials and fabrication techniques. Compositional analysis of 231 gold objects using XRF revealed significant patterns related to the source of the raw materials and the technological choices that went into making them. Three resin objects also underwent FTIR and GC-MS analysis to identify the plant source of the resin.

Such networks in the Western Desert involve trophic interactions between people and many other species, and are sustained in patterns of consumption and renewal, especially anthropogenic disturbance via landscape burning for the purposes of hunting and sharing small game. Martu homelands are constructed in the weave of these interactions, and are represented in patterns that have clear archaeological signatures. Here we illustrate ways that Martu hold and represent their ecosystems and archaeological landscapes, especially in values of disturbance and consumption. We attempt to show how some notions of ‚Äúconservation‚Äù (defined in terms of archaeological heritage or otherwise) can work at cross-purposes with values of disturbance maintained by many remote-living Martu.

For over a decade communities have struggled to marshal these assemblages of cultural heritage to demonstrate their traditional ownership to acquire resource royalties. An imperfect and highly political process, claimants must overcome the legacies of out-migration, Christianity, and iconoclasm which have unevenly configured the distribution and knowledge of the past. In the midst of these processes, aspects of this diffuse heritage emerge unexpectedly: a WWII airplane rising up from the delta, stone tools unearthed by bulldozers, or rumours of ancestral beings encountered in the forest.

Tribes, however, encounter several capacity-related challenges in developing tribally-specific heritage management plans. These challenges include the lack of funding for tribal historic preservation and repatriation, shortage of qualified staff, and, most significantly, operating within a heritage framework that was not designed with the needs or interests of tribes in mind. Given these significant challenges, how can an indigenous nation make archaeology work for and in accordance with tribal needs and values? Using the case study of Field Methods in Indigenous Archaeology, this paper evaluates how community-based research with the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Community of Oregon contributes to a uniquely Grand Ronde way for doing archaeology.

Indigenous archaeology has been couched as a knowledge-producing partnership between Western scientific methods (e.g. subsurface excavation, radiocarbon dating, artefact analysis) and indigenous ways of knowing the past. This session aims instead to foreground indigenous people as archaeological practitioners, examining how people interpret their past through engagement with archaeological and geomorphological features such as ancient landscapes, ecological patterns, surface finds, and subsurface sediments.

The application of archaeological sciences to analyze materials at the compositional level generates data suitable for the description and interpretation of the historical processes of human mobility and social interaction which in turn presents how materials and their physical qualities have functioned as participants and mediators of history and not only as a background to history.

The purpose of this study has been to expand the documentation and analysis of surfacing techniques. Alongside extensive attributional analysis, expedient quantitative analysis of various surface-topographies can enrich operational sequence studies and illuminate the creative environment in the past. The time spent burnishing a ceramic is a compressed time of repetitive and monotonous actions, when gestures blur into the next as easily as the former, and the non-linearity of productive labor can be seen and heard. Burnished ceramics, like quilts in a knitting circle, were audience to the kinds of social interactions which reinforce ties, circulate gossip, and hash out political grievance and agreement.

In doing so, different methods including archaeometric techniques, quantification, artifact classification, and species determination are combined to elaborate natural origin, making, distribution, and utilization of the objects. The Paracas remains were excavated by the Palpa Archaeological Project and mainly derive from three representative sites situated at distinct altitudes on the western Andean slope: Jauranga (285 masl), Collanco (1,630 masl), and Cutamalla (3,300 masl). Accordingly, the Late Paracas period (370-200 BC) in the Palpa valleys (Andean Transect) serves as a case study for this archaeoeconomic approach.
The results show exchange processes in the western Andes that are characterized by unbalanced commodity flows. Resources from the highlands such as obsidian, camelids and their products ‚Äì for instance wool ‚Äì arrived at the Pacific desert strip in large amounts, while marine resources such as sea shells reached highland regions only in small amounts. Raw materials were not just procured in the mountains, there were also strategic production centers like Cutamalla.

Incorporating both visual analyses of and compositional derived from LA-ICP-MS analyses of Tumilaca and Estuqui√±a pottery, I complement the long recognized stylistic distinctions by examining the transformation of productive practices and the organization of ceramic production as Moquegua underwent processes of population replacement and cultural change. Drawing in particular on material from Tumilaca la Chimba, a site with an Estuqui√±a occupation partially superimposing a Tumilaca occupation, I propose that the ceramic data suggest a more nuanced and complex picture of the transition from the terminal Middle Horizon to the LIP which, in tandem with new radiocarbon dates and excavation data, challenges the assumed temporal break between terminal Middle Horizon and LIP occupations in Moquegua and instead raises the possibility of a period of social interaction between communities.",Symposium,Presenter,Nicola_Sharratt,4,16,4,Th-evening

Investigation of the Songoy-Cojal site in the mid-Za√±a Valley shows that Gallinazo-Mochica coexistence persisted at least until the 8th century CE (based on new C-14 dates). Many problematic assumptions concerning the role of the Gallinazo (e.g., culture, political or non-cultural entity), however, have emerged in recent decades, resulting from the widespread adoption of conventional stylistic and art historical interpretations.  In this paper, I operationalize a new practice-based approach which combines concepts of technological style and technological choice, to explore more meaningful dimensions of these artifacts. Combining techno-stylistic, metric and archaeometric (pXRF and NAA) data, and social network analysis (or SNA) techniques, this work takes several steps toward resolving debates over the nature of Gallinazo-Mochica coexistence.

While artifact variability in the region has largely been organized in hypothetical phases, expanded data on garment design and production details, as well as imagery, is most usefully organized and correlated using a formal typology. While social diversity may account for a larger percentage of formal variation than has been considered under the phase model, hypothetical temporal sequences among garment styles imply processes of adoption and syncretism.  While to date we cannot document the geographic loci of garment production, correlations between characteristics of plant and animal fibers, natural and dyed colors and particular style groups suggest a vertical organization of production and exchange that ranged from agricultural selection and herd management practices to the contribution of a finished textile to a particular mortuary rite. Artifact forms and component materials support a model of sociopolitical relationships linking diverse communities of practice, whose presence, prominence and self-definitions change over time.

However, research on bead production among the Mante√±o-Guancavilca (AD 800-1532) of coastal Ecuador highlights the fundamental importance of this category of artifacts. By recording six measurements and four qualitative observations for each of 7651 beads from six sites (two regions, three stretches of time), this research has been able to recognize two distinct ch√¢ines op√©ratoires. At approximately AD 1200, bead makers shifted from a highly regular production sequence resulting in standardized chaquira (tiny beads) made from the ritually and economically significant shellfish, Spondylus, to one that is more opportunistic and results in irregular beads rarely made from Spondylus. This ‚Äúdestandardization‚Äù is associated with external economic forces, but also highlights the significance of the bead maker community of practice. Bead making endured the near complete loss of a market for chaquira, by becoming more flexible in their production strategy. That is, they tweaked their technological style to fit a new situation. In this way, bead makers retained their identity, as is demonstrated in the inclusion of raw material, production debris and tools in burials. This paper proposes some ways to think about change and durability in a community of practice.",Symposium,Presenter,Benjamin_Carter,4,16,4,Th-evening

The Classic Pukara style is associated with monumental public constructions and sunken temples, elaborate stone sculpture, and a unique polychrome pottery tradition. Spotted felines, disembodied heads, camelids and plants, and anthropomorphic figures were incised and painted on incense burners, trumpets, and other special purpose ceramic vessels that were circulated in the Titicaca Basin and to neighboring regions. While there is limited direct evidence of ceramic production at Pukara, previous researchers have inferred centralized fineware production based on standardization measures such as size, shape, paste, and surface finish recorded from various collections. To further explore the nature of crafting practices during the Late Formative at Pukara, compositional analysis using LA-ICP-MS was recently completed of 150 samples, including clays collected near Pucar√° town and archaeological ceramics excavated from Pukara. We present the results of these analyses, which are used to address functional, chronological, and spatial variability in the production, circulation and consumption of Pukara utilitarian and ritual vessels during the Late Formative period.

The initial industry (LCA type) is characterized by a stylistic homogeneity coupled with a wide geographical distribution. Compositional analyses, however, have shown a significant regularity in pastes, suggesting the use of localized sources of raw materials and/or specific production centers‚Äîindicative of a well-defined recipe and style. Provenance studies have identified a locus of production in the Guatacondo valley, in the hyper-arid core of the Atacama. In this valley the production and consumption of LCA pottery coincides with the emergence of mud architecture. Both technologies were developed in a geomorphological environment characterized by multiple outcrops of clay, making this material easily accessible. 
Using archaeometric methods, we approach both traditions as technological practices that required specific technical gestures, bodily engagements, labor organization, and temporal rhythms, mobilizing a collective that was partially constituted as such through the repeated and enduring transformation of mud. Considering the networks of materials, practices, and spheres of circulation wrought by these technologies, we offer an interpretation of the Formative process that centers on the qualities of clay in order to understand the material trajectories of this social landscape.

The smashing of ceramic vessels as an element of ritual practice is recorded ethnographically among some twentieth-century Maya groups. Other Maya groups have been documented collecting sherds from domestic middens and depositing them at sacred sites. If caves were venues for the former type of behavior in antiquity, one would expect to find a high percentage of refitting sherds in their assemblages. A lack of consensus exists among scholars as to the prevalence of refitting sherds because these data are rarely provided in reports. The lack of refitting is most acute with unslipped ceramics because, while analysts might spend considerable time attempting to reconstruct a polychrome vessel, few would spend time working with unslipped material.

Part of the attraction of this idea was no doubt its close paralleling of the popular Western dichotomy, sacred vs. profane. The problem with truisms, statements so obviously true that they say nothing new or interesting, is that they direct attention elsewhere. This is probably why the Temple of Xtoloc was never placed on the Carnegie map of Chichen Itza even though Ann Axtell Morris excavated there in the 1920s. When a truism is not true the impact can be disastrous for our understanding of the subject.

The significance of the features becomes apparent when the context, mainly construction and artifact deposition, is considered. Many of these subterranean features have been created naturally through geologic processes. However, it is significant that in areas devoid of natural subterranean features, pre-historic Native Americans constructed subterranean features to substitute for their natural counter parts. The archaeological and ethnographic literature document that ritual subterranean features are distributed throughout North America. Evidence includes ritually deposited cordage and sandals in the south and western portion of the United States, origin myths associated with Wind Cave in the Black Hills of South Dakota, and in New England where artificial subterranean features were created.

The occurrence of ‚Äúforeign‚Äù materials at surface and cave sites have become an increasingly well-documented phenomenon (Brady et al. 1997) and are indicative of transport of speleothems during ancient Maya cave visitations. This phenomenon has raise several questions such as the spatial and temporal extend of these interactions, practices, and specifically the relationship between Maya polities and proximal or distant caves. 

Geochemical analysis of samples by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analyses (INAA) is a very common and reliable practice. In this study we analyzed (71) samples comprised of various types of speleothems (Stalactites, stalagmites, flowstones, cave pearls) collected in various locales in Belize (Macal, Barton Creek, Pine Ridge, Roaring Creek, Cave‚Äôs Branch and Sibun Valley). Our samples were come from two separate expeditions, the Belize Valley Speleothem Project and provided by Dr. Holley Moyes (U.C. Merced), and Xibun Archaeological Research Project provided by Dr. Polly A Peterson.  Our results elucidates the use of INAA as a viable method of sourcing lithic materials, differentiating samples within the same cave and between different caves.

The geological processes that shaped these landforms and produced outcropping lithic material also created ideal conditions for the growth plant food resources, particularly root crops. These root crops thrive on the lithosols containing outcropping toolstone and were extensively harvested by Plateau groups in the past.

With the geoarchaeological survey into the turquoise and cinnabar mines in the Qinling Mountain Range, this paper understands the political landscape of the first Bronze-Age state, Erlitou, through analysis of geography, resource flow, transportation, and archaeological sites in the Qinling Mountain Range. Moreover, by integrating the materials from 3rd to 2nd Millennium BC in a broader geographical scale, this paper dynamically understands the process from the prosperity of the fringe areas of the Loess Highland to the Luoyang-centric network. This transformation is not only reconfiguration of the political landscape, but also the preparation of knowledge prerequisite for the political landscape of the Chinese Bronze Age.",Symposium,Presenter,Tao_Shi,4,15,4,Th-evening

A mining area for tabular chert, approximately 10 hectares in size, was established at this locale in the course of a series of archaeological excavations, core soundings and a geophysical prospection. At Rein, tabular chert occurs in residual loams and mined in up to four meter deep shafts. According to this evidence, the site is only the second archaeologically traced Neolithic chert mine in present-day Austria.
The extracted raw chert plates suitable for chipped stone tool production were either worked on-site or shaped into bars, and subsequently transported into the settlements for further processing. Radiocarbon dates from charcoal samples derived from the prehistoric backfilling of the shafts indicate the Rein chert mine was in operation between 4500 and 3800 BC. 
Additionally, the raw material was petrographically and geochemically characterized, allowing for accurate provenance studies of artifacts from prehistoric sites produced from Rein chert.

Ochre is used worldwide for symbolic and functional purposes, and is often considered to be evidence for symbolic behavior by cognitively modern Paleolithic humans. Geochemical provenience analysis, complemented by ethnographic studies of ochre source exploitation, transport, and use, can elucidate whether culturally mediated source exploitation differs significantly from a least-cost energetics (closest source) model of source use. In 2015‚Äì2017 we sampled 53 ochre deposits in the Kenya Rift Valley, guided by Maasai, Samburu, and Dorobo informants. The strontium isotope ratio (87/86 Sr) and elemental composition of these sources were characterized using Electron Probe MicroAnalysis and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. Our results show that the Provenience Postulate is upheld at the regional scale by 87/86 Sr ratios and at the local scale by elemental composition, facilitating sourcing of cultural ochre.  Analysis of ochre recovered from the Elmenteitan Neolithic cremation burial site of Njoro River Cave shows that the pigment is derived from two sources 110 and 150 km to the south, despite the availability of high quality ochre at deposits 20-35 km away and nearby the main sources of obsidian artifacts found at this site.",Symposium,Presenter,Andrew_Zipkin,4,15,4,Th-evening

Subterranean storage features were used during the late Late Woodland period (AD 1200-1600) in parts of the Michigan Inland Waterway. Such cache features prolong the availability of food stuffs and mitigate against the risk of food shortage. This paper discusses the research methodology required for identifying such features. While many are identifiable by their symmetrical circular depression, and apparent spatial clustering, an insufficient number have been ground truthed. Recent fieldwork revealed that identifying subsurface features may be more elusive than believed. Excavation of suspected cache pits resulted in negative results, leading to a re-evaluation of the sampling criteria and methodology, and resulting in a multi-disciplinary approach employing the soil sciences to create a more efficient ground truthing strategy.

However, there is also an experiential element to archaeological survey in which practitioners consciously and unconsciously observe patterns in the field that lead them to hunches or gut feelings that drift beyond quantifiable, empirical observation.  While such hunches are occasionally crafted into hypotheses, they are more commonly shared and discussed among practitioners without finding their way into the official project record.  The experiential knowledge obtained through archaeological survey is the result of accumulated observations of archaeological and geographic phenomena as well as interactions with the environment.

There is much diversity in tool use: hide working, butchery (meat/fish), impact, antler/bone working, wood working, and plant working. Various patterns were detected between tool use and tool technology. Many of the numerous microliths, showed impact damage, but are attributed to fishing rather than hunting. This conforms to the riverside location of the site on the River Eden. Hide working was primarily limited to dry hide, which supports the hypothesis that hunting was not the primary procurement activity and is also suggestive of a residential site, which is further supported by the diverse set of tools and wide range of activities represented.

Blades, blade-like flakes, and two blade core fragments are among the lithics recovered from these contexts. Because these transitional-looking assemblages were recovered from early Holocene contexts, we believe they potentially represent groups of early Archaic peoples who were separated from other groups that also practiced blade technology, possibly before they reached the UCP. The transitional nature of the assemblages suggests that blade technology gradually went away as people became increasingly familiar with the local environment, and therefore raw material sources. We further believe that these were family foraging groups that were seasonally occupying these shelters. Thus far, lithic technological analyses reveal that older or more experienced members of the groups were teaching less experienced people stone tool production.

Formalized bifacial projectile points are certainly the residues of systems of social interaction, and therefore have the potential to tell us something about social networks. The idea that relationships between artifact variability and social networks are simple, however, can be challenged on both theoretical and empirical grounds: complex systems science and ethnographic data strongly suggest that patterns of person-level interaction do not directly correspond to patterns of material culture visible at archaeological scales. A model-based approach can be used to better understand how changes in human-level behaviors ‚Äúmap up‚Äù to changes in both the system-level characteristics of social networks and the patterns of artifact variable that we can describe using archaeological data.

Previous excavations identified three bone deposits. Bone Bed 1, the oldest deposit, yielded a single uncalibrated radiocarbon date of 12,460 +/- 490 BP. Investigators in the 1960s and 1980s argued that the patterned distribution of megafaunal elements associated with large limestone cobbles in Bone Bed 1 suggests human subsistence activity. However, no formal artifacts were recovered. Mounting evidence for earlier than Clovis occupations elsewhere in Texas, combined with advances in dating technology and spatial analysis, catalyzed new research into Bonfire Shelter‚Äôs deepest deposits. In the summer of 2017, Texas State University archaeologists excavated a 3x1m2 trench into intact Bone Bed 1 deposits. A three-tiered approach was implemented to identify evidence of human activity: targeted sampling for microdebitage in association with Pleistocene megafauna, a Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry based spatial analysis of faunal remains, and a column sample addressing the depositional environment of the shelter over 12,000 radiocarbon years ago.

Natural process emphasize dynamic environmental conditions, coupled with resource availability, primarily including changes in riverine drainage dictating Paleoindian site location. The cultural processes involved in site formation have often been juxtaposed as aggregations of small bands of highly mobile hunter-gatherers vs. re-occupation by single bands of hunter-gatherers. Evaluation of the data derived from the Late Pleistocene Carson-Conn-Short site (40Bn190) in the Lower Tennessee River Valley suggests other factors beyond the traditional aggregation/re-occupation models are important in site formation. The data presented here also raises important implications for modeling the development of sedentism and horticulture in the Midsouth.",Symposium,Presenter,J. Scott_Jones,3.5,13,3.5,Th-evening

This view is certainly shaped by many well-known single component bison kills which form the basis for the argument. The Lindenmeier (5LR13) Folsom site of northern Colorado might be a notable exception to the high mobility model, as it contains hundreds of Folsom tools, animal bone, chipping debris, and decorated artifacts spread over 800 meters of buried deposits. Approximately 9 to 12 dense artifact concentrations are documented across the site, and questions remain as to what these clusters represent ‚Äì discrete living floors, middens, or palimpsests? Resolving the nature of these deposits is key to integrating Lindenmeier into broader land use models. This presentation summarizes the poorly known locales in the eastern portion of the site. The first discoveries were made here in the 1920s, and the Smithsonian excavated a bison bone bed nearby shortly thereafter.

The excavation of 30m2 revealed several superimposed features, including hearths, small refuse pits, and a bell-shaped pit. Debitage of different varieties of chert is ubiquituous, as is heat-spalled rock of different lithologies. Several observations suggest that the site was repeatedly occupied by large groups of people performing multiple activities. In the course of its existence, the function of the excavated area of the site seems to have changed from primarily residential to one that involved the periodic burning of the floodplain vegetation and churning of the soil, most likely in preparation for the planting of crops.

Obsidian is one of the few materials that can provide evidence for long-distance exchange through geochemical analysis, although relatively few sourcing studies have been carried out on Preceramic obsidian. In this paper, we report recent pXRF results from obsidian recovered at two Preceramic sites: Las Estacas, an Early Archaic period site in the Yautepec Valley of Morelos, and Yuzanu 36, a Late Archaic site from the Nochixtl√°n Valley, Oaxaca. Our results show that in each case a single obsidian source predominates, with at least 94% of the Las Estacas sample (n=100) from Otumba and 100% of the Yuzanu 36 sample (n=31) sourced to Guadalupe Victoria. We compare the results from Las Estacas and Yuzanu 36 to Preceramic and Early Formative period obsidian sourcing data from elsewhere in Mesoamerica. Data for the Preceramic and initial Early Formative indicate that in most cases obsidian procurement was focused on a small number of sources with procurement diversifying by the later Early Formative. We discuss the implications of the evidence for means and patterns of obsidian exchange.

A broken preform and characteristics of the flaking debris provide indications of reduction strategies. Two informal flake tools and a pair of non-diagnostic bifaces reflect generalized activities.

In 2009 the site was subjected to intensive geoarchaeological investigation with the goals of identifying the relationship between the faunal and archaeological remains through developing an understanding of their context. Three allostratigraphic units were identified: The oldest unit, which contains the bone bed, consists of colluvially reworked tephra bracketed by radiocarbon dates of 15,700 and 12,920 years BP (Cal. 2-sigma). The middle unit, marked by a prominent Btkb horizon, minimally dates to 10,190 years BP and likely contains the archaeological materials. The youngest unit truncates the underlying middle unit and represents relatively recent or Late Holocene erosion and deposition.

Rapid advances in technology have lowered barriers to biomolecular information by increasing the speed, affordability, and effectiveness with which researchers can extract and analyze biomolecules from ancient materials. Amid growing attention on museum collections as a source of samples for biomolecular research, the people who curate and manage these collections are faced with new challenges and considerations. Although destructive sampling is often necessary for the best available techniques, critical questions remain about how to balance the gain of scientific knowledge against the loss of materials for future study. 

This paper addresses major issues in biomolecular research and destructive sampling within the context of the physical anthropology collections at the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) of the Smithsonian Institution. External and internal processes for destructive sampling requests are reviewed, and appropriate conditions and expectations for approved proposals are discussed. Ultimately this paper aims to facilitate ethical and excellent biomolecular research on archaeological remains at NMNH, which has a responsibility to preserve and provide access to its collections in the service of science and for the public, as well as an institutional mandate to increase and diffuse knowledge.",Symposium,Presenter,Sabrina_Sholts,2.25,8,2.25,Th-evening

These range from blood samples, to hair bundles, single bones, complete skeletons, mummies, and decorated skulls, and are widely used for scientific research. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, anthropological and biological research gave us a greater understanding of human diversity, much of it based on anatomical evidence. Cambridge was at the forefront of this endeavour, and the result was the Duckworth Collection and Laboratory.
Following best practice guidelines in the document Guidance for the Care of Human Remains in Museums by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in October 2005, the Duckworth Laboratory created its own Policy for the Curation and Conservation of Human Remains. However, the past few years has seen a surge in biomolecular analysis of archaeological remains including human bone, teeth, tissue, hair, and dental plaque; innovative projects that require destructive analysis. A new position of Collections Manager for the Duckworth was created to facilitate this research whilst maintaining the integrity of the Collections. This presentation highlights the recent challenges in balancing both academic demand for sampling and the curation of human remains in the UK.

Despite recent advances in the recovery and authentication of aDNA, environmental contamination and inconsistent molecular preservation remains a continuous concern. Recent studies suggest that dental calculus may provide a better preservation environment for DNA than other archaeological materials, yet this hypothesis has not been systematically tested. In this study, we adopt a non-targeted shotgun approach to analyze the preservation of microbial and human DNA in 48 paired dental calculus and dentin samples from archaeological contexts. These represent a broad spatial and temporal breadth and thus contribute to a better understanding of DNA preservation in dental calculus independent of burial context, age of the sample, and depositional environment. Our investigation demonstrates that dental calculus offers a robust preservation environment for endogenous microbial DNA. In addition to the strong microbial signal, calculus consistently contained low amounts of human DNA, and thus may serve as an appropriate source of DNA for analyses of archaeological materials stemming from environments less conducive to molecular preservation.",Symposium,Presenter,Allison_Mann,2.25,8,2.25,Th-evening

",Historic,Ancient DNA,Cultural Heritage and Preservation,"Bengal cotton muslin, a particularly fine type of woven cotton fabric, had legendary status where it was traditionally produced in East Bengal‚Äînow Bangladesh‚Äîfor at least 2000 years. During the colonial influence of the British Empire, muslin was widely traded outside of South Asia, and became a valuable global commodity with major impacts on both local producers and foreign markets. Political turmoil and market forces, especially pressure from the East Indian Company, completely halted muslin manufacture in the early 20th century. As a result, ‚ÄúPhuti Karpas‚Äù‚Äîthe variety of cotton required for its production owing to particular fiber characteristics, botanically Gossypium arboreum var. neglecta‚Äîwas entirely lost. An extensive search was undertaken to locate any living example of neglecta in crop fields or in the wild, and a candidate wild population was identified. With only 100-250 year old herbarium specimens available for comparative materials, we use whole genome sequencing of modern and herbarium specimens to suggest that a wild-type Phuti Karpas has indeed been rediscovered.

",Other,Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology,Iconography and Art: Rock Art,"Over the last decade, a major challenge for archaeologists has focused on understanding the relationship between people, things and the sea. As part of this effort archaeologists have increasingly focused their attention towards rock art as a symbolic means to referencing a maritime identity. At one level, identifying this connection can be relatively straightforward via marine-themed imagery (e.g. watercraft, marine animals) but what else can we draw upon to understand the nature and depth of this relationship? In this paper, we turn to the ethnographic record as a lens to explore how specific motifs and sites from two locations in northern Australia (western Arnhem Land‚Äôs Wellington Range, and the Sir Edward Pellew Islands in the southwest Gulf of Carpentaria) are embedded in complex social and cultural networks for Australia‚Äôs ‚Äòsaltwater people‚Äô. At the core of our argument is the need to recognize how aspects of the ethnographic record such as song, kinship, cosmology and memory can play a pivotal role in accessing the meaning and symbolism of ‚Äòsaltwater‚Äô rock art as well as how these images encode or communicate information about people‚Äôs social identities.

",Other,Digital Archaeology,Mobility,"In early stages of archaeologists working with island biographies water was viewed as a dividing force, creating a barrier between communities. Lately, many have agreed that this is too simplistic a view and now see water as a binding force that allows for communities to connect across channels separating continents from islands or islands from their neighbors. In fact, the sea itself is a container for interactions between seafarers, who likely ate, slept, and communicated details of their journey to one another. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to trace the exact routes used by past navigators. Using least cost pathway analysis, I applied an isochrone method to analyze water-based travel corridors as canoe routes through the Caribbean to suggest possible route trajectories between sites connected through the movement of materials. Alongside evidence from experimental canoe voyages that speak to the physical relationship between voyager and voyage, these routes can place seafaring on the map. It is possible to draw attention to the relationship between canoer, travel corridor, and inter-island relationships by highlighting water as a connecting force within the lives of Amerindian canoers before 1492.",Symposium,Presenter,Emma_Slayton,2.75,9,2.75,Th-evening

While many aspects of the archaeological record can be interpreted as referencing the watery realm through association (e.g. shell middens) or visual cues (e.g. rock art), our goal with this session is not to focus on simply identifying these connections, but to interrogate the nature of these relationships ‚Äì to consider how water acts as a relational presence, and one that is informed by epistemologies and ontologies. Writing in the context of maritime people in Australia, McNiven (2008, 149) identifies a ‚Äòrelational nexus between people, spirits, and the sea‚Äô ‚Äì a useful observation that orients our thinking about the various elements that can be used to explore the water/people relationship. We wish to address the complex relational aspects between people, things, and water as a way of better understanding the social/cultural networks in which they are embedded, and the myriad ways people construct, maintain and express their identity. This session includes papers that draw not on archaeological, ethnographic and historical resources to address the relational through the lens of the watery realm.",Symposium,Chair (Primary),Courtney_Nimura,2.75,9,2.75,Th-evening
