the university of wyoming archaeological repository (uwar) is the largest archaeological collection and the only federally-regulated repository in wyoming, providing an unprecedented centralized location for researchers and the public to discover and engage with the 16,000 years of human occupation in this part of north america. however, the current collections management system at uwar does not facilitate public dissemination of this data, nor does it enable curatorial staff the ability to properly support researchers, educators, or the public in making effective use of the collections. the wyoming archaeological research and community hub (wyoarch) project seeks to resolve this situation through a collaboration between uwar and the wyoming geographic information science center (wygisc) to develop a public access interface to interact with a new spatially-enabled collections management system.
