“commingeoise”, a late medieval domestic ware of southern france, is a very current but problematic diagnostic artifact, as it has thus far been poorly defined. the chronology of its production is first of all not precisely established. furthermore, a simple macroscopic description has historically been used to identify this ceramic type. a more rigorous characterization is necessary in order to clearly define commingeoise. finally, although dispersed throughout a large and relatively well-defined geographic area, no production workshop of the commingeoise has been identified so far, and the domestically utilized pots characteristic of this ceramic type are generally produced locally. thereby, this research discusses new developments in answer to the questions on its origins, homogeneity, and organization of production and diffusion. 
to answer all these different issues, and to develop a broader understanding of commingeoise ware, this research employed multidisciplinary methods. a typo-chronological study was carried out to standardize chronological data on commingeoises. it was completed by technological study and experimental archaeology to identify the technologies used in the chaîne opératoire of this ceramic type. in addition, bulk chemical analysis (of both ceramics and sampled raw materials) and petrography enabled advancements in characterizing and determining the origins of commingeoise ware.
