in 2010, a tropical storm disturbed human remains and archaeological deposits at the fort frederik archaeological site, a multicomponent site consisting of dense 18th-19th century midden deposits associated with fort frederik, a two-story fortification (est. 1760) dating to the colonial development of st. croix, then a part of the danish west indies. subsequent investigations, including a geophysical survey, subsurface testing, and osteological analysis, have identified a cemetery within the site and clarified the chronological association of the disturbed remains. this presentation summarizes recent investigations, contributing to a broader understanding of the site, colonial st. croix, and events associated with emancipation.
