although archaeological field schools are widely accepted as a prerequisite for employment in the field, a disconnect has developed between universities sponsoring these courses and the instructors who teach them.  field schools are unique experiential learning opportunities, the value of which can be difficult to communicate to university administrators who set course minimum enrollments and summer tuition rates.  instead of just thinking of field schools as a means to teach skills necessary for future employment, archaeology instructors should engage with critical pedagogies that help us better translate the utility of field schools in an era of financial shortfalls and responsibility centered management budget models in higher education.  in this presentation, i discuss how the bighorn archaeology field school (indiana university) not only trains students in field techniques but also embraces a more critical approach by taking into account students' experiences and preconceptions.  the instructors frame discussions of ideology, race, culture, and landscape that shape perceptions of the western plains and mountains where they work, through media, fiction, and experience.  in addition, i argue that making use of the unique advantage of undergraduate students’ understanding of new social media platforms to engage with the public is beneficial for all parties involved.
