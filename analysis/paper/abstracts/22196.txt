the geometric structure of 17th through 19th century designed landscapes in virginia has been well documented archaeologically. the composition of elements in these landscapes shows how their designers manipulated geometric forms, architectural conventions, and standardized measurements to impose order in the garden. by the end of the 18th century fashionable american gardens tended towards irregular picturesque compositions, however the arrangement of individual garden elements to achieve that effect was rooted in the established traditions of geometric regularity. the interplay between these two styles can be seen explicitly at poplar forest, thomas jefferson’s retreat and plantation in bedford county, virginia. not only does the overarching structure of the designed landscape exhibit this quality but archaeological evidence also shows how geometric forms structured individual garden elements. archaeological remains of “tree clumps”, a staple of picturesque english landscapes, reveal jefferson’s use of various geometric forms to create a naturalistic composition. this paper will contextualize this archaeological evidence through a synthesis of period gardening treatises in jefferson’s possession and an examination of his other designed landscapes. the result is a more nuanced understanding of the evolution of early american garden design.
