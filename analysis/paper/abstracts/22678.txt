in the southeastern united states and elsewhere, indirect evidence of tobacco use is all too often inferred when archaeologists recover smoking pipes. thanks to the combined efforts of archaeologists and chemists, we have recently begun using gas chromotagraphy/mass spectrometry (gc/ms) analysis of residues scraped from the bowls of sooty pipes to make the connection directly. this paper is a spin-off of that larger effort to plot tobacco use in the pre-columbian southeast through space and time. it focuses specifically on the dozens of pipes recovered from the mississippian period moundville site of west-central alabama. pipes are not common at moundville, but they have been found in nearly all areas of the site – from household contexts in its crowded low-status neighborhoods, to its more sequestered precincts on and around mounds on the north side of the site. their distribution, the varied contexts of their recovery, and their array of forms add detail to our understanding of tobacco’s important role in the social, political, and religious lives of the moundville people.
