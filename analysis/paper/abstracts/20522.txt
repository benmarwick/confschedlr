households are the most important social unit in every society. the production and consumption of resources within the household can provide information on how resources were obtained, stored and distributed within the household or the community. recent archaeological research had provided significant information about the casma polity, which occupied the northern coast of peru between 700-1400 a.d. the casma society is viewed as a centralized polity that controlled several coastal valleys. although certain aspects of the casma society are still unknown, the research conducted at el campanario was oriented towards understanding the domestic life of the casma people. the excavations within the households at el campanario has provided baseline information that will aid in reconstructing the domestic activities related to food preparation and consumption as well as craft production. the craft activities identified at the site include pottery manufacture, textile production, maize beer preparation, and fishing.
