the limited territorial control of small states, here the classic maya, has hindered the development of political economies in several cases.  this paper looks at the issue of non-ruling elite interstate economic and political networks, and their effect on the evolution of internal political economies for the classic maya.  examples will be drawn from such polities as copan, el palmar, and caracol.  a further window into the dynamics of the effect of limited territorial control on political economies will also be drawn from similar examples among classical greek polities.
