boyd (2016) proposed four principal rules of interpretation for pecos river style rock art of the lower pecos region of texas. these rules were proposed based on a commonality between pecos river style and the iconography of historic corachol-aztecan speaking tribes such as the sixteenth century mexica of central mexico and the present-day huichol of western mexico. this presentation shows how the same rules can be applied to the interpretation of the rock art of other prehistoric corachol-aztecan speaking groups such as the jornada mogollon of new mexico, where, for example, their glyph for the sun contains certain linguistic characteristics that operate outside of mere symbology and are more of a depiction of the name of the sun than a representation of the sun itself.
