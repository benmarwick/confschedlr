during the 2017 field season of the uaxactun archaeological project new monument was excavated at buena vista, a minor center at uaxactun urban periphery. it is a small carved altar or ballcourt marker, which according to its style dates to the early classic. high quality of the carving and the hieroglyphic inscription indicates that the altar/marker itself was a part of the monumental corpus of uaxactun urban core; uncomplete text provides important new information on the dynastic history of the site. during the late/terminal classic it was moved and reutilized by the occupants of buena vista as a ballcourt marker. its importance probably lasted to the postclassic when it became the object of the veneration and unusual offering was placed associated with the monument.
