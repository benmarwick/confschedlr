experimental archaeology can be defined as the reconstruction of past buildings, technologies, objects and environmental contexts, their testing and use, so as to gain a better understanding of the role of material culture in people’s lives in the past. we explore ideas of craft, materiality, knowledge, skills and the use of different materials to practically test how people made, used and discarded things in the past. this paper will investigate how early medieval houses in europe can be understood in terms of construction, use and abandonment, using experimental archaeology, historical sources and archaeological sciences.
