los  ojitos (la 98907) is a hispanic new mexican site occupied between 1865 and 1950 on the pecos river in eastern new mexico. excavators recovered micaceous brownware sherds alongside american goods in household deposits and refuse scatters surrounding historic structures. a single ceramic type encompasses all micaceous wares found in the region: middle pecos micaceous brownware, dating ad 800–1300. a lack of typological guidelines for distinguishing prehistoric and historic micaceous sherds found at los ojitos limits site interpretation and throws into question all previous temporal assumptions about micaceous wares in the pecos river valley. research into micaceous ceramics in historic hispanic contexts sheds light on gendered, multi-ethnic trade economies and the persistence of indigenous ceramics alongside mass-produced tablewares in american-period eastern new mexico.
