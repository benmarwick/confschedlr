the conformation of the frontier in colonial times is well known historically, but poorly knows archaeologically specially in mexico. the camino real was the link between mexico city with santa fe. but this new territories were not only harsh geographically but dangerous by the constant raids by local communities of american indians, such as apaches or comanches, and presure from foraign nations like england, france and russia for new territories and resources. becouse of that the spanish empire establishes a military line of presidios (forts) from california to florida. several of these presidios were short lived, others become major cities today. thanks to the spanish buroacracy the description of the presidio is well know, but very few had been excavated to contrast the historical information. in mexico, the remains of few presidios stand in the isolated landscape such as the presidio san carlos, from them only a couple had been exploring archaeologically. this presidio is located near the community of manuel benavides, chihuahua, near the texan border. it's relative isolation contribute to its well preservation and present a good archaeological oportunity to explore and know more about the "presidiales" life and its relation with the landscape and local comunities.
