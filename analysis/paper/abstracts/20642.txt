in a previous paper, we examined past faunal studies from troumassoid period (ad 800-1600) sites in grenada, concluding that an expansion of diet breadth likely occurred during this time. our conclusion contradicted the traditional “crab-shell” dichotomy proposed by rainey and rouse, but confirmed findings from elsewhere in the caribbean. presented here is a continuation of this work, with new faunal analyses incorporated from recently excavated inland, western, and earlier (saladoid) sites, as well as faunal data from a few past reports that were recently discovered. currently, the data indicate differences between assemblages from the previously examined coastal troumassoid sites and the recently included inland occupations. a difference was also identified between all troumassoid sites and the earlier saladoid settlements. comparison of the faunal assemblages not only helps to enhance our understanding of grenada’s prehistoric environments, but also the communities that interacted with them. the differences between sites reveal local variations in subsistence strategies over time and further corroborate the transition to an expanded diet during the troumassoid period.
