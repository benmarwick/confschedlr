this paper presents the analysis of the ceramic practices of the tupiniquim people from peruíbe municipality, south shore of sao paulo (southeastern brazil), from xv to xviii century. during the xvi century that population lived in an area considered the cultural borders with the tupinambá population on the north and the guarani on the south. this fact allows us to identify some common morphological features on the ceramic, such as vessels for preparation of a fermented drink, pots with an accurate polychromic painting for serving food, and small spherical bows for consumption, among others. we performed a deep statistical treatment employing methods such as inference, cluster and correspondence analysis. the materiality suggests that the tupiniquim population persisted with their ceramic practices in a long-term historical period. there was a decrease in size of vessels and some technological changes, from the oldest to the most recent periods. this fact, may be related to a change of group organization, from multifamily domestic units, in pre-colonial period, to a few families group, after the establishment of the franciscan mission settlement in the xvii century.
