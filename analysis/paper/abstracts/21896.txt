castillo de huarmey on the north coast of peru is an archaeological site of pre-hispanic middle horizon period (ad 600-900), widely known for the discovery of the first undisturbed wari royal mausoleum. from 2012-2013 remains of fifty-eight elite female individuals were found accompanied by rich ceremonial offerings and grave goods, including textiles. the state of preservation and the condition of a large portion of the fabrics are poor, especially those coming from the primary burial contexts. however, technological analyses revealed the unique character of the textile collection, which utilized multiple and complex weaving techniques. these techniques were applied by highly skilled weavers to create sophisticated iconographic motifs, and even though there are only a few decorated and completely preserved textiles, analyses of smaller fragments enabled the reconstruction of complete patterns. comparison with fabrics discovered at the castillo de huarmey site before the first systematic excavations, as well as with motifs known from other archaeological contexts and collections, suggests strong cultural influences from the central and southern part of peru.
