Let’s Talk about the Dead and the Missing on the Latin American Migrant Trail: Deploying a Four-Field Anthropology in a Time of Crisis, Ignorance, and Refusal",Mesoamerica,Other,Forensic Archaeology,Migration,"While many misguided politicians and policy makers make dubious claims for the need to build a wall between Mexico and the United States for security purposes, few are willing to acknowledge the recent upsurge in the death and disappearance of migrants that is occurring both while traveling through Latin America and while attempting to cross the US/Mexico border. In this talk we present data from two ongoing research endeavors being carried out by the Undocumented Migration Project (UMP) that focus on these troubling issues. One is a photoethnography of Honduran migrants and smugglers crossing Mexico that seeks to understand the dangerous geography people must traverse en route to the US/Mexico border. The other is a forensic project that uses a range of survey and laboratory techniques to improve our ability to recover corpses from remote parts of the border and reconstruct the geographic origin and ante-mortem movement of unidentified bodies. Because of the complicated and clandestine nature of migrant movement and death, we posit that new and innovative ways of combining anthropological approaches are crucial to documenting these processes and raising awareness about this ongoing humanitarian crisis and the role that U.S. policy plays in border crosser deaths.",Symposium,Presenter,Jason_De Leon,3,11,3,Sa-afternoon

Historically, explanations of this important event have centered on relatively small geographic regions and traditional methodologies. This paper offers an alternative view at both a much larger scale and using distinct methods.

By the Middle Holocene archaeological record (c. 8000-4000 BP) shows marked differences between the technological, economic, and cultural practices of inland and coastal peoples. These differences, indicate the presence of two divergent adaptations: nomad canoe/marine hunter-gatherers and pedestrian terrestrial hunters, although the archaeological record shows several complementary economies. To date, proposed migration routes into Fuego-Patagonia include the Pacific rim, the Atlantic coast, and inland or intermountain corridors.  This study presents mtDNA results from 50 prehistoric individuals dated to ca. 6,000-390BP.

The initial human migration into the New World is an early human dispersal that has become a focal point in mobility research that strives to understand the impacts that climactic change and shifting environments have on human’s ability to successfully migrate and adapt to new lands.

Its incised limestone plateau and interior depression were left scarred by episodic pluvials throughout the Pleistocene and Early Holocene, when playa lakes filled interdunal basins and deep canyons flowed with seasonal runoff. The region fascinated medieval Arabic scholars, who speculated that the desiccated plain stretching from Hadramaut to Dhofar was the fabled land of Al Ahqaf, inhabited by a mythical people destroyed by ""the barren wind.""

Recent investigations have typically focused on the greening of Arabia and demographic response to increased landscape carrying capacity as the Indian Ocean Intertropical Convergence Zone shifted northward. Here we consider the inverse: what were the effects of increasing aridity on the environment and inhabitants of Arabia at the end of the Holocene Climatic Optimum? The current state of South Arabian early Neolithic archaeological and genetic research is summarized, superimposed over the palaeoenvironmental record describing a series of century scale megadroughts between ˜8,000 and 5,500 BP.

The goal of DAACS is to facilitate research that advances our historical understanding of the slave-based societies that evolved in the Atlantic World during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  In this paper we argue that the digital methods encapsulated within DAACS enable archaeologists to conduct innovative analysis at scales that would be impossible to achieve using analog methods.  These methods consist of: 1) entering archaeological data into the DAACS Research Consortium (DRC) Database Application using well-defined classification and measurement protocols, 2) serving that data for free through the DAACS website (www.daacs.org), and 3) providing training and assistance for those who conduct research with the data.  We offer three case studies to demonstrate how these methods enable collaborators to address old research questions using legacy collections, answer new questions with data from recent excavations, and adapt the system to incorporate data from different regions.  These case studies illustrate how DAACS has balanced the need to maintain rigorous data entry standards and reproducible methods with the needs of an expanding user base.",Symposium,Presenter,Elizabeth_Bollwerk,2.75,9,2.75,Sa-afternoon

",Iron Age,Remote Sensing/Geophysics,Landscape Archaeology,"This paper is an effort to create a predictive model for archaeological sites in an area of Eastern Botswana.  With a rather arid climate, much of Botswana’s ground surface (and archaeology) is easily visible to airborne and spaceborne sensors.  Without sufficient training data for supervised classification, an iterative spectral clustering method was used to group spectrally similar pixels from multispectral imagery into a large number of spectrally distinct but unknown classes. By visually assessing and removing classes that do not correlate with known sites in the region, the remaining classes provide a map for prospective site locations. This work illustrates how satellite imagery and digital remote sensing methods enable the inspection of large areas with little processing time, something that would be impossible from the ground in a single field-season. Also illustrated by this work is the need for on-the-ground inspection of the prospective sites to confirm their existence and to improve the model.",Symposium,Presenter,Forrest_Follett,2.75,9,2.75,Sa-afternoon

In all the excitement, discourse often focuses on digital data acquisition at the expense of archaeological analysis and interpretation. Some topics addressed include: (1) How digital technologies allow us to address research questions that would otherwise be “unanswerable”? (2) When do analog techniques better serve archaeology? (3) Is data digitization enough? What are we actually doing with all of our digitized legacy data?, (4) What are the challenges of adopting digital technologies? How do we overcome these challenges? and (5) In what cases can digital technologies readdress old research questions?

Excavations at this civic-administrative structure at the heart of the ceremonial core of Teotihuacan have revealed a sequence of numerous plaster floors in Plaza 50 associated with Structure 44, whose form is reminiscent of Classic Maya ""palace"" structures. Hundreds of small  mural fragments painted in Maya style were scattered beneath the deeper plaza floors, suggesting they were discarded there after the ritual destruction of at least one elaborately decorated earlier building. A contemporaraneous termination ritual offering found nearby, adjacent to Structure 25C, contained incised ceramics that are also clearly executed in Early Classic Maya style, with seated human figures bearing elaborate adornments and plumed headdresses.

Results from our analyses revealed intra-site variation among the general debitage fills and areas used for human caching and burnt offerings. One front, in particular, located along the Avenue of the Dead, featured a high concentration of human remains. These remains exhibited cranial deformation and some also teeth modifications atypical for Teotihuacan. Even further, one mound excavation revealed a burnt offering site where the zooarchaeological assemblage was predominately lagomorph and avian remains, mainly that of cottontail rabbit and partridge.

These explorations were supported by specialized analytical methods such as geophysical prospection, floor-chemistry studies, archaeomagnetic dating, as well as other forms of material analysis (paleobotany, zooarchaeology, bioarchaeology, lithics and ceramic analysis).
Architectural features were defined through trench and small-scale extensive excavations.

",Other,Cultural Resources and Heritage Management,Cultural Heritage and Preservation,"The 1990s, with quincentenary ‘celebrations’ and two highly influential Taino art exhibits in Paris and New York (the epicentres of the pre-Columbian art market), heralded a seismic increase of indigenous Caribbean art forgeries. But these weren’t the first indications of an emerging market: Caribbean forgeries had been circulating since at least the 1950s. The artistic heritage of the pre-Columbian Caribbean still remains largely understudied, with far smaller-scale production than seen in neighbouring regions like Mexico and Peru (with their own long-established, highly prolific forgers) – two of a number of factors that have led not only to site looting but entrepreneurial ‘reinterpretations’ of ancient artforms, both aimed at filling voids in private collections. These neo-artforms eventually enter museum collections, and are published in glossy catalogues as the genuine article, perpetuating the continuation of a particular forger’s oeuvre, cementing it as an established, ancient ‘style’, and so skewing understanding of past artistic expressions and meanings. The forger's craft has become increasingly sophisticated, deceptive and profitable.

In 2014, the Carriacou Archaeology Project (University of Oregon; University of London) excavated a unique stone zemi at the Grand Bay site on the island of Carriacou, Grenada. The decision was made to create casts of the zemi in order to facilitate simultaneous display of the object in multiple island museums. It was hoped this would allow both museums to advocate the small island of Carriacou as a site of particular archaeological significance, to stimulate scientific tourism and promote the research potential of the island to post-graduates.
However, the making of the casts has raised some potentially problematic issues. The original intention was that the museums would display the casts correctly labelled as copies. This has not happened, raising the question as to whether or not the casts are moving from being mere “replicas” to being fakes: copies which deceive - however unintentionally or benignly. And because the casts increase the “visibility” of the original they are adding new layers of economic and aesthetic value to the original – with potential implications for theft, forgery and looting.",Symposium,Presenter,John_Swogger,2,7,2,Sa-afternoon

",Other,Cultural Resources and Heritage Management,Iconography and Art,"Authenticating relations are defined by artisanship, temporality, value-making and ethnographic authority. These relations are visible in contemporary museum settings as well as in the art world as such, and may be particularly poignant in the case of the Caribbean and Central America with its diverse manifestations of emotive styles and materials such as wood and stone. Historically deep and widespread, 19th and 20th century Central American trafficking of pre-Columbian things was tied to foreign-owned plantations and centred on San Jose, Costa Rica, leading to a scarcity of a ‘Nicaragua’ provenance indicator in current-day museum signage. Eventually, archaeology emerged from such uncontrolled collecting and now works to counter looting, yet market demand for objects remains stable. 
This paper explores the ongoing resilience of authenticity and its persistence in the global art market. I argue that this is in part due to the ascribed inspirational value Amerindian objects hold in modern art, as argued in the notion of primitivism. Primitivist art is seen in opposition to modernity, ascribing it legitimacy through temporal or cultural distance. With some exceptions, programs focussed on revitalizing artisanship and producing high-quality copies or working on stylistic and technical innovations are countered by rendering this primitive authenticity.

",Other,Cultural Resources and Heritage Management,Cultural Heritage and Preservation,"Collectors of antiquities have long sought the ornate pottery and carved wood and stonework of the pre-Columbian Caribbean - a quick search for “Saladoid” or “Taino” on internet gallery/auction sites shows a thriving black market. Its scale has remained largely unexplored, to the detriment of regional and international archaeology and museology. In response to the increasingly growing market, various attempts have been made to discourage looting via replica workshops, community archaeology, and other interventions. Many efforts prove unsustainable, however, and in some cases participants were left with the skills to both identify Amerindian remains and create forgeries that eventually end up on display in museums. This symposium will examine the unintended consequences, cautionary tales, and lessons learned from an often overlooked – but highly prolific - region of the antiquities market. In the process, we will illuminate new understandings and strategies for both combating the global antiquities trade and encouraging sustainable economic impacts for those who make a living creating new art forms, inspired by the past yet reinterpreted for the present.",Symposium,Chair (Primary),Joanna_Ostapkowicz,2,7,2,Sa-afternoon

Foodways-the ways we produce, prepare, and consume foods-are an important part of human society and culture and play a vital role in making and maintaining social relationships.  In the US Southwest, ceramic vessels were essential tools in nearly every task associated with the production, preparation, and consumption of food, making them an ideal source of data for understanding changes in food practices at multiple scales. Different uses of similar ceramic forms between contemporaneous settlements suggest persistent diversity in certain cuisine practices, while cross-cutting shifts in the sizes of ceramic bowl and jar forms hint at the widespread social and political importance of food in communal life in these periods.",Symposium,Presenter,Sarah_Oas,2.75,9,2.75,Sa-afternoon

This is especially true in the archaeological record, where human beliefs and worldviews must be understood through material correlates. In order to make categories simpler to use, Western scholars have tended to dichotomize religious and secular. Exploring the role of Mesa Verde style mugs in the Ancestral Puebloan world, this paper takes an object biography approach and acknowledges that boundaries between religious and secular practices are not always clear cut.  Researchers tend to consider Mesa Verde style mugs an object used primarily in religious ritual contexts. However, their investigations have assumed an unnecessary dichotomy between domestic/secular and religious/ceremonial uses. By using an object biography approach, I work to collapse the boundaries between religious and secular practices and show that mugs had multiple roles in the lives of Ancestral Puebloan people.",Symposium,Presenter,Kathryn_Putsavage,2.75,9,2.75,Sa-afternoon

This paper examines the deposition of whole vessels and ceramic sherds from Cerro de Trincheras, Sonora, Mexico. It compares two contexts: the debris of domestic spaces, and the careful internment of vessels as part of mortuary ritual. The ceramic deposition practices of Trinchereños (Trincheras Tradition peoples) reveal the life history of the pots themselves. Despite the ubiquity of pottery by 1300 AD, Trinchereños treated their vessels with great care and consideration, vessels were mended, repurposed and included in burial assemblages showing the cumulative effects of their life histories. These insights provide context for understanding domestic refuse. While sherds help date the site and track migration, archaeologists have incomplete knowledge of how Trinchereños used pots in their daily lives. In this paper, I will discuss the deposition of Trincheras funerary ceramics as they relate to household assemblages.

While this pottery is ubiquitous in the 14th- to 15th-century Tonto Basin, contemporaneous sites otherwise show substantial differences in material culture and were likely home to diverse populations. Along with a broader examination of variation in Roosevelt Red Ware vessel forms and use among sites, exploring the techniques used to make these vessels in relationship to deep histories of ceramic production can shed new light on the place of this pottery in social diversity in the Tonto Basin and the greater Southwest.",Symposium,Presenter,Katherine_Dungan,2.75,9,2.75,Sa-afternoon

This is especially true for the Phoenix Basin Hohokam, where ceramic provenance studies have revolutionized archaeologists’ abilities to understand the organization of pottery production and distribution, but the human labor involved in ceramic transport has been mostly only implied or obliquely referenced.  
In this paper, I employ an Archaeology of the Human Experience (AHE) framework to explore the labor involved in ceramic exchange among the Phoenix Basin Hohokam during the middle Sacaton period (ca. A.D. 1000-1070), when the volume and extent of this exchange were at their peak. Through a case study from the site of Las Colinas, I focus on situating and investigating the labor of ceramic exchange as a condition of life for the middle Sacaton period Hohokam, considering how this labor was part of and affected broader social contexts, and exploring bodily, social, and temporal aspects of the experience of ceramic transport, drawing upon archaeological and ethnographic examples.

The sequence of production may be easy to infer but the duration of each step is elusive. For instance, archaeologists have yet to devise a method for estimating how long potters spent painting vessels. In the American Southwest, Ancestral Pueblo potters seem to have invested considerable time in these pursuits. Drawing on ethnoarchaeological scholarship, Pueblo ethnographies, and experimental archaeology, I present a new method that estimates minimum painting duration based on the organization and structure of brushstrokes.

CE), South Central Veracruz was a mosaic of microstates, in which obsidian was scarce but available to everyone. Semi-intensive systematic survey in 400 km2 of the lower Cotaxtla basin showed occasional concentrations that led to propose two alternatives: state-controlled workshops obtaining and redistributing artifacts to resident population, or independent workshops servicing clients across borders, implying the existence of a market-based economy.
 
Chaîne opératoire analysis shows that, while obsidian sources (Zaragoza-Oyameles for prismatic blades and Pico de Orizaba for percussion flakes), core types and knapping techniques are identical across the survey region, there is a high incidence and a wide variety of knapping errors. The evidence reflects a well established procurement system coupled to a low degree of specialization, which opens the possibility of a third alternative: state procurement of raw material (acquired using surplus of commercial staple like cotton, cacao, or rubber), with limited individual household access and production of artifacts.

Previous research on obsidian production found a spatial association with Sauce, which could support political administration of exchange, or alternatively, identify market exchange nearby. Reliance on spatially based models alone for identifying exchange mechanisms are flawed based on equifinality, in which different forms of exchange result in the same spatial pattern. Local chipped stone artifacts have further complications to interpretation: singular geological source, universal access, and potential specialized activities. No single model will identify all competing influences on residential inventories. To handle this complexity, I use the articulation of production combined with the spatial distribution and contextual information to distinguish between redistribution and market exchange. Results indicate that market exchange was the main mechanism. The largest concentrations of primary production indicators were found near Sauce, along with the highest quantities of blade parts, which suggests that political elites encouraged market exchange even if they did not direct it.",Symposium,Presenter,Alanna_Ossa,2.75,10,2.75,Sa-afternoon

Despite this, and almost a decade of regional survey and targeted excavation by PiLab, relatively low quantities of obsidian artifacts have been recovered within the study area. In our analyses of obsidian exploitation, we focus on evaluating both the overall quantities of obsidian artifacts recovered and their specific uses. Our results suggest that access to imported obsidian was rather limited throughout most of the region of study.

The examinations of faunal remains of seabirds, sea mammals, and mollusk shells support the expected marine-oriented subsistence strategy. However, the site also contains a long record of botanical remains suggesting that people had access to plant resources. For this reason, a study of fossil pollen grains and macrobotanical remains have been carried out with the focus on reconstructing the paleoethnobotanical record of Gramalote. These two botanical proxies help to identify the relationships between humans and plants in this region of northern Peru during the second millennium B.C.

As largely substrate-specific in nature, fungal spores may serve as proxy for a range of phenomena, such as soil erosion, landscape burning, vegetation clearance, moisture availability, and the existence of particular plant types in a given area. Microbotanicals, including pollen, fungal spores, phytoliths, and microcharcoal, isolated from a 2.5 meter sediment core recovered from Kingwal Swamp in western Kenya are used here to demonstrate the value of fungal palynomorphs as environmental indicators, particularly when employed in concert with these more traditional proxy types. I illustrate how cross-checking of palynological interpretations with fungal data can be used to refine models of landscape change and increase interpretive confidence via the elimination of equifinal trajectories potentially responsible for observed archaeological and paleoecological data patterning.

Because of the difficulty of becoming familiar with the vast array of microfossils found in a typical pollen sample, non-pollen palynomorphs (such as fungal spores) are often overlooked in traditional palynological analyses. However, they can be indicators of various environmental changes such as fluctuations in plant and animal communities, erosion and fire events. This paper demonstrates the utility of fungal spores as paleoenvironmental proxies at two submerged sites in the Southeastern United States: Page-Ladson, Florida and White Pond, South Carolina. Non-pollen palynomorph assemblages at these sites provide evidence of considerable disturbances to vegetation, including fires, grazing and browsing regimes, and periods of erosion. Of particular interest are the coprophilous fungal spores, which indicate a decline in megaherbivores at both sites by ~12,600 cal BP.

During the past decade, some scientists have turned to using other techniques such as DNA and isotopes of pollen grains to gain information about the above research goals.

Vaughn Bryant was among the first researchers in the region to use pollen data to build paleoclimatic and ecological chronologies from this region, his dissertation is still one of the most comprehensive analyses of this region’s ecological past. Following this path, my dissertation focuses on Conejo Shelter, which Bryant also worked on in his graduate student days, back in the late 1960s. This rockshelter has a substantial, but under-studied assemblage of perishable artifacts including basketry, cordage, sandals, and coprolites. Thirty new, direct dates, using material from fiber sandals and coprolites, have formed the basis of a more fine-tuned radiocarbon chronology for Conejo Shelter. Esri ArcGIS has been used to incorporate new chronological data with information from the original excavation notes, in order to visualize the site’s stratigraphy, better understand changes in the perishable assemblage through time, and track potential migrations of people and ideas between the Lower Pecos and adjacent regions.

This problem of “being miscellaneous” continues despite the role of paleoethnobotanists as vital members of research teams. One of the impacts of being a sideline speciality is the lack of structured training programs to develop the botanical knowledge  alongside a standard curriculum in archaeology. Most undergraduates receive basic training in lithic or ceramic identification during field schools. However, paleoethnobotanical skills are not as frequently taught. Most training in paleoethnobotany has taken the form of a mentorship, often at great personal cost to the student. A great example of this is the summer Vaughn Bryant travelled from Texas to Canada for a summer at his own expense to study coprolite research under Eric Callen. These hours of one on one instruction under the fume hood, in front of the microscope, or in plant communities prepare students to become professionals who go on to establish their own research programs.

I focus on three facets of the material expression of emigration: the things they bring, the worlds they build, and the resulting influences they have ‘back home.’ Using the prism of local and regional experiences, I demonstrate how these acts of object-movement reflect wider narratives of national and international affect. Namely, how those emigrated objects reflect perceived values within a country; how the materiality of public and private spheres displays multifaceted identities and engagement with particular (and often overlapping) communities; and the ways in which emigrants shape, through remittances, letters, and return, the narratives of expectation and acts of consumption practiced ‘back home.’ By looking at the ways in which networks and social identities are expressed in the materiality of emigrant’s lives, I aim to engage with the complex narratives of trans-locational experiences, and the act of movement, from an archaeological lens.",Symposium,Presenter,Nicholas_Ames,4,14,4,Sa-afternoon

Along the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Irish immigrants constructed several cuts and tunnels, including the Blue Ridge Tunnel. At its completion, the tunnel measured 4,263ft long and bridged two Virginia counties. This project proved to be an especially daunting task that took ten years to complete and cost many lives. Workers and their families nearby were forced to live in groups of shanty homes, prone to regular outbreaks of disease throughout construction. In 2011, a local non-profit organization, focused on pinpointing the remains of these Irish shanty homes, contacted the University of Maryland to see if an archaeological survey could aid their search.

Irish immigrants lived in every ward of Philadelphia as newcomers from various European countries settled along alleyways and courtyards throughout the city. Using Elfreth’s Alley National Historic Landmark as a case study, this paper argues that the dispersion, intermingling, and lack of segregation between immigrant groups in Philadelphia had implications for how newcomers navigated daily life and how the material culture they left behind can be interpreted as representations of material identity. A diverse population of European immigrants shared living spaces along Elfreth’s Alley during the nineteenth century, including residents from Ireland, Germany, England, Spain, Russia, the Czech Republic, and more. Archaeological investigations at two properties along the Alley did not unearth artifacts discretely linked to “Irishness,” rather an examination of the material culture of the built environment revealed common features across domestic spaces shared by immigrants from different ethnic backgrounds.

Settlers on the Wisconsin frontier in the mid-to-late 19th century had limited access to formal health care. Physicians who did provide services to remote populations were often poorly trained and had a limited understanding of the causes of many diseases. Thus, self-medication and alternative forms of health care became an attractive option for many frontier occupants. As a result of rapid industrialization during this period, many groups of immigrants were forced to abandon their ancestral ethnic identities and assimilate to a more homogeneous capitalistic American culture. This paper illustrates how patent medicine bottles recovered from the McHugh site provide an indication of how the McHugh family responded to the need for health care under the harsh conditions of frontier life in northeastern Wisconsin during the mid-to-late 19th century.

While archaeologists have explored the myriad ways that mass-produced goods circulated throughout the British Empire through networks of trade and exchange, less attention has been given to the way specifically British manufactured goods were incorporated into meaningful practices of material consumption within Irish communities. This project investigates how these industrially produced consumer products became woven into the social, religious, and cultural fabric of daily life in the Irish island communities of Inishark and Inishbofin from the late 18th century to the present day. Recent archaeological investigations by the Cultural Landscapes of the Irish Coast project on Inishark and Inishbofin, combined with the oral history of island residents, will further an understanding of the significant ways that mass-produced consumer goods were meaningfully incorporated into island life through the collection of delph (ceramics) on household dressers, and consumption of tobacco pipes in everyday life and during traditional Irish wakes.

Race and low “moral character” were blamed for the endemic poverty of the island. The Irish poor were portrayed as a “race apart” whose inherent failings were at least partly to blame for the mortality they suffered during the Great Famine of 1845–1852. Recent excavations at Kilkenny workhouse and Spike Island convict prison have produced skeletal assemblages from this critical period. These collections have enabled bioarchaeological analysis of parameters mentioned by the Victorians as indicative of the distinctiveness of the Irish poor: stature, interpersonal violence, and tobacco-use. We argue that the differences between Irish and British populations in stature and risk of violence were exaggerated. Such characterizations, we suggest, were part of a strategy of “othering” that served to legitimize colonial domination.

This paper presents results of an analysis of the teaware component of the McHugh ceramic assemblage that attempted to identify potential markers of traditional pre-immigration behaviors. Since tea is consumed by cultures across the world, the presence of teaware alone is not enough to indicate “Irishness.” Thus, this study explores the correlates of the material manifestation of tea consumption within the McHugh household and offers a comparison with selected contemporary sites as well as modern Irish and Irish American households. The aim of this study is to discover if there is an inherently Irish style of tea consumption and to determine whether or not the associated behaviors can inform our understanding of the McHugh assemblage.",Symposium,Presenter,Alexander_Anthony,4,14,4,Sa-afternoon

These islanders left their homes, the seascapes that framed their lives, and entered into a new placelessness.  To Irish islanders living and working in America, crafts such making fishing nets, provided a point of entry into the emotional landscape of memory and belonging.  Nets were not just economic tools or objects; rather these practice helped islanders make their past meaningful through the repeated reenacting of crafts, and negotiate their place in the New World.  Migration is, above all else, a dissociative event, one that fundamentally challenges an individuals sense of place, of home, and identity, and creates moments in which individuals reside in one place, but “belong” in another place.  Combining oral history, folklore and documentary records, we discuss how the film Nets of Memory (Líonta na Cuimhne) explores how a 19th century Islander from Inishark, County Galway, Ireland, continued to make fishing nets for 40 years after emigrating to Clinton, MA.",Symposium,Presenter,William_Donaruma,4,14,4,Sa-afternoon

In these courses, students use weather data from specific sites in an assigned world region to do trend analyses to speculate on past or future climatic conditions.

Archaeology courses that discuss climate change typically bring together data from the physical sciences, such as from ice or lake cores, with archaeological evidence of social change, such as shifting settlement patterns or food strategies. Though an understanding of these links is critical to scientific literacy and knowledge about the past, we suggest that an ethnographic perspective can deeply enrich student learning by revealing social processes beyond subsistence-based adaptations. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in rural communities in Peru, we first review how local people perceive the causes and effects of climate change, including through the lens of religious belief. Second, we draw on archaeological and available ice core evidence from the region that reveal how ancient people adapted to shifting flows of water: an ongoing process that continues today. Ultimately, we suggest that the diverse kinds of knowledge that ethnography, archaeology, and paleoclimatology produce—and the multiple ways of knowing the world that each provides—is essential for students to consider when learning about not only what happened during moments of climate change in the past, but how societies creatively responded.",Symposium,Presenter,Doris_Walter,3,10,3,Sa-afternoon

This paper combines aspects of each of these interests. Cemeteries associated with Indian mounds commonly occur in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. Numerous reasons have been put forth over the years as to why early Anglo-American settlers decided to bury their dead on mounds, ranging from flooding issues, to avoidance of valuable farmland, to a preference for burying on high land. The fact that a number of mound sites along the bluffs of western Mississippi also have non-Indian cemeteries on them, despite even higher land occurring nearby, suggests that the story is far more complex than perceived. I suggest here that the use of mounds for burial purposes may be related to early nineteenth-century Anglo-American populations having made symbolic power statements over land that was still either being occupied or claimed by Indians. The erection of gravestones on prehistoric mounds targeted what were clearly the most visible and curious monuments of this contested landscape.

This paper uses current ceramic materials analysis techniques and case studies from the Rio Grande and Casas Grandes regions of the Greater Southwest to explore how mid-century taxonomic units, such as “type,” “variety,” and “mode,” can have continuing usefulness as conceptual frameworks for understanding pottery technology and production sequences as socially learned and culturally embedded practice. We reconstruct these shared communities of knowledge and practice at varying local, regional, and inter-regional scales and discuss how these practices inform our archaeological perception of standard cultural historical typological categories.

He also had a deep interest in the emergence of the discipline of anthropology in the United States, especially the use of ceramic analysis to systematize cultural chronologies and culture history. Williams developed a popular course on pseudoscience, using archaeology to teach hundreds of students the value of skepticism and the skills of critical thinking.

This article encompassed his research in the Gulf of Fonseca, where he spent a field season surveying and excavating sites in 1964-65. Fifty-three years later, this article still constitutes one of the most extensive descriptions of the ceramic assemblage of the Honduran side of the Gulf. However, research in the surrounding regions of the Gulf in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras, has considerably advanced in the last thirty years, and contributed to a better understanding of ceramic types and their distribution. Through a renewed analysis of a sample of the ceramic material excavated by Baudez in the Gulf of Fonseca and a review of his typology, my paper presents updated considerations about distribution of ceramic types present in the Gulf of Fonseca between the Classic and Late Post-Classic periods, with a focus on the Late and Terminal Classic. To this end, recent research and established typologies are reviewed and compared as an attempt to create relations and equivalences between types, leading to better understanding of local variations.

With its location inside the interaction sphere between Mesoamerica, Lower Central America and the Caribbean, it lies within a culturally dynamic region that has received influences from various areas during different times. With respect to the Postclassic period, it has been demonstrated that access and distribution patterns of resources and goods changed and new networks of interaction emerged. Communication routes along the coast gained importance. In Guadalupe, many objects were found that point to cultural and economic relations with Mesoamerica and Lower Central America, suggesting that the settlement might have functioned as a coastal trading center.

",Intermediate Area,Remote Sensing/Geophysics,Landscape Archaeology,"In response to the widespread destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, the US Geological Survey conducted an extensive survey of 15 modern cities in Honduras. This 2000 survey was carried out by the Bureau of Economic Geology of the University of Texas, and the resultant data were used to generate flood risk maps. The survey also produced the first lidar data collection of a Maya site; however, in the early 2000s, lidar algorithms were not capable of performing the same tasks as today. The final elevation rasters that were archived by the USGS were low resolution and had very basic ground/non-ground classification which made archaeological interpretation difficult. Over the past two years semi-raw lidar data was recovered from old magnetic tapes. We have been able to reprocess these data using current algorithms at a level suitable for archaeological investigation. The newly processed data provides unique insight into Honduran archaeological sites as well as settlement patterns throughout a large part of the country. This paper discusses these lidar data from better-known locations such as Copan, the Sula and Comayagua Valleys, and from less-studied areas along the Atlantic Coast, the Aguan and Olancho Valleys, and the southern gulf of Fonseca region.",Symposium,Presenter,Juan C._Fernandez Diaz,4,15,4,Sa-afternoon

",Intermediate Area,Ceramic Analysis,Frontiers and Borderlands,Prehispanic populations of northeastern Honduras were positioned at the border of Mesoamerica and Lower Central America. Previous research on ceramic style suggests local affiliation shifted over time from north to south as part of an adept strategy to navigate the complex political and social landscape of the region through the promotion of an inclusive group identity. This study explores the actual implementation of that strategy by investigating communal feasting contexts where symbolically significant ceramics were used and incorporates new information about local identity and affiliation through a complementary study of foodways. Tracing changes in these traditions over time elucidates the ways in which these materials were articulated in practice to create enduring symbols of identity.

In prehistory, this landscape was imbued with cultural meaning in a variety of ways, from the monumental to the perishable. This paper presents and discusses what we know about the rock art of central and southern Honduras, which contains a variety of iconographic rock art styles within a very limited spatial scale. The location and content of these sites suggest the inhabitants of this part of Honduras assigned multiple, often overlapping meanings to major features of the landscape, particularly caves and waterways.

The belief that the periphery was occupied by simple non-Maya societies, lightly “influenced” by their more civilized western neighbors, appeared early in the development of orthodox frameworks and continues to influence archaeological perspectives. The advent of World Systems Theory and other core-periphery perspectives brought an interest in the character of the relationships but little advance in attention to the material remains that might reflect the supposed derivative nature of frontier cultural patterns.  

Understanding interaction requires methodologies that move beyond unilateral region-to-region or community-to-community connections and focus instead on the development of innovative approaches to documenting multiple overlapping networks connecting many groups within many communities. Taking ceramic systems as our focal point, we explore the potential of pottery to map links among lower Ulúa valley groups and their counterparts in adjacent regions. Delineating the distributions of these likely traces of interaction illustrates a new and more sensitive framework for assessing the movement of ideas and things in a complex landscape.

The relationship between cultural occupation sites and river dynamics over the Holocene is poorly known in this region. Lateral and vertical river stability can be an important determinate of land use and settlement patterns. We investigate the geomorphic record of the Qujiang in relation to the Hehuashan river terrace occupation site using geophysical methods (GPR) and cores on the adjacent floodplain to infer long-term floodplain stability. Floodplain structure is dominated by shallow narrow channels comprised of basal gravels and sand (   4 m depth), overlain by horizontally laminated infilled silty sands. We interpret the long-term natural channel pattern of the Qujiang to be a cobble-bedded, sandy anabranched river, subject to rapid and frequent lateral channel shifting and formation of large back-swamps during heavy flooding.

",Neolithic,Other,Subsistence and Foodways: Domestication,"This symposium highlights progress being made by the collaborative Shangshan Culture Project based in the Lower Yangtze Valley of Zhejiang Province, China. The Shangshan Culture, identified just over a decade ago, was responsible for the first steps to agriculture in the region, if not all southern China. This symposium outlines our current understanding of the material culture, settlement, chronology, human ecology. geoarchaeology, and palaeoethnobotany of the culture, with emphasis on the Shangshan, Huxi, and Qiaotou sites.  Shangshan dates to ca. 12,000-8,400 BP and is ancestral to the Neolithic Kuahuqiao and Hemudu Cultures. The Shangshan culture established substantial communities in elevated (40-100 m above sea level), intermountain river valleys well away from where the Kuahuqiao and Hemudu cultures eventually became established. Questions being addressed include what economically supported the occupations, how settlements were organized, the function and palaeoecology of substantial ditches at several Shangshan sites, the process of rice domestication, the meaning and technical skills behind the many forms of Shangshan pottery (including fibre tempered and thin, painted/slipped ware), and the relationships the occupations had with each other and to subsequent cultural developments in Zhejiang Province

His research and courses covered prehistoric and historic archaeology of the Old World and New World, the ethnography of native North and South America, and the anthropology of law. As a student of Aidan Treganza at San Francisco State, and then of Melvin Aikens at Oregon, John’s early research focused on the prehistory of the West Coast. During his 34 years at Youngstown State, John developed an expertise in industrial archaeology, with a focus on 19th century blast furnaces. Through work on historic and prehistoric sites in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, and in Israel and Central America, John gave several generations of students an array of opportunities. In addition, he made archaeology accessible to grade school and high school students through programs in summer camps. Each field project was an opportunity to share the excitement of archaeology with students whom he mentored and groomed carefully, and to satisfy his scholarly interests.

In particular, we focus on how the use of bedrock afforded the construction of a ‘lived’ place. By looking at the materiality of its intrinsic properties, we argue that the Mixtecs of Etlatongo intentionally used bedrock as part of construction episodes in the formation of a public space so that its symbolic properties were able to emerge with the building’s form and history. Considering that ethnographic accounts mention that Mixtecs understood reality as an indivisible whole animated with sacred life forces, we examine the ways in which this existential unity manifested during construction events and through the life histories of buildings; we link our Cruz B example with ethnographic practice through subsequent construction episodes at Etlatongo that illustrate the abiding interest in certain attributes of bedrock.

The history of lithic analysis has produced many assumptions and interpretations regarding exchange, use and control of this extremely important material. Obsidian itself, as an imported resource, might have had otherworldly properties that held a special place in the cosmological construction of the world for villagers in the Valley of Oaxaca. The power of higher status community members may have been channeled through these distinct and imported materials, including obsidian. The recent excavations at Etlatongo, in the Mixteca Alta, have provided an opportunity to test these models and utilize new theoretical perspectives. Samples of obsidian excavated at Etlatongo, from both domestic and public space, demonstrate long distant relationships that the village, and specific households, may have developed in order to procure obsidian. We also explore the crafting of the material itself. Etlatongo also gives us the opportunity to systematically test distribution and frequency levels throughout the site, to determine if there was any control or redistribution over certain obsidian sources, which would be indicative of the economic and other-worldly importance of obsidian at Early Formative Etlatongo.

Therefore, we assess the impact of agriculture within the Middle Formative (850 – 400 BC) population from the Mixtec prehispanic society from Etlatongo, located in the Nochixtlán Valley, Oaxaca. We use archaeological and bioarchaeological data to evaluate health of 21 individuals and compare them with other skeleton collections within the same time period, from the Mixteca Alta, Valley of Oaxaca and the Coastal regions, all from Oaxaca.

BCE), Rome underwent rapid urbanization with concomitant social changes. This shift from modest settlement to urban center affected how animals were raised, distributed, and consumed. Namely, large-scale animal sacrifice rituals within the city acted as a new mechanism for distributing meat to the masses, provided by centralized authorities.

Specifically, this paper examines the incorporation of isolated skeletal elements into ritual spaces, contextualizing this practice within the broader scope of Late Bronze Age human-animal relationships.

A variety of ancestor rituals, work parties, and other large-scale commensal events occurred in large public spaces in high status compounds at Cerro León.

Employing intrasite spatial analysis, I explore the movements through various spaces, public and private, that provided opportunities for social interaction or restrictions on visibility and community integration. Drawing on archaeobotanical and ethnohistorical evidence, I argue that household members (likely women) primarily prepared food in private behind-the-scenes contexts for supra-household ritual events and public displays.

 Evidence from the site of Markaqocha, in the Cusco region of Peru, both corroborates and complicates arguments that link religious and ecological conversion. At Markaqocha, archaeological, historical, and paleo-environmental data provide a lens on Inka and Colonial ritual economies. These data suggest that while the intervention of religious organizations was critical to initial attempts to convert from an Inka to Spanish political ecology, the connections this process affirmed between ritual spaces and agricultural production later prompted conflict between secular and religious institutions. Further, data from Markaqocha suggest that attempts at such a conversion were not entirely successful.

Reasons for more frequent identification of ritual sacrifices and feasts vary, but two driving forces certainly are archaeological context, bones found in or near special architecture, and the cultural milieu formed by the region’s ancient textual record. In contrast, I have a skeptical tale to tell of ritual production and consumption. This tale takes place at the site of Hazor, a Bronze and Iron Age city mound in Israel. The site has all the correct elements to demonstrate ancient food-related rituals: It was a city of great size and importance; a place where excavations have revealed temples and/or impressive palaces, cuneiform texts and statues of gods; and which produced large bone assemblages. Yet archaeozoological analyses demonstrate a disjuncture between bone patterning on one hand and expectations set by texts and contexts on the other.

",Other,Mortuary Analysis,Monumentality,"In eastern Africa, herding was the earliest form of food production, supplanting fishing-hunting-gathering around Lake Turkana (northwest Kenya) ca. 5000-4000 BP. Fueled by the dramatic recession of Lake Turkana 5300-3900 BP, which made fishing less predictable and exposed vast plains of rich pasture near the lake, early herding probably involved both in-migration of pastoralists and adoption of livestock by local fishers. As herding took hold a mortuary tradition developed, with megalithic ‘pillar sites’ serving as communal cemeteries. Construction (massive platforms, mortuary cavities >100m2 dug into sandstone bedrock, and columnar stones hauled up to 1 km from their source) and use (interment of several hundred estimated individuals over a few centuries, accompanied by adornments and intricately decorated pottery) attest to the sites’ commemorative significance. As physical landmarks and settings for unifying rituals, pillar sites would have anchored early herders within an otherwise fluid physical and social landscape as Lake Turkana retreated, rainfall diminished, and mobility increased. Periodic assembly of otherwise dispersed groups to perform ritualized interment would have facilitated diverse forms of social interaction—including information sharing, formation of exchange networks, and negotiations and strategic decisions about herd movements—essential to the success of early pastoral economies in eastern Africa.",Symposium,Presenter,Elisabeth_Hildebrand,4,16,4,Sa-afternoon

Here, new data generated from recent faunal and isotopic studies are interpreted to infer the organization of pastoral production, circulation, and consumption.  While economic and ecological models offer valuable insights into the adoption and practice of pastoralism in Gujarat, a comprehensive understanding of this process must incorporate consideration of the possible roles that livestock, especially cattle, played in the ritual life of local communities.

Drawing on emerging archaeobotanical evidence from the Ravni Kotari region of southern Croatia, this paper discusses the challenges of understanding continuities of cultivation practices over multiple millennia in relation to changing political-economic contexts within which cultivation has taken place. I emphasize the production of Olea europea and Vitis vinifera, two non-subsistence crops that emerged as central components of market-oriented production under the Roman Empire, and continue to provide the basis of commercial agriculture in the region today. The long-term transmission of these cultivars is complex. The ritual use of wine and oil within the Christian church may have sustained the cosmological importance of these crops through the geopolitically turbulent medieval period, while their commercial importance diminished. More recently, viticulture and oleiculture have become emblematic of “traditional” folk life and agricultural heritage, their consumption ritualized in new ways through agritourism. Ritual offers a lens for considering both the shifting social meanings of cultivated plants, as well as how and why certain practices can be sustained across social, cultural, and political disjuncture.",Symposium,Presenter,James_Countryman,4,16,4,Sa-afternoon

It traces the archaeological evidence of how religious ideologies, social group divisions, and agricultural technologies shifted together during this process of community formation, including how ritual and food production practices and materials were integrated into particular events and local spaces. It concludes that the integration of these practices was essential to establishing common goals, consent, and material dependencies between a community of builders, ritual participants, and food producers.

Food production, as a range of coordinated activities, is critical to the organization of society. Yet because it is necessary for survival, scholars often isolate it as a domain of domestic subsistence. Nonetheless, numerous ethnohistoric and modern accounts detail the important role that communal rituals had in organizing these activities, such as the intricate ritual-agricultural calendar of the Inka state or the elaborate water temple ceremonies in Bali. While these accounts articulate the sacred significance of food production practices and the collective rituals that organized them, these links are less commonly explored archaeologically. For example, although archaeologists often discuss the cultural meanings of consumption or the political economy of production-storage-redistribution cycles, few have addressed how rituals were perceived as essential to food production technologies. In turn, scholars often overlook how diverse kinds of labor, from ritual to food production, interlinked to organize ancient societies. By attending to these interconnections, papers in this symposium contribute to our anthropological knowledge of the complex practices that link people, plants, animals, land, water, and things and to address the imbrication of “sacred,” “community,” and “socioeconomic” landscapes and practices throughout the ancient world.",Symposium,Chair (Primary),Rebecca_Bria,4,16,4,Sa-afternoon

Many civilian wartime burials are located in Internally Displaced Person’s (IDP) camps, mass graves, or as skeletal surface scatters throughout the landscape. These forms of burials constitute a violation of traditional Acholi practices, which require graves to be placed on ancestral land in individual grave plots.

The church and cemetery were closed during the Lutheran Reformation and the island was subsequently abandoned.  Folklore intended to support this abandonment appeared soon afterwards and generated a negative perception of the island as a place of death and danger.  Early 20th century accounts considered Haffjarðarey an unlikely location for an important community gathering place due to difficulty of access and apparent isolation, however recent research has demonstrated quite the opposite.

Archaeological excavations underneath the church floor uncovered human and faunal remains dating to the 17th and 18th centuries CE. Only indigenous individuals appear to be buried underneath the church floors. Despite significant forced labor practices (mita) at the time, few individuals buried in the church show signs of bodily stress or disease prevalent in those engaged in mining. Beyond the simple and sometimes problematic dichotomy of Spanish and indigenous, it seems likely that additional divisions appeared when considering the application and avoidance of the mita system of forced labor. In addition to bioarchaeological evidence, ethnohistorical documents show that some indigenous Andeans used the Spanish legal system, church service and labor agreements to evade forced labor at the mines. Further, analyses of strontium isotopes reveal that one-third of the individuals were not born locally, correlating with census records documenting rural migration into the city. Indigenous Andeans actively shaped their lives, using migration and manipulation of Spanish religious and legal systems to avoid the harshest occupations, thus moving beyond the stereotypical Black Legend trope.",Symposium,Presenter,Ellen_Lofaro,2.25,7,2.25,Sa-afternoon

Despite intensive study in the 1970’s and since, the inner structure and dynamics of Chimor have eluded archaeologists because there is limited information from European observers  and because there are many questions archaeologists have not yet addressed. At its maximum, Chimor extended  some 1200 km. from Carabayllo north of Lima to the Zarumilla River at the modern frontier with Ecuador. It had conquered and administered polities which spoke different languages: Quingam, the Muchic-speaking  heartland of Lambayeque and Jequetepeque, and  the valleys of the far north where Tallan and Sec were spoken. South of the Santa River, Quechua may have been a common language. In this region  the economic structure differed.   A study of new data and a reexamination of old evidence suggest that Chimor’s successes  arose from its social and political structure, much like those of its predecessors, the Moche and Lambayeque.  However, the seeds of its defeat by the Inka lay in these same institutions.

Among its characteristics are the emergence and adaptation of political and economic institutions, the emergence of religious ideologies materialized in iconographies, specialized production of material culture (ceramic, lithic, metallurgy), and architectonical evidences that show different levels of complexity. The contribution of different case studies is expected to focus on the elements that made possible the different hegemonic and domination processes in these complex societies seen as part of endogenous and autonomous processes in the South American region.

The physical removal of California Indians from their homes was also an attempt by Spanish missionaries and soldiers to re-imagine the indigenous world. Under Mexican rule, California Indians were transferred to ranchos to perform labor in similarly poor conditions. And during the early years of California statehood in the 1860s, so-called “vagrant” laws enabled white settlers to enslave California Indians who were found “idle” on their lands. Despite these hardships necessitating great change in traditional lifeways, California Indians remained immersed in and connected to a broader Indigenous world in which colonial places and institutions were only one part.

However, this does not always translate into engaging with indigenous and Native American studies theoretical perspectives in representing the results of research, even if the research itself was collaborative.

Western epistemological traditions and the institutionalization of these understandings of the world—the academy—have constructed ideological and physical dichotomies between nature and culture, pre-contact times and post-contact times, and tribal and colonial state boundaries. Archaeologists are in a unique position to engage multiple datasets and knowledges in partnership with tribal communities to challenge these deeply rooted settler claims to intellectual and physical spaces.

Theoretical perspectives from Native American studies can help decolonize archaeological narratives to show how indigenous peoples in contact with Europeans continue their entanglements with land, ancestors, traditions and values.

",Neolithic,Zooarchaeology,Mobility,"First developing around 8,000 years ago, pastoralism in Africa has continued as a flexible and dynamic mode of subsistence. One key feature of this dynamism is mobility, which is crucial for many East African pastoralists today to access seasonally available pasture and water. In areas of unpredictable rainfall, mobile pastoralism permits more people to live in dry lands than do other subsistence strategies. How the earliest herders in Tanzania used the landscape is still relatively unknown. Recent excavations at Luxmanda provide detailed information about early pastoral lifeways in Tanzania. Situated at the southern edge of Tanzania’s Mbulu Plateau, Luxmanda is the earliest and most southern known Pastoral Neolithic site, thus providing an intriguing example of pastoral mobility strategies as herding initially took hold in Tanzania. We present the first isotopic analyses of ancient livestock in Tanzania. Carbon and oxygen stable isotope data from sequentially sampled cattle and caprine teeth provide a record of seasonal herding practices. Strontium isotopes clarify movements across distinct geologies, providing a nuanced picture of both herding over the seasonal round and possible livestock exchange among pastoral groups. Finally, these analyses throw more light on the nature of the spread of pastoralism in Africa.

",Bronze Age,Archaeometry & Materials Analysis,Pastoralism,"Ancient animal management strategies have important implications for debates on modern pastoral landscape use in Eurasia. As livestock production intensifies in in semi-arid regions there is a need to identify the diverse set of strategies employed by pastoralists. Sequential carbon (d13C) and oxygen (d18O) isotope analysis of teeth from domesticated sheep at Bronze Age sites in Kazakhstan exhibit varied isotopic sequences. Sheep from Kent exhibit an inverse relationship where low d18O values coincide with high d13C values indicating that they ingested 13C-enriched graze during the winter season. This pattern is consistent with the foddering of caprines during the winter months when they are living in sheltered valleys near the site. In contrast, sheep from Turgen exhibit diverse isotopic sequences indicating variation in husbandry practices and landscape use. This is expected, as the  site is located in a mountainous landscape with access to high elevation summer pastures, forested areas, and the semi-arid steppe.

Stable isotope analysis of botanical, faunal, and human remains has increasingly emerged as a powerful tool for reconstructing local farming practices, including crop growing conditions, herding and foddering, and dietary reliance on different types of food.

Deposition of plants remains happens largely before the meal is served while animals are largely deposited after dinner. Our analyses reveal that conspicuous storage and communal dining formed the backbone of the political structure at Azoria.

While the commercial and political lives if these communities have been studied, less is known about aspects of day to day life such as diet and health. Here we present some insights based on paleopathology and collagen stable isotope analysis. 
This study (n = 275 individuals for Paphos; 94 individuals for Corinth) suggests populations that were under a certain amount of stress. Mean statures were relatively low, and rates of cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis suggest that periods of dietary deficiency were fairly common. 
Collagen stable isotope values were obtained for 34 humans and 17 comparative fauna from Corinth. Due to preservation issues, only six human values are available for Paphos. These are similar to those found for Corinth, suggesting a broadly similar diet at the two sites. Overall the human collagen values show a distinctive pattern of low d13C and high d15N compared to human values observed elsewhere in Greece. Carbon routing models and documentary evidence suggest that this pattern may reflect a largely grain- and oil-based diet whose modest protein component included marine products such as dried fish and garum.

Helmets of this kind were known to have been passed down through generations and even stolen and gifted. Homer describes one helmet being passed through seven hands before finally ending up on the head of Odysseus. All this raises the question of why warriors did not make their own helmets. What was it about the production and ownership of these helmets that was so special? Why did this type of helmet develop a romantic and timeless reputation in art and stories?

During the formative Archaic period (ca. 700-480 BC), Athenian history was marked by major political developments (e.g., early law codification, citizenship formalization), social stratification (e.g., classes), and conflict (e.g., tyrants). To date, such processes are known to us through texts, artistic representations, and elite-centered mortuary grounds. The collaborative Phaleron Bioarchaeological Project integrates a wide range of biological, mortuary, and historical data with scientific methodologies to elucidate the ancient lives of the commoners that remain unexplored or silenced. This project focuses upon the extensive necropolis excavated at the ancient Attic port of Phaleron (ca. 8th-4th centuries BC) by the Ephorate of Antiquities of Western Attica, Piraeus, and the Islands. The size, date, state-of-the-art excavation techniques, preservation, and mortuary variation of the cemetery including, among others, what appears to be non-elite strata, as well as mass graves and shackled individuals offer us with a previously undocumented view of the ancient Athenian past.

The cemetery appears to be associated with a previously undocumented hospital, probably connected with the nearby church of St. Luke the Evangelist. The skeletons were found in rectangular rock-cut graves, all of which contained multiple burials. Two non-standard graves held multiple burials that had been placed in the cutting all at once. We interpret these as mass graves, associated with a catastrophic event, possibly the Justinianic plague. Other graves were used repeatedly, often with much of the upper bodies above the hips being removed prior to subsequent burials. 100% of the graves have multiple individuals with significant bone pathologies. The differential diagnosis of lesions suggests that leprosy was found in approximately 50% of the skeletons, supporting our interpretation that the cemetery is associated with a hospital or hospice.

Here, we consider the macrobotanical assemblage recovered through flotation of more than 7000 L of sediment at the site of Iklaina, in Messenia, in conjunction with microbotanical remains (starches, phytoliths) to illuminate cultural and natural site formation processes that have either negatively or positively affected plant preservation and recovery. We have observed three tentative patterns: the relative absence of materials in both natural and anthopogenic drainage areas, compounded by the downhill erosion of deposits leading to “shallow sites”; heavy clay content which is destructive for both micro- and macro-remains;  and the importance of dumping episodes in relatively undisturbed areas that had fallen out of active use. This combination of patterns means that where evidence is preserved, it is rarely in primary contexts that can be used to discuss active-use spaces. Instead, it is better suited to discussions of disposal processes that reflect general and cumulative near-by activities and long-term patterns of resource use. Nonetheless, extensive horizontal excavation at Iklaina has revealed intra-site variation perhaps related to administrative zones vs. combined-use domestic/industrial areas.

The reference sample upon which it is based is a set of high-resolution 3D scans of fingerprint impressions left by modern Greek potters of both sexes; they were chosen on the basis that they are the closest population group, both genetically and occupationally, to their ancient predecessors.

A scan of a print provides a high-resolution representation, akin to a digital elevation map of the topography of the print, including ridge patterns, overall size, shape, and depression depth. We plan to use high dimensional multivariate statistical techniques to develop informative metrics that show high predictive power for the sex of the imprint maker.",3133,Symposium,Presenter,Julie_Hruby,4,15,4,Sa-afternoon,10,387,NA,Jane E.,Buikstra,Arizona State University,buikstra@asu.edu,(480) 965-6931,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Symposium,Discussant,Jane E._Buikstra,4,15,4,Sa-afternoon

Domestic activities associated with women are typically more apparent at sites of a more residential nature. Previous studies indicate that lithic assemblages associated with women’s activities are oriented towards use of processing tools and the production of expedient flake tools.

Recordation of exposed stratigraphic profiles is elucidating the multi-component stratigraphy and complex post-occupation submergence and salt marsh development.  Coring the marsh and GPR experiments focus on paleogeographic reconstruction of pre-submergence upland landscapes. Other research areas include radiocarbon dating of occupation horizons and timing of submergence, macrobotanical analyses to identify depositional environments, and foraminifera sampling to constrain paleo-tidal levels.

Use wear analyses were supplemented by protein, starch, and phytolith residue analyses of two specimens from curated collections. Although semi-lunar knives can no longer be considered “diagnostic” of the Laurentian Late Archaic, their broader association with northern fishing and maritime cultures remains.",Symposium,Presenter,Erin_Flynn,3.5,13,3.5,Sa-afternoon

Nevertheless, substantial data continues to be gathered from cultural resource management, academic, and state-level efforts using both traditional and non-traditional methods, that have expanded our understanding of Northeastern prehistory.

By implementing new intellectual frameworks like New Materialism and the consequent application of methodologies from archaeology and anthropology we gain insight in the actions of ancient bodies. 
Taking inspiration from Latour’s actants (2005), Barad’s agential realism (2007) and Bennett’s thing power (2010) – relating the potential of agency to materials and objects in human lives – the study discusses the physical relationship of material objects and the human body. With the additional help of experimental and experiential archaeology as well the focus on hitherto neglected objects we not only can bring the objects but also senses in the past to life.

",Bronze Age,Other,Ritual and Symbolism,"Shang (c. 1600 – 1046 BCE) elites were expert manipulators of soundscape. The intimacy of the relationship between music and authority during Bronze Age China has been well established, bronze bells having served as crucial markers of status and political prestige. Before the codification of the ritual orchestra, however, and beyond the performance of “music” per se, soundscapes were defined by factors such as climate and local ecological context, by animals, by the noise of human activity at large. As early as the Shang, soundscape was a defining component of the Chinese habitus, evidenced by the prevalence of birds imagery in ornamentation as well as the rich array of noisemakers. This paper argues that Shang elites – and particularly ritual experts –  wielded knowledge of local auditory contexts and utilized noisemakers such as rattles and jades in order to mediate between man, nature, and the ancestors. The resolution of natural cacophony through the orchestration of soundscape is an integral part of social evolution, or if one prefers, urban planning. Exploring Shang soundscapes is an opportunity to bridge scientific and humanistic approaches by combining analysis of the ecological record as well as man-made objects.",Symposium,Presenter,Kirie_Stromberg,1.5,5,1.5,Sa-afternoon

",Bronze Age,Iconography and Epigraphy,"Ideology, Ontology, and Memory","While archaeological analyses that focus on the experiential and sensorial past are becoming more common, scholars continue to discuss and dispute what knowledge of the past is accessible. Without moving beyond the material remains and into the realm of the self-reflexive researcher (Hamilakis 2013: 119), this paper will demonstrate that archaeologists do not need to stray too far from their traditional methods to uncover rich evidence of past sensory lives. By drawing from the field of art history and linguistics, the elaborate depictions of tomb scenes from Eighteenth dynasty Egypt might truly come to life as evidence for an ancient sensory framework. In addition, these tomb scenes were not designed for the dead, but also engaged with by the living. Though these scenes were augmented by their inclusion of deceased people and other such occurrences not commonly visible to the living, the activities depicted such as banqueting or hunting were those experienced by ancient Egyptians every day. How might the visible representations of invisible sensory experiences in these scenes be reconciled with the daily life of the ancient Egyptians? This paper seeks to understand this relationship with special emphasis on the visibility of the senses and the invisibility of experience.",Symposium,Presenter,Robyn_Price,1.5,5,1.5,Sa-afternoon

Histories of movement shape our perceptual apparatus and generate embodied knowledge. This recursive constitution of bodies, movements, and materials simultaneously defines the challenge and opportunity of phenomenological approaches within sensory archaeology. Explicitly or not, most researchers use their own bodily experiences of movement as analogies for making inferences about the material and sensory consequences of bodily movements in the past. As imitative learning produces shared embodied knowledge among craftspeople, likewise, archaeologists can engage with movements and materials to produce some degree of intersubjectivity with bodies in the past.

Only recently have such approaches become spotlighted in archaeological research. The theory and methods supporting these studies are wildly diverse and so there is difficulty in communicating across specializations. This session seeks to bring together scholars examining ancient sensory experiences that they might discuss with one another what it means to study sensory archaeology and what is accessible in the ancient sensory past. Areas of dispute thus far include: the centrality of the body to sensory research, the enumeration of the senses, phenomenological approaches, the importance of materiality, and the incorporation of interdisciplinary techniques like residue analysis, experimental archaeology, and even art historical and literary analyses.

From June through mid-August archaeological excavations were conducted at the Patipampa section of Huari, Ayacucho, Peru, where prehistoric constructions are not preserved on the surface.  The goal of this first season of excavation was to detect and expose outlines of the built environment in approximately a hectare of space believed to contain primarily residential remains.  As spatial organization becomes clear, individual architectural spaces are excavated to learn about everyday lie in the capital city of Huari.  This presentation provides an overview of project and its first-year results, while also contextualizing most of the other papers constituting the symposium.

During this period, a state society emerged in the Ayacucho Valley and expanded across Peru. Even before the emergence of this state, however, culture contact of the Ayacucho heartland had already started with some remote regions in the late part of the Early Intermediate Period (EIP). This far-reaching contact would have gradually been intensified toward the beginning of the MH. Indeed, such cultural influence can be seen in Ayacucho ceramics during this transition. One good example is an EIP Ayacucho ceramic style known as ""Cruz Pata."" It has been pointed out that this particular style bears the first indication of south coast influence of the Nasca culture. Despite being important, the Cruz Pata style has been poorly defined in the literature, and it has yet to be investigated more fully so that we can better understand the arrival of Nasca influence and its ensuing impact upon the emergence of the Huari state.

Entre las preguntas preliminares que genera este grupo de objetos está su función, la filiación estilística y la temporalidad dentro de las actuales cronologías propuestas y al interior del propio sitio arqueológico Huari. 

El trabajo se enfocará en el análisis de los rasgos estilísticos, para la cual se revisaran los estilos analizados y descritos por Menzel y los planteamientos de autores posteriores.  La observación de pastas servirá para diferenciar estas vasijas de otros objetos cerámicos asociados que los circundaban. El objetivo es establecer las relaciones estilísticas y culturales de este interesante hallazgo y lograr un aporte para este importante proyecto de investigación que ha generado inquietantes luces en su primera temporada de excavación.

In the 2017 excavations we used methods designed to expose the upper portions of walls, in order to define architectural spaces and clarify organization of the sector. Some architectural spaces were excavated more completely, fully exposing walls and architectural features.

Our excavations revealed distinct architectural styles defined by differences in scale, construction materials, and construction techniques. Analysis shows clear linkages and relationships between structures with distinct architectural styles that are maintained across time. Differences in construction materials and techniques are frequently understood to indicate distinctions in the use and purpose of buildings, and differences in who could use those buildings. Our findings at Huari challenge these assumptions, showing that finely constructed buildings and spaces with distinct architectural features were at times integrated with more quotidian architecture.

This paper will define the architectural styles at Patipampa, demonstrate how buildings with distinct architectural styles are related to one another, and explore what these findings can tell us about the everyday life of the early urban inhabitants of Huari.",Symposium,Presenter,Halona_Young-Wolfe,4,15,4,Sa-afternoon

Investigations at Huari have focused almost exclusively on monumental mortuary and ritual areas, leaving a gap in our understanding of quotidian life of the city. The Programa Arqueológico Prehistória Urbana de Huari challenges generalizations about the nature of urbanism in early cities by investigating daily life and residential areas at Huari. Papers in this symposium offer insights from the first field season, 2017.

But there were many other routes to slavery in different times and in other places: not least the many routes which brought millions of enslaved persons to ancient Rome and its provinces in the Classical era. Can archaeological work on forced migration, ethnicity and ethnogenesis in the early modern world really inform research centred on the Roman Republic and Empire? Yes it can, as this paper aims to show.

",Historic,Ethnohistory/History,Slavery,"“Freedom is what you do with what’s been done to you” is a phrase attributed to Jean-Paul Sartre. While the French philosopher was concerned with political freedom rather than freedom in the context of slavery, Sartre’s words offer lessons for analyzing a vast spectrum of how individuals experienced the conditions of slavery and freedom. This paper explores an ambitious project of freedom and future-making initiated by a group of Barbadians one generation after emancipation in the English Caribbean. In 1865 the Cora landed in Liberia in order for free Afro-Barbadians to assist in the “civilizing” process already underway in the nation. We offer some preliminary thoughts on the material signatures of slavery and freedom observed in Crozierville, the small town established by the Barbadians. The Barbadian settlement in Liberia came to exhibit some of the attributes of the colonial society of their homeland that had been dominated by slavery just 30 years earlier. While the “Love of Liberty” brought Barbadians to Liberian shores, semblances of slavery are still visible on the social and physical landscape, highlighting the fragility of freedom in addition to the complexities of freedom-making for Africans and people of African descent on both sides of the Atlantic.",Symposium,Presenter,Matthew_Reilly,2,7,2,Sa-afternoon

Whether or not enslaved peoples were deliberately bred systematically to produce children for sale by the master is a topic that has been generally neglected in modern scholarship. This practice demonstrates the inherent inhumanity of slavery and is an example of what the scholar Orlando Patterson describes as “the gendered nature of slavery”. Women and children were often the most exploited as a result of their sexuality, a practice that has continued today in the modern era. The Works Progress Administration’s Slave Narratives present multiple firsthand accounts of the prevalence of this abhorrent practice in the United States. There is reason to believe that there may have been a breeding plantation among the properties of the Lloyd family, the owners of Wye House Plantation.

",Other,Mortuary Analysis,Historical Archaeology,"A central imperative in Historical Archaeology is to produce original  information and insights that cannot be derived from historical records. Sophisticated analyses of slave burials that combine the physical elements of burial grounds, coffins, and grave goods, with the biology and chemical signatures of the human remains, can identify and source first-generation slaves, and help to infer the social bonds reflected in their burial.
Orlando Patterson has defined slavery as “social death” to reflect the nature and impact of forced translocation and cultural depletion. Unassailable as this might seem at first glance,  recent work in underclass burial grounds at the Cape and elsewhere, challenge this deathly pronouncement  by suggesting that slaves from a multiplicity of foreign homelands were incorporated into a vibrant community of free and unfree people and who nurtured them beyond their short life into the long comfort of death. This finding casts a new light on the historical records to reveal  the permeable nature of slave society in the wider colonial world.

A close examination of documentation across the subsequent two centuries opens a window onto the complexities and contradiction of mapping casta categories onto the valley’s social geography.

Ambiguous early terminology was tied to an imagined body of difference often focused on skin color, or colorism. Intimate relationships of blood mixing made it also fluid and opportunistic; the concept of caste retracted, stretched, and grew according to circumstance, eventually merging with the concept of race as it developed in the 18th and early 19th century.

A great deal of attention has been focused on the shifting functions of mounds during Terminal Woodland / Emergent Mississippian times, when platform mound-and-plaza complexes become commonplace, corn agriculture becomes the norm, and higher levels of institutionalized status differentiation develop. In this paper, I define this transition as a “temporal frontier” and interrogate the effects of the period’s marginal position on its archaeological interpretation. In particular, I draw attention to the distorting effect of archaeology’s backward gaze in examining the changes that take place at temporal frontiers and advocate for a more forward-looking approach to the interpretation of these pivotal moments. My primary case study focuses on the Late Woodland Coles Creek culture (AD 700 – 1200) of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the interpretation of early platform mounds. Finally, I briefly consider how the concept of temporal frontiers may be used to better comprehend the archaeology of other transitional periods in United States prehistory.

Located between the Andean highlands and the arid coastline, the Upper Moche Valley chaupiyunga no doubt would represent a geological and ecological frontier in the absence of human occupation. However, over two millennia of human activity are inscribed upon this landscape and make it an excellent case-study for understanding the construction of a frontier landscape over the longue durée. Is it inevitable that the region’s geological and ecological characteristics precluded its characterization as a demographic, cultural, and political frontier? At what points may the anthropogenic landscape depart from the natural in being identified as a “frontier”? What processes may affect such departures? These questions are addressed using GIS analyses of settlement patterns, landscape use, visibility, and movement applied to data collected during a full-coverage pedestrian survey of the Upper Moche Valley chaupiyunga by the author.

Research conducted at Minaspata, a multicomponent site located in the Lucre Basin, Cuzco, Peru, in the heartland of the Inca state, suggests that the emergence of Inca imperialism in the 14th-15th century CE was the result of a complex set of social relations, materialities, cultural practices, and ontologies that were “assembled” over the previous several centuries.

Reframing the origins of agriculture through a longue durée perspective,"Asia: Southwest Asia and Levant
",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers,"Searching for the origin points of major cultural revolutions and transitions has long been a driver of archaeological research, yet led to research focused on perceived boundaries, rather than continuity. Research into the origins of so-called modern human behavior, the origins of social complexity, the earliest domesticates, among others, all focus on defining moments of change that may be undetectable in the archaeological record. Perhaps some of the most enduring archaeological questions revolve around the ‘origins of agriculture’. In this paper, we explore changing historical conceptions of the ‘origins of agriculture’ in Southwest Asia in archaeological discourse and how, through the lens of the longue durée, we can trace aspects of material culture, human action, and complex human-landscape dynamics in deep time. Using examples from the Epipalaeolithic of eastern Jordan, we address current debates on Neolithization by exploring the implications of perspectives that focus on ‘becoming’ Neolithic and ‘being’ a hunter-gatherer. Through this perspective we discuss different scales of material culture analysis; from the ‘ethnographic’ lens identifying individual behaviors in the past, to the longue durée of material culture trends. This multi-scalar perspective gives new insight into how we construct cultural boundaries and understand change during the ‘origins of agriculture’.",Symposium,Presenter,Lisa_Maher,4,14,4,Sa-afternoon

A variety of new groups emerged during the Bronze Age in the Carpathian Basin —some had powerful rulers holding feasts and controlling the trade in commodities, and some were egalitarian peoples leaving little evidence for social differentiation outside of age and gender. This paper uses a comparative and multi-scalar perspective to study two different social trajectories in the Carpathian Basin during the second millennium BC: the Lower Körös Basin in Eastern Hungary, and the Danube and its tributaries in Central Hungary. We begin with coarse-grained chronological settlement data and consider the importance of foundational differences in population in both regions. We then look at the productive catchment and yearly agricultural needs of settlements, and weigh their likely importance in decision-making at the household level. Finally, we address how geographic location and compounding trade interests over successive generations potentially influenced the changing relationships between people and communities in the Körös and Central Danube regions in the second millenium BC.

This introduction posits that such accumulations and sedimentations are not mere metaphor, and that the material world is the ongoing expression of the force of history. Following key post-structuralist insights, we argue that the contents of these histories are not internal to the human mind, nor to abstract ideological structures, but are produced through embodied practices that mobilize material objects and leave material traces, whether those traces be ceramic sherds, architectural remains, or bureaucratic documents. As such, archaeology is poised to not only engage with critical theoretical discussions in the social sciences but also to impact to our understanding of the “long now” of the present.

However, caution must be exercised in the application of this method to avoid projecting data onto times and places that are no longer represented by contemporary practices. In this paper, the authors argue that ethnoarchaeology is most useful for projects that focus on the longue durée when used in conjunction with a combination of micro and macro archaeological methods. Specifically, the use of microartifacts and micromorphology in conjunction with analysis of excavated artifacts allow one to piece together site formation processes and material patterns that relate to specific activities. A case study utilizing Hawaiian house sites exemplifies this approach. The case study presented here analyzes data from 16th century house complexes, a time when daily practices were developing in ways not reflected in the (later) ethnohistories. However, this paper illustrates that utilizing complimentary micro and macro artifact analytical methods allows for a reconstruction of daily practices by comparing the data with the ethnohistorically-derived predictive models.

Archaeological discourse has largely shifted away from addressing long-term change and continuity, instead exploring human society in narrower slices of “ethnographic” time, with only superficial reference to larger time scales. This is partly a reaction to earlier examinations of large-scale or long-term change, which frequently produced deterministic explanations that reduced or ignored human agency, or was unable to explain how different time scales articulated with each other. 

Yet this “ethnographic” approach has its own problems, and risks reconstructing archaeological “subjects” in ways that reinforce the divide between mind and matter, interiority and exteriority, or subject and object. How can archaeologists reinstate the “deep-time” perspective as one of archaeology’s greatest contributions to broader human knowledge? How could we turn to back to the longue durée in a way that addresses why people turned away from it in the first place? What should be the actual subject of archaeological history? How do objects, landscapes, materials, and other non-human entities contribute to deep histories? And how might we make room for agency and politics (if we can) in understandings of long-term change?
