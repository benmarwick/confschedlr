woodville plantation, also known as the neville house, is an important archaeological resource just outside pittsburgh, pennsylvania. the mansion was constructed c. 1780 by the family of virginian general john neville—of the seven years war, revolutionary war, whiskey rebellion, and early state and local governments—and was occupied by their descendants until 1973. this unique record of ownership resulted in a relatively undisturbed site delivered into the hands of a private preservation organization. recent architectural renovation projects have unearthed an extensive collection of artifacts dating to the entire period of european occupation and an earlier monongahela indian hamlet. this report introduces the curated collection, which will be available for the first time for professional research. it also illustrates challenges in the analysis and preservation of diverse archaeological collections at privately owned institutions with limited space and financial resources, highlighting public engagement through archaeological education programs.
