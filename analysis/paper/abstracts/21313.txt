since 2009, the programa arqueológico chavín has unearthed a series of historic burials from the monumento arqueológico chavín de huántar. although the identity of the deceased remains a mystery, initial archaeological and ethnographic evidence suggests that the individuals may be casualties of the war of the pacific (1879-1883), perhaps even chilean soldiers who met an unusual and unfortunate fate at the hands of chavín’s residents. the current paper presents radiogenic strontium isotope (87sr/86sr) data from tooth enamel from 10 of these skeletons in order to evaluate the above hypothesis. results demonstrate that nearly all of the individuals exhibit 87sr/86sr values that fall within chavín’s bioavailable range, suggesting that they were either born locally or hailed from a region with a 87sr/86sr signature similar to that of chavín. one individual, however—an older man buried in what appears to have been the remains of a military uniform—exhibited a 87sr/86sr value clearly outside of chavín’s range, raising interesting questions about his identity during this politically-volatile phase in peru’s history.
