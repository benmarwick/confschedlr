following the abandonment of the middle savannah river valley at the end of the 14th century, communities on the neighboring georgia coast adopted a new settlement system. at the scale of the region, this appears as a dispersal of settlement and an increase in size of the largest population centers that had previously existed. this paper presents the results of the first systematic intra-community survey of a large site on the georgia coast. results show how residents of the site spatially reorganized their community following the arrival of savannah river immigrants and how this reflects changed socio-political organization.
