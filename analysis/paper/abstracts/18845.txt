the use of close-range photogrammetry (crp) for 3d documentation is becoming a standard practice for archaeological site documentation.  less explored, however, is the utility of crp to document forensic scenes, especially those involving skeletal remains. since digital camera documentation is already a standard practice at forensic scenes, additional data captured for crp can be included alongside standard site photography. the purpose of this research is to demonstrate the utility of incorporating crp into already established scene documentation protocols. to exhibit the process of outdoor scene documentation, three mock scenarios using faux human osteological material were created in a typical central florida pine flatwood environment: limited and large surface scatters, and a partial exhumation. each scene was documented with a digital camera, both hand-held and mounted, as well as with and without ground control points. overall, the 3d models constructed of the burial proved to be more conducive to crp due to the uniformity of the ground surface. the models constructed of the ground surface scatters proved more difficult to create due to the complex nature of the ground surface vegetation. additionally, an overview of best practices for field data collection, post-processing standards, and output capabilities will be further discussed.
