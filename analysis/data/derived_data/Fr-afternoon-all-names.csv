The LiDAR data also demonstrate how the ancient Maya terraformed their environments to manage the flow of water and engage in sustainable agriculture.

The similarities in the management techniques, names and ritual practices associated with some indigenous plants (Elaeis guineensis (oil palm), Cola acuminata (kolanuts), Dioscorea spp. (yams) and Raphia hookeri (wine palm), among several peoples in the coastal areas of Nigeria reflect significance of prehistoric social contact, networks and trade relations. The culture of exploiting ‚Äúfamine‚Äù and wild crops during drier periods is reminiscent of human adaptation in periods of scarcity. Despite the effects of recent climate change, as well as the rise in exotic plants, the survival of certain indigenous plants as well as their undiminished value in socio-religious practices reflects the resilience of such cultures, a phenomenon characteristic of the human species.",Symposium,Presenter,Emuobosa_Orijemie,3.5,12,3.5,Fr-afternoon

In particular, the paper considers how aggregated hilltop communities formed and functioned under new social and economic conditions. Recent archaeological research from Andahuaylas suggests that the majority of aggregated Chanka phase ridgetop sites were likely inhabited by neither specialized agriculturalists nor camelid pastoralists, but rather populations which identified as agro-pastoralists. The paper suggests that threats of attacks by neighboring populations and climate induced economic risk, may have tethered populations to smaller localized territories which encouraged more fluid socio-politico-cultural identities. The author argues that hilltop communities in Andahuaylas may have witnessed a shift to a more integrated and inclusive socio-ethnic identity rooted in an agro-pastoral subsistence economy.

In many regions of the Andes during late pre-Hispanic times, ayllu members retraced their common origin and kinship ties through the celebration of a mummified founding ancestor. Ayllus could either be small or large and often the smaller units were hierarchically integrated into the larger ones. As result, ayllus tended to be nested and multi-scalar social organizations where an individual could be linked to a hierarchy of ancestors. In this paper, we seek to determine whether the largely farming communities of the Rapay√°n region of the Upper Mara√±√≥n during the LIP (1000-1450 C.E.) displayed a social organization characteristic of the ayllu or not.

I draw on the archaeological record of the Titicaca Basin for a preliminary exploration of this question. The production regimes used by Titicaca Basin peoples changed markedly over time, shifting from intensified agriculture in the Middle Horizon to relatively risk-averse strategies of pastoralism and rain-fed terrace cultivation in the LIP. But notwithstanding many basic cultural similarities among LIP Titicaca Basin societies, there are significant contrasts across this large region in the opportunities the land affords for farming and herding and the relative importance of these activities in late pre-Columbian times.

In the Cajamarca region of northern Peru, the beginning of the Late Intermediate Period  (A.D. 1000 ‚Äì A.D. 1450) saw a demographic shift, with many settlements forming or relocating to higher elevation defensible and occasionally fortified positions indicating possible increases in competition and conflict between local groups. This shift in the location of some communities might also reflect increasing economic specialization between farming and herding communities, as has been seen in some other Andean zones at this time. Recent research at the communities of Callacpuma and Yanaorco in Cajamarca is beginning to shed light on possible organizational differences between higher and lower elevation communities. Variability in spatial patterning, foodways, and ceramic production and use points to diverging patterns of organization among local Cajamarca communities at this time.

In brief, the ayllu has long been used as shorthand for community in the Andes, yet the parameters of the term ‚Äì spatially, diachronically and culturally ‚Äì have often been disputed. Here, we address the scope and limitations of this term in regards to cultural development, as well as archaeological analysis in the highland regions of the central Andes.

In this session, we focus primarily, but not exclusively, on the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1000 ‚Äì 1450), examining what constitutes the community across the Andean highlands. In particular, we examine the role played by herders and farmers in the creation of community, and how the social and economic organization of these activities may have impacted the formation of such communities. The Late Intermediate Period is also seen as a period in which there was an increasing economic specialization by farmers and herders. This session includes contributions from the Central Andes ‚Äì were the term ayllu has been most employed ‚Äì as well as from other regions, including Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina.

Traditionally, space syntax is undertaken using access analysis graphs for individual buildings, and axial maps for towns, which allow researchers to comprehend the configuration of space formally represented as connected points and lines in a network. This paper presents a selection of illustrative case studies on how space syntax can work with remote sensing data, GIS databases and other analytical tools, and adapted to address specific research questions and historical cultural contexts in Africa. Street network analyses of West African historic towns and structural examinations of preserved stone buildings on various sites along the Swahili coast are used to show in what ways space syntax graphs can be adjusted to the current research agenda.

",Other,Remote Sensing/Geophysics,Landscape Archaeology,"During the summer of 2016, preliminary geophysical prospection survey using ground penetrating radar (GPR) was conducted at the Neo-Punic and Roman period site of Zita, Tunisia.  Since the time available for the fieldwork was limited to two weeks, the survey focused on examining specific areas of the site to document certain architectural features, and in several locations where industrial activities were known to have occurred based on previous limited excavations.  Additionally, a region identified as a ‚Äútophet‚Äù, a sacred burial precinct for infants, was examined during the survey.  Goals for the GPR survey were different in each area examined, and the results will aid in future excavations and paleoecological reconstructions.
Results from all survey areas will be briefly mentioned, but the paper will emphasize two main target areas.  Two industrial sectors were surveyed, where iron metallurgy was practiced, and total slag volumes are estimated to assess the ecological legacy of the industry.  A second area of emphasis was the ‚Äútophet‚Äù burial precinct, for which the GPR survey produced unexpectedly clear results that enable analysis of the mortuary landscape.  Implications of all the results will be briefly discussed, and directions for future GPR survey and excavation will be presented.

Humans have inhabited southern Ghanaian forest for millennia, and nearly everywhere there are traces of human activity in the deep past. This paper discusses my integration of satellite remote sensing with traditional archaeological field methods to study longue dur√©e continuity and transformation in both West African societies and the landscape itself. I am consolidating previous survey data and expanding upon them using several methods of archaeological survey and remote sensing with the broader goal of tracing cultural patterns in the landscape using GIS. Specifically, my work has been testing the informed hypothesis that many sacred groves, hilltops, and low rises in the coastal hinterlands and forests of Ghana were the settlement sites of agricultural communities in the first and early second millennium A.D. To do this I used a combination of satellite imagery analysis, topographic information, and archaeological survey to predictively model and test where these sites will be located based on this hypothesis. I will also discuss some of the similarities, differences, successes, and limitations I have encountered while using remotely sensed satellite imagery for archaeological survey, in direct reference to my previous work identifying archaeological sites through vegetation patterns in Sierra Leone.",Symposium,Presenter,Sean_Reid,3.25,12,3.25,Fr-afternoon

",Historic,Digital Archaeology: GIS,Landscape Archaeology,"In 2011, we began a collaborative project with Boreda Gamo communities of southern Ethiopia to understand the spatial and historical relationships between settlements and sacred areas. Community elders guided us along winding footpaths that ascended 9 mountain tops leading to settlements that were first occupied in the early 13th century and have now been abandoned for nearly 100 years. Surrounding these historic settlements are sacred groves with springs, caves, and boulders that give physical evidence in their Indigenous religion of the animation of the non-human world. Yet, the canopy of trees also harbored cemeteries, Orthodox Churches, and stacked stone walls, berms, and trenches that reveal a history of conflict. We use Geographic Information Systems software in conjunction with collected locational data, physiographic and land cover data, oral traditions, toponymical associations, historic maps, and other documents to build historic settlement and environmental models. Using spatial data in collaboration with community knowledge we can begin to understand the complex local histories related to the introduction of Christianity, conflict, and environmental change.

",Iron Age,Remote Sensing/Geophysics,Coastal and Island Archaeology¬†,"The Swahili of East Africa are regarded historically as a maritime culture, whose coastal sailing networks and prosperous Indian Ocean trade connections can be dated back to at least the 7th century CE. Archaeological investigations have demonstrated that maritime elements were deliberately embedded in the architecture of the famous second millennium Swahili stonetowns, but a focus on urban areas has sometimes been at the expense of areas of potential maritime infrastructure within settlements, or of the broader maritime cultural landscape. 
This paper presents the results of the authors recent PhD on the development of harbour areas and maritime activity in the coastal settlements of the Zanzibar Archipelago, using a GIS comparison of archaeological data drawn from previous investigations, remote sensing, and geophysical surveys. The research has demonstrated a pattern of harbour features and the preservation of a series of shoreline maritime activity areas through multiple phases of urbanisation, settlement decline, and redevelopment. The paper offers a hypothetical perspective on the development of a common spatial organisation within these settlements, as well as the growing maritimity of Swahili society, based around the activities and roles of communal maritime areas.",Symposium,Presenter,Tom_Fitton,3.25,12,3.25,Fr-afternoon

",Other,Digital Archaeology: GIS,Quantitative and Spatial Analysis,"Settlement pattern analysis has long remained a key means of examining the social, economic, and political relationships among archaeological sites and the way those relationships changed through time. Two common approaches involve: 1) analyzing the relative sizes of sites to evaluate possible site size hierarchies, and 2) analyzing the spatial distribution of sites across landscapes to evaluate possible clustering or dispersion. This paper applies more statistically rigorous methods that commonly employed, namely Ripley‚Äôs K Multi-Distance Spatial Cluster Analysis to evaluate possible spatial clustering/dispersion, and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) analysis to evaluate possible site size categories/hierarchies. These methods are performed on archaeological site data from two distinct areas of the northern Ethiopian highlands collected by the Eastern Tigray Archaeological Project (ETAP) and Southern Red Sea Archaeological Histories (SRSAH) Project. Results show strikingly similar patterns in the two areas, including an increase in the number of sites and decrease in average site size over time, site clustering only during the Pre-Aksumite period, and a lack of site size hierarchies that are predicted by traditional models of state-level settlement patterns.",Symposium,Presenter,Joseph_Mazzariello,3.25,12,3.25,Fr-afternoon

From local houses, to regional landscapes, to global entanglements, the spatial relations among people, places, and things at these multiple scales offer increasingly nuanced perspectives on cultural change and continuity both past and present. Meanwhile, a growing suite of spatial archaeometric techniques‚Äîincluding geographic information systems (GIS), satellite remote sensing, aerial and UAV imaging, laser scanning, and geophysical prospection‚Äîhave become ever more  valuable tools for documenting, interpreting, and preserving archaeological resources. The time thus seems ripe for a critical conversation among Africanist scholars about the ways in which we integrate geospatial analysis into our research. In this session we propose to explore the current interplay between spatial archaeometry and socio-spatial theory through case studies from historical and geographic contexts across Africa.

Failing to make functional his terraqueous prairie- schooner or to make his desiccated meat-bread palatable, he pursued methods of condensing and preserving milk in sealed containers at several locations in Connecticut.  Before his success, bacterial infested milk caused a dreaded, and sometimes lethal, illness.  His meticulous attention to cleanliness and adoption of a vacuum pan for condensing milk that the Shakers used for condensing juice was a recipe for success.  His preserving and canning process allowed protein-rich sanitary milk to reach those who could not reach for the cow.  His successes proved vital to the military and long-distance travelers alike.  The Borden‚Äôs Condensed Milk Factory Site in Torrington Connecticut was one of his earliest condensing factories, relying on the waters cascading down from Burr Mountain Pond to power the process - the same waters that eventually carried much of his factory building away.

Brown anticipated and hoped that his actions might spur a rebellion that would spread throughout the South bringing freedom to all enslaved persons.  To some people he was a murderous lunatic; to others he was a martyr for the abolitionist cause; and, to many he was a hero whose actions sparked the onset of the Civil War.  Brown was willing to commit such extreme acts, including the deaths of his two sons because of his belief that slavery should be abolished at all costs.  

Following his execution, John Brown‚Äôs birthplace in the hills of northwestern Connecticut became a pilgrimage destination for those who revered the man and the principles he championed.  Although the house itself was destroyed by fire in 1918, the site has remained a destination for sightseers and admirers and is now a Connecticut Archaeological Preserve.

Approximately 8,700 artifacts were recovered from the site, primarily lithic tools made from locally sourced materials such as quartzite. These tools indicate the specific activity of fishing and processing.  Diagnostic artifacts recovered from the site indicate that it was utilized by indigenous people over the course of thousands of years, from the Middle Archaic to the Early Woodland. 
Among the site‚Äôs notable features is the presence of the diagonal weir, which is particularly useful compared to the traditional V shaped weir. This pattern allows for trapping activities to take place at lower water levels along the shore, whereas the V pattern concentrates the actions on the deeper, center portions of the waterway.  
This presentation will explore not only how the LeBeau site differs from other fishing sites found throughout Southern New England, but also how its artifacts provide a unique window into the past and how Native American people utilized the Quinebaug River as part of their seasonal subsistence strategy. And why these unique features included it to be listed as a State Archaeological Preserve.

Thirty years a slave, he purchased his and his family‚Äôs freedom and became a prosperous mariner-merchant-farmer and benefactor to fellow blacks. At his death in 1805, he owned over 100 acres of farmland, three houses, outbuildings, a wharf, and numerous watercraft. Respected by white neighbors/associates to whom he was known as Venture Smith, he became a local folk hero. Historical documents speak of his integrity, courage and strength. Smith‚Äôs life story is critically important to the study of slavery in New England, to African-American history, and to American cultural heritage. He is the focus of ongoing research across several continents. The BBC produced a film on his life: A Slave‚Äôs Story (2007).

Although the program has the explicit goal of site preservation, in practice it has spurred many additional benefits. Foremost among these additional benefits has been the forging of partnerships with the State Historic Preservation Office and inspiring stewardship for the sites so designated. While not every nominated site makes it to preserve status, just going through the process for consideration has made the value of these benefits more apparent to all involved. Nominations for archaeological preserve status have originated from a variety of concerned preservation groups, individual landowners, municipalities, state agencies, or at the request of SHPO. Many of the individuals or groups that have sought designation have not been traditional partners with SHPO‚Äôs archaeology program.

Historical ecology offers a holistic landscape approach to a phenomenon that archaeologically has often been viewed through shifts in diet and butchering practices. This study examines the creation of range practices at Spanish colonial Mission Lost Santos Angeles de Guevavi, near what is today Nogales, Arizona. Using multiple lines of evidence, this paper proposes a set of indicators to identify semi-feral ranching in both the archaeological and historical record. Isotopic evidence shows that semi-desert grasslands were most affected by the introduction of cattle and sheep. Faunal and historical analyses suggest cattle ages were loosely monitored, and animals were culled at an older age than optimal for meat and grease extractive strategies. These findings indicate a low investment strategy, which may have helped indigenous groups maintain traditional agricultural and gathering practices, augmenting their resilience in the colonial period. Finally, this paper explores how semi-feral cattle ranching was sustainable under historical conditions, but has since become an ecologically and politically problematic practice in the modern American West and used to justify U.S. federal interventions without community consultation on reservations.",Symposium,Presenter,Nicole_Mathwich,2.25,8,2.25,Fr-afternoon

Furthermore, sites of deleterious resource extraction are loci at which inequalities (in shared risk, representation, and benefit) are starkly experienced. In the spirit of the historical ecology framework, we call for papers that deal with the long‚Äìterm roots and intersectional character of resource justice issues. We encourage contributors to share models for activism, advocacy, and improved collaboration demonstrated through social organizing, policy work, and knowledge production partnerships.  Finally, we welcome critical challenges for academic structures and traditions of thought. The ultimate goal is to generously share and absorb perspectives that will improve archaeologists' abilities in advocacy and activism across the academic divide.",Symposium,Chair (Primary),Megan_Hicks,2.25,8,2.25,Fr-afternoon

Through the use of 3D modeling of deposit-based archaeological data, digital conjectural reconstructions, animations, and even virtual reality applications have been utilized to both further the interpretation of the archaeological record and share this record with an interested public audience.

Ethnographic evidence indicates that prophets realize their visions, in part, by transforming relationships between people and material objects. They shun, embrace, or reorient technologies, artifacts, and architecture.  Not surprisingly, in cultures where spiritual forces already animate artifacts and architecture, such reorganizations can produce dramatic changes in material culture. Much of the revitalization and crisis cult literature has logically focused on the role that colonialism played in creating new religious movements. Prehistoric contexts, however, exhibit a broader range of underexplored contexts such as environmental stress, disease, and war. The ethnographic and historical records of the American Southwest suggest revitalization movements extend far into the past. We argue that widespread changes in material culture associated with significant inflection points in southwestern prehistory (circa A.D. 700s, 1000s, and 1300s) document the work of ancient prophets.

We reflect on the conception and implementation of field and curation protocols that enabled years of innovative research into ancient Pueblo lifeways, work that continues today. Though fieldwork in the region has ceased, researchers still benefit from exceptional field recording standards, sound conservation techniques, and an explicitly behavioral project methodology. HRP was particularly meticulous in its attention to nuanced variation in archaeological deposits. In homage to the latter, we outline a case study of depositional content at Homol‚Äôovi I, a late prehispanic Hopi village and the most intensively excavated site within the Homol‚Äôovi Settlement Cluster. Using HRP data, we examine the co-occurrence of marine shell and turquoise‚Äîtwo relatively rare and symbolically important material varieties. Despite their scarcity, however, both were commonly deposited together at Homol‚Äôovi I.

Yet when this becomes evident in our oldest cultural proxy, lithic artifacts, is hotly debated. Much of the variation in how archaeologists study this question is caused by differing assumptions related to the constraints on the performance, and thus the learning, of the flintknapping process. This paper explores the consequences of the physical constraints within lithic technology on its cultural transmission, using a spatially-explicit agent-based model. Building off of our previous work (PLoSOne 2016), we examine the incomplete social learning of the technological knowledge to produce curated lithic tool kits. We measure the number of learning events produced under the different constraints within flintknapping that reside at the heart of this debate. These constraints include where the learning occurred on the taskscape, the significance of the cognitive difference between strategic knowledge and tactical know-how, the degree of equifinality of products from different sequences, the generative entrenchment between products and sequences, and the size of the parameter space of lithic technology. Using the developmental utility of our model, we discuss ways to improve both experimental and artifactual studies designed to test for social learning during the Stone Age.",Symposium,Presenter,Gilbert_Tostevin,3,10,3,Fr-afternoon

Here we examine the extent to which the variation in Acheulean tools compares to the variation among bird nests of North American passerines.

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Cultural Transmission,"Social learning by modern humans led to the repetition and persistence of stone tool forms we see in the recent archaeological record. The emergence of similar patterning in early hominin assemblages is often assumed to track the beginnings of social learning. Less clear is what was being socially transmitted during this early period. One possibility is that hominins learned how to make objects according to a shared ‚Äòmental template‚Äô. A second possibility is that specific sequences were learned, which led to repeated forms. Here we describe recent experiments that explored the interplay of stone-flaking intentions and the mechanical outcomes of fracture. By removing complex ‚Äòintent‚Äô from the experimental design, we demonstrated that repetitions in forms and sequences can occur by removing flakes in simple series, without complex goal-directed intentions, and that some of these forms mimic aspects of objects often assumed to reflect more complex cognitive processes. The emergence of repetitive form is possible through the transmission of simple stoneworking sets, or combinations of gestures, without an a priori conception of a manufacturing process or final goal, suggesting that complex forms of social transmission may not have been necessary until relatively late in evolutionary history.",Symposium,Presenter,Mark_Moore,3,10,3,Fr-afternoon

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Cultural Transmission,"The ability to transmit cultural information with high-fidelity across generations is a defining trait of modern humans. It is unclear, however, how and when this adaptation emerged in the human lineage. The earliest forms of human technology‚Äîstone artifacts‚Äîrequired knappers to understand raw material mechanics, as well as geometry (volume reduction, angles), and physics. Thus, it is often assumed that the spread of lithic technologies involved some degree of information transmission. However, archaeologists lack systematic methods to study the transmission of information from lithic palimpsests. A growing interest in this topic has emphasized design theory (Carr 1995), breaking down lithic technology into a series of independent domains of lithic production (Tostevin 2012) (e.g. core orientation, platform preparation). The research presented here used controlled knapping experiments to understand the influence of varied social learning conditions on these technological domains. The ultimate goal is to define attributes that can be used as proxies for information transmission in Paleolithic assemblages. We simulated two social learning conditions: emulation (lower-fidelity) and imitation (higher-fidelity) as novice knappers were taught Levallois technology. Results suggest that attributes associated with core orientation are more strongly correlated with degree of information transfer than attributes of toolkit morphology.",Symposium,Presenter,Kathryn_Ranhorn,3,10,3,Fr-afternoon

Na√Øve subjects received ~100 hrs training over several months, accompanied by regular behavioral, psychometric, and MRI assessments. To quantify skill, knapping performance was observed after every 10 hrs training and rated using a systematic rubric. We fit a multivariate model of artifact metrics to these ratings to derive an objective ‚Äúquality‚Äù score and regressed quality scores on hours practice per subject to derive individual learning curves.

The influence of verbal teaching on stone knapping skill acquisition,Worldwide,Paleolithic,Experimental Archaeology,Material Culture and Technology,"Teaching is uniquely developed in humans and was likely critical to the emergence of cumulative culture. However, the importance of various forms of teaching, including the use of language, in transmitting Paleolithic skills like stone knapping is less understood. Here we examine the knapping behaviors of 17 subjects who learned to make Oldowan and Acheulian stone tools from watching video demonstrations either with verbal instruction or without sound. Despite intriguing differences in brain activity (measured with fNIRS) between these groups, the mode of social transmission has yet to reveal significant effects on handaxe morphology, suggesting that verbal teaching may not have been necessary for the social reproduction of early stone toolmaking skill. We coded video-recordings of subject performance using BORIS event-logging software and a knapping ethogram to test for possible behavioral differences between conditions that might explain observed differences in brain activity and indicate influences of teaching on early-stage skill acquisition that are difficult to detect from artifacts. These data allow us to test for differences in the frequency and sequential structure of knapping actions across conditions and individuals, potentially guiding further artifact analyses and providing a more detailed picture of the influence of verbal teaching on knapping skill acquisition.",Symposium,Presenter,Megan_Beney,3,10,3,Fr-afternoon

This session brings archaeologists with a focus on experimental flintknapping together with modelers and human behavioral ecologists. Our shared goal is to improve our understanding of social learning in human evolution through study of the Paleolithic archaeological record. Participants will tackle some of the following questions: How is social learning embedded in lithic reduction? How is variation in tool form affected by social learning and ecological factors? Which tell-tale signatures of social learning should one expect to see over space and through time in the archaeological record, with special consideration given to the time-averaged nature of many Paleolithic assemblages?

",Historic,Other,Historical Archaeology,"Studies of industrial production have taken a prominent position within social theory. Social implications of factories and productive landscapes in the Caribbean have often been obscured by the socio-cultural palimpsest of plantation environments. Material culture studies of Caribbean factories, both structures and machinery, can be vital descriptors regarding enslaved and emancipated labour narratives. The connection between industrialisation, machinery, slavery, and manumission underlies major themes of the plantation organism. The industrialisation of the factory complex generated a newly habituated space and altered perceptions of workspaces from one of slavery and semi-artisanal, cottage-manufacture to constant mechanised motion, noise and ‚Äòfree‚Äô-production. Using the term anthropomorphic-machinism to cover both the relationship of workers to technologies being manipulated, it is possible to characterise the effect of machinery on the organisms themselves (labourers). Despite their continued financial confinement, Abolition marked the ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô of the labourer from the yolk of oppressive production. The introduction of industrialised steam machinery replaced the corporeal labour of the enslaved. The relationships developed between the labourer and the workplace is depicted within their interaction with procedure, machinery, technology and, eventually, the product.

This research was facilitated by study of human remains mitigated from a Naval Hospital cemetery in response to modern development. The interred at the site were lower ranking naval personnel including enslaved individuals. Other work on lead exposure in the region focused on enslaved plantation laborers revealed high levels of the toxic metal in skeletal elements which was attributed to exposure in sugar processing. The work presented here focuses on enslaved African laborers in a military context. The patterns of lead exposure for this group are compared and contrasted with those of both the regular naval personnel and enslaved Africans in a plantation context. Similarities and differences seen in the lead burden of the bony remains between these three groups that were connected to the sugar industry in different capacities highlight into the variability in lived experiences of enslaved Africans in the colonial Caribbean.

",Paleolithic,Bone Tool Analysis,Quantitative and Spatial Analysis,"It has been argued that Aurignacian projectile points made of antler, bone, or ivory represent a proxy for the initial dispersal of Homo sapiens into Europe. Our research reassesses this claim by using geometric morphometric analysis to study 547 Aurignacian osseous implements recovered from 49 European sites. This approach allowed the identification of eight volumetric templates reproduced by Aurignacian artisans during the manufacture of split-based points. Two templates were identified for massive-based points, one of which includes a number of variants. Spatial and chronological distribution of these templates suggests the dominant hypothesis must be reconsidered. We argue that Aurignacian armatures signal the development of innovative socioeconomic strategies by groups already present on the continent and linked to one another. In this case, the osseous armatures would have conferred an adaptive technological solution to prehistoric groups engaged in increased mobility. The subsequent adoption of the innovation at a continental scale must be linked with the dispersal of the Campanian Ignimbrite tephra. Finally, the replacement of split-based points by massive-based points suggests that an important transformation occurred in the technological strategies (i.e., curation versus expediency) implemented by earlier and later Aurignacians even though they favoured a similar mobility pattern.",Symposium,Presenter,Luc_Doyon,4,15,4,Fr-afternoon

Originally, these traits were thought to be adaptations to an open environment. However, discoveries of older hominins, such as Ardipithecus that were possibly only occasionally bipedal and did not have enlarged teeth, have refocused the origins of early hominins within a much more closed, wooded setting. Even the later australopithecines are currently cast as inhabitants of mosaic environments encompassing some closed habitats. However, research in some localities that clearly sample closed habitats do not yield hominins. The four million-year-old Mursi Formation of southern Ethiopia is a good example: its fauna, and stable isotopes values from mammalian teeth and paleosol carbonates suggest a fairly closed woody cover, more so than in penecontemporaneous localities of the region. Yet, the Mursi Formation has no hominins while the other localities with dryer and more open habitats do, suggesting that early hominins could not occupy exclusively closed habitat and were reliant on resources found in more open settings.

Increasingly archaeological practice has shifted from proposing intuitive links between mobility and the archaeological record to developing testable hypotheses evaluated through systematic, controlled experimentation. Computational modeling is becoming an important tool applied to this effort, for testing intuitively proposed relationships and discovering unexpected, counterintuitive ones.

The shifting patterns of monument construction, situation and clustering at the regional scale are analyzed using GIS techniques, and interpretations draw on resilience theory to try to understand the specific constraints a less-mobile history has on post-sedentary societies.",Symposium,Presenter,Jennifer_Bracewell,4,15,4,Fr-afternoon

Despite the importance of this period, the rate, pathways, and environmental impacts of the late Pleistocene human dispersals are poorly understood. To quantify the effects of these dispersals on the environment, and to better understand demographic development over the period, I implemented a new, computationally efficient numerical representation of human population dynamics and dispersal and incorporated this into a dynamic global vegetation model. This coupled model of human and natural systems simulates the way in which climate and other properties of the physical environment affected suitability for hunter-gatherer populations, while at the same time allowing humans to modify their local environment, i.e., niche construction, through the controlled application of wildland fire. Our model simulations show that humans could substantially influenced their environment even during the Last Glacial Maximum, selectively using fire to promote more open and heterogeneous landscapes. This anthropogenic modification of the land surface facilitated further dispersal and increases in population, a positive feedback that ultimately accelerates the growth and spread of humans across the planet.",Symposium,Presenter,Jed_Kaplan,4,15,4,Fr-afternoon

Previous studies including spatial, lithic, and raw material data revealed distinct mobility signatures from the site‚Äôs two Protoaurignacian levels, A1 being warmer and associated with residential mobility when the earliest level A2, directly preceding Heinrich event 4, is colder and associated with logistical mobility showed by a more expedient approach to lithic technology. From this portrait, we suggest that those signatures should be reflected in the faunal data by revealing distinct subsistence, animal acquisition, and carcass processing strategies from both stratigraphic levels.

The Moche are well-known for their representations of warriors and warfare, as well as the sacrificial rituals associated with the taking of prisoners. However, this martial focus was not consistent across Moche time and space, and regional variations indicate the existence of a potential field of expression which was used differently in different areas and times. In this paper, I explore that potential field of expression, and the representations of gender that could exist outside of the strongly-gendered warriors and priests. I focus instead on the center of a Moche spectrum of gender that had women at one end and men on the other. Clothing could cover areas of the body associated with gender identity, and diagnostic elements such as hairstyle could be covered or simply not expressed. In addition, contextual elements such as ornaments and adornments, items held in the hand, or settings can give clues to social roles and status relative to the warriors and priests, and form a greater understanding of how the iconography deals with gender.",Symposium,Presenter,Sarahh_Scher,4,16,4,Fr-afternoon

",Bronze Age,Zooarchaeology,Ritual and Symbolism,"At the Srubnaya-culture settlement of Krasnosamarskoe in the Russian steppes, dated 1900‚Äì1700 BCE, a ritual
occurred in which the participants consumed sacrificed dogs, primarily, and a few wolves, violating normal food
practices found at other sites, during the winter. At least 64 winter-killed canids, 19% MNI/37% NISP, were
roasted, fileted, and apparently were eaten. More than 99% were dogs. Their heads were chopped into small
standardized segments with practiced blows of an axe on multiple occasions throughout the occupation.  The repeated violation of the canid eating taboo, unique to this site, combined with the metaphor of human transformation into male canids, suggests that the participants entered a liminal state typical of a rite of passage. Parallels from comparative Indo-European (IE) mythology provide the indigenous narrative that gave meaning to this ritual: we argue that it was an initiation into the widely attested IE institution of youthful male war-bands, symbolized by transformation into a dog or wolf.

On the basis of an ancient Irish dog genome and an assessment of the spatiotemporal appearance of dogs in the archaeological record, a recent paper suggested that dogs may have been domesticated independently in Eastern and Western Eurasia from distinct wolf populations. Following those independent origins, a mitochondrial assessment suggested that the Mesolithic dog population in Western Europe may have been replaced by a population from the East. To test this hypothesis, we are generating nuclear genomes of ~10 Mesolithic dogs sampled from sites in Europe and Western and Eastern Russia, and mitochondrial genomes from ~400 dogs spanning the last 15,000 years across Eurasia. The results of this analysis will reveal the phylogenetic affinities of dogs that were present across the Old World prior to the introduction of dogs associated with farming communities.

The Arctic was the gateway for at least 4 independent waves of migration of dogs into the Americas, beginning as early as ~17,500-13,000 years ago, making this region particularly important for investigating not only the cultural and technological functions of Arctic dogs, but also the impact of successive introductions in the past 1,000 years on the high-latitude adaptations of prehistoric Arctic human populations.
 This paper will focus on the integrated use of genetics, GMM and isotopes to reconstruct individual and population life-histories of prehistoric Arctic domestic dogs. This combination of interrelated analyses allows for a comprehensive investigation into genetic, morphological and dietary variability for the identification of domesticates from archaeological assemblages, and for examining the relationship between domesticates and wild canids in archaeological contexts. Our results demonstrate that this three-strand analytical investigation can shed new light on continuity and change in human-canid relationships during these periods of migration, providing valuable information about the relationship between humans and animals in prehistory, and the complex cultural and technological diffusions of successive human migrations across the Arctic.",Symposium,Presenter,Carly_Ameen,3.5,12,3.5,Fr-afternoon

Domestic but not livestock, they typically share human space and diet more than most herd animals. They are more likely to be considered persons, with souls ‚Äì a trait they share with wild animals. Here I examine the spiritual status of dogs in early Near Eastern herding societies, as livestock-keeping spread through the region and it became possible to situate dogs in relation to other domestic animals as well as wild ones. I rely primarily on data from √áatalh√∂y√ºk in central Anatolia, where I have extensive contextual information, supported by patterning from other PPNB/early Pottery Neolithic sites. Drawing on the contextual analysis of animal bones, burial practices, and animal representations, I argue that dogs were not regarded in the same way as wild animals, but that they held greater spiritual power than domestic sheep and goats. This power is evident through taboos: on human consumption of dogs, and on dogs entering occupied houses.

This practice raises the question of why this practice was so prevalent. Circumstances leading to this practice were variable, but its consistency suggests an underlying factor in common. Using one of the earliest known cases as a point of departure, Bonn-Oberkassel from Germany, we suggest that this underlying factor in common is that dogs and people were regarded similarly. Further, as part of developing that framework, we suggest that in certain cases, simultaneous human-dog interments may not so much have reflected one or more dogs being buried with people, but rather one or more people being buried with dogs.

It is unclear how far back the current modern morphology of dogs goes, or how different ancient dogs were from their modern descendants. Here we present the results of analyses examining the differences between archaeologically identified dogs with modern domestic dogs, modern wolves and Pleistocene wolves to see how these groups have morphologically diverged. To do this we will examine the morphologies of both the mandible and the first mandibular molar and compare the through-time shape change of archaeological dogs to the baseline of shape variation of each of the reference groups.

While the presence of bodies in what was once the First Baptist Church of Philadelphia burial ground should not surprise us, contemporary documents and written histories of the congregation state that all burials had been moved to the Mount Mariah Cemetery in the mid-nineteenth century. The abundance of human remains left on the original site raises questions for historians, archaeologists, and others concerned with the legacy of interments. 

To create a foundation from which historians and archaeologists alike might explore these questions, I combine methodologies of big data management and analysis with more traditional historical research. This involved the collection of burial records for over 2,000 individuals interred in the cemetery and burial records for over 5,000 interred in other cemeteries in Philadelphia. I compare patterns of mortality in the larger Philadelphia community and those listed in the parish burial records, with data gathered from individual remains at 218 Arch Street.

",Bronze Age,Other,Frontiers and Borderlands,"Archaeological schools of thought vary between countries, with the discipline growing along disparate theoretical trajectories dependent on the historical particulars of a nation‚Äôs academic traditions. Often distance between such diverging theoretical trajectories is mitigated by communication and collaboration across borders between scholars. However, the Cold War that divided Western and Soviet nations geographically, politically, and culturally also applied to archaeological research, as the flow of information and people across borders was stifled. Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the mostly normalized relations that developed afterwards, a scholarly Iron Curtain has remained, diminished but enduring. Though certainly not as rigid as decades past, such a divide is visible in the limited number of American scholars conducting research in modern Russian, and in the exclusion of Russian research from our narratives about the prehistoric and ancient past. This paper examines the legacy of the Cold War in American archaeology, specifically in relation to the marginalization of Russian archaeological phenomena in our popular narratives. Ultimately, the peripheralization of these phenomena and regions does not result from anything that existed in pre- or ancient history, but in the modern political and cultural context‚Äôs shaping of archaeological thought and practice.",Symposium,Presenter,Nicole_Rose,2.5,9,2.5,Fr-afternoon

",Bronze Age,Other,Materiality,"Archaeologists studying prehistoric Eurasian steppe pastoral lifeways often seek inclusion into comparative research of urbanism, craft production, and complexity. Even as these studies contribute valuable information, they also reify their place in the intellectual periphery of archaeological inquiry. This peripheralization is due to several factors. First, the Eurasian steppe is perhaps unwittingly conceptualized as a relatively timeless socio-geographical periphery to ‚Äústate-level‚Äù social entities located to the adjacent south - western Asia, south-central Asia, and east Asia. Second, this peripheralization is ultimately a spatially-derived frame of mind, one that essentializes and promotes geographic and cultural space over equally important considerations of time and materiality. In the following paper, I interrogate the spatio-centric mindsets that permeate current studies of Eurasian steppe pastoral social groups; a mindset that contributes to the further marginalization of pastoral-based case studies in anthropological archaeology. To break out of this exclusionary mindset, I explore the ways in which meaning was made in Bronze Age pastoral groups through a more inclusive inquiry drawing upon ethnographic and archaeological case studies to illustrate how pastoralists engaged with time and materials (as well as space) as they undergo periods of social change and continuity.",Symposium,Presenter,James_Johnson,2.5,9,2.5,Fr-afternoon

However, these perceptions continue to color interpretations of Appalachia‚Äôs deeper past, despite the region‚Äôs long tradition of rigorous archaeological research. Some scholars have suggested that pre-Columbian Appalachia has remained peripheral in archaeological discourse because it comprised the geographic edge of different cultural expressions (e.g., Mississippian, Morrow Mountain) or interaction spheres. In this paper, we argue that Appalachia‚Äôs recurring position as a cultural boundary renders it uniquely suited for studying pre-Columbian interaction and connectivity. Drawing on spatial and contextual data from the New River headwaters of northwestern North Carolina, we attempt to reframe the southern Appalachians as socially and symbolically central to Woodland period events and histories, and we propose new lines of archaeological research to further interrogate erroneous impressions of the region‚Äôs inaccessibility, isolation, and cultural inertia.",Symposium,Presenter,Alice_Wright,2.5,9,2.5,Fr-afternoon

When I do, I am often greeted with surprise, confusion, and a polite suggestion that I should be in Papua New Guinea or other places where German anthropologists engage with people who are perceived as different from contemporary Europeans. In Central Europe, archaeology is traditionally tied to history and the people of its past are often assumed to be just like ‚Äúus.‚Äù Interpretive frameworks to explain the Iron Age, have long been derived from European medieval history, such as the concept of the F√ºrstensitz (‚Äúprincely seat‚Äù) of the early Iron Age, or from the European Classics, such as the notion that ubiquitous late Iron Age rectilinear enclosures (Viereckschanzen) are functionally similar to Greek temples. While a new generation of German scholars embraces critical history and social theory, the idea that the later European past is a familiar place is persistent.

In modern archaeological practice, certain regions and areas of study have been treated as peripheral to more central phenomenon. A considerable amount of literature since the 1990s has problematized unidirectional and monodimensional models of interregional interaction, premised on migration, diffusion, world-systems, state expansion, empire building, and more. However, despite considerable critique and increasing engagement with multidirectional and multi-scalar models for such interactions, many regions and moments in time remain outside traditional archaeological focus. This session examines areas of archaeological research that have been pushed to the margins of the discipline. Crossing chronological and regional boundaries, the papers presented here offer a global perspective on the causes and effects of disciplinary peripheralization in theory and practice.

How is it that Tlaloc took on this attribute, and what did it mean in the context of the Mexica? No image of Tlaloc from Tula features the cruller: in all likelihood the cruller takes on its role in the mid-15th century, during the period of Mexica expansion. 

In this study, the iconography meaning of the twisted cord will be examined, its meaning in both Maya and Central Mexican contexts, and a possible motivation for transmission. The study will revisit the fundamental union of fire and water at the heart of Tenochtitlan, in the twinned temple of Tlaloc and Huizilopochtli.

While Huitzilopochtli was a being unique to the Mexica, the Xiuhcoatl is generally considered to derive from an earlier entity referred to as the Teotihuacan War Serpent. Although the influence of Teotihuacan symbolism on later cultures of Central Mexico is undeniable, the portrayal of solar deities with supernatural zoomorphic weapons is more readily apparent in art of the Late Classic Maya Lowlands. Classic Maya solar deities and rulers often wield lances in the form of skeletal centipedes with protruding tongues made of flint. This paper explores the relationship between supernatural centipedes and fire serpents and argues that Maya conceptions of solar weaponry contributed to the development of the bellicose sun gods of Late Postclassic Central Mexico.

Classic Maya stelae have been proposed as precursors for the Early Postclassic stelae at Tula and the relief pillars of Pyramid B at the site in previous scholarship. While suggested Maya connections for the Tula stelae are often overstated, and local central Mexican stela traditions as well as ideas from Oaxaca and Guerrero also probably contributed to the genesis of these monuments, the role of Maya contacts remains plausible. Here I explore possible Maya analogs, including stelae, for the famed atlantid columns of Pyramid B. While in style and construction these sculptures reflect the legacy of Teotihuacan, their use of elite or royal images as literal pillars has conceptual parallels in Classic Maya stelae equating kings with trees, pillars of the sky and the axis mundi. I also critically assess the possible connection, first proposed by Kubler, between the Tula atlantids and the Terminal Classic figure columns of the Puuk area. While these similarities may reflect a common Mesoamerican background rather than direct contact, recent dating of the Tula sculptural style to 650-850 CE at Tula Chico increases the probability of interaction.

In addition, archaeological evidence points to sustained artistic contact between Central Mexico and the Classic Maya kingdoms from as early as the Classic Period. While the geographic region of the Maya is famously known for its jade, cacao, rubber, copal, and tropical bird feathers, the peoples of these regions also actively participated in the borrowing and lending of artistic knowledge. This session will examine the legacy of Classic Maya art and culture within the wider cultural sphere of Mesoamerica, both in contemporary cultures and later peoples who inherited and innovated upon the complex visual artistic vocabulary established in these earlier periods.

",Other,Zooarchaeology,Cultural Transmission,"Human immigration and biological invasions are high-profile topics in modern politics but neither are modern phenomena. Migrations of people, animals and ideas were widespread in antiquity and these are frequently incorporated into expressions of cultural identity. However, the more recent the migrations, the more negative modern attitudes are towards them. In general, native is perceived as positive and 'natural', whereas the term 'alien' is attached negatively to cultural and environmental problems. This paper will explore these value-judgements through the example of Easter, the most important event in the Christian calendar.

The Easter festival and its associated animals - namely the brown hare, rabbit and chicken - are all 'alien' to most of the areas in where Easter is celebrated. This paper will focus on the integrated use of scientific approaches (genetics, GMM and isotopes) with evidence from traditional (zoo)archaeology, art history, and historical linguistics to investigate the human-mediated dispersal of the brown hare and rabbit in connection with the Easter cult. It will argue that the cultural and temporal context of these ‚Äòalien‚Äô introductions are key factors for both understanding the origins of Easter and challenging widespread negative attitudes towards cultural and biological 'aliens'.¬†

By incorporating these various lines of evidence we are able not only to correct previous errors in species identification, but also to produce a contextual framework that informs our understanding of both emerging and entirely new aspects of Late Archaic lifeways.

At Lamanai, Belize, the main problem consists of distinguishing between pre- and post-Spanish contact deposits buried at a depth of 10 to 60 cm. Evidence of interaction with the Spanish includes a few European objects and two Christian churches. However, identifying pre-contact deposits is more challenging. Maya archaeologists typically rely on ceramic typology to establish chronology, but the main pottery type in use at Lamanai before Spanish arrival continued to be widely used after contact. Diachronic changes in the distribution of other archaeological correlates for pre- and post-contact assemblages, including structure features and lithics, are subtle and do not effectively demarcate deposit type. Here, I use the taphonomic study of animal remains to assess the integrity of the stratigraphic levels identified during excavations and determine whether these levels represent pre- or post-contact accumulations. The methods employed include bone counts, species composition, skeletal part distribution, refits on dry and green bone, and vertical distribution of elements.

",Bronze Age,Zooarchaeology,Subsistence and Foodways,"Zooarchaeologists have often employed binary oppositions such as urban consumers and rural producers, and distinguish between centralized/regulated and decentralized/unregulated animal economies with direct/indirect food provisioning systems to elucidate pastoral economies of early complex societies. As zooarchaeologists, we are tasked with bridging more abstract and ideational anthropological variables with the archaeological hard evidence as well as with a narrower set of more explicit zooarchaeological measures; thus, moving from heavily fragmented animal bones to complex and abstract human behaviors. A large corpus of cuneiform tablets from the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000-1750 BC) urban center of Kanesh (the archaeological site of K√ºltepe, Kayseri, Turkey) provide direct and indirect evidence for various aspects of agropastoral economy and offer detailed information on food ways with specific reference to animals. Thus, we have a unique opportunity to question the applicability and meaningfulness of dichotomized approaches to organization of every state or society in the ancient Near East or elsewhere. Theoretically, I focus on centralization and bureaucratic control, asymmetrical access and inequalities, and production-distribution-consumption dynamics. Methodologically, I bring together as many independent lines of evidence as possible with special emphasis on combined use of zooarchaeological and historical data to develop comprehensive and fine-resolution pictures.

",Neolithic,Zooarchaeology,Taphonomy and Site Formation,"During the transition to agriculture in southwest Asia, patterns of settlement site use reflect a major shift in the use of space by the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period. Diverse types of sites were utilized by this time, including locales primarily for ritual activities. More studies of ritual site use are needed to clarify how space was organized and used during the Neolithic Transition. This paper presents evidence of animal selection and refuse management to investigate the intensity of site occupation and use of space at Kfar HaHoresh (10,600‚Äì8,700 cal. BP), the only Pre-Pottery Neolithic site in the southern Levant that served a primarily mortuary function. I employ zooarchaeological methods to assess the intensity of site occupation based on the degree of hunting pressure that humans placed on small game from the environment immediately surrounding the site. Taphonomic analysis of faunal refuse deposition is used to further illuminate the use of space, namely cleaning practices. These combined results reveal continuity in the organization of ritual space over time, despite a shift in occupation intensity and clarify the interrelationship of ritual and habitation site use as farming life-ways developed.",Symposium,Presenter,Jacqueline_Meier,4,15,4,Fr-afternoon

In this session, we place zooarchaeology at the center of our anthropological and archaeological milieu to examine how zooarchaeological techniques and approaches can be made relevant beyond the more immediate reconstructions of human-animal interactions. Some issues to consider include: combining and reconciling zooarchaeological approaches with prevalent methodologies in other subdisciplines to produce more holistic and compelling narratives of the past; deploying zooarchaeological analyses as independent tests of inferences made based on other lines of evidence like ceramics, lithics, metals, botanical remains, etc.; using our understanding of human-animal interactions and animal behavior and physiology as the basis of investigations into settlement patterns, site occupation intensities, and patterns of mobility and migration; and, using taphonomic histories of animal remains to assess greater site formation processes.",Symposium,Chair (Primary),Siavash_Samei,4,15,4,Fr-afternoon

In this way, food remains provide a nuanced perspective on a variety of archaeological issues. This paper focuses on Wari imperial expansion and how foodways enabled both Wari colonists and local peoples to negotiate the colonial experience during the Middle Horizon (AD 600-1000), Peru. Using paleoethnobotanical data, I present data from the Wari site of Cerro Ba√∫l and the Huaracane site of Yahuay Alta in the Moquegua Valley, Peru. I investigate not only how Wari incursion impacted Huaracane foodways, but also how local environmental and social conditions shaped Wari food practices. A consideration of food remains will not only distinguish what can be considered uniquely Wari or Huaracane cuisine, but also how foodways may have developed on either side of the colonial encounter. More specifically, this study begins to characterize: 1) the alcoholic beverage chicha de molle as a medium of Wari culture that could be consumed by local communities; and 2) how the selective adoption and internalization of Wari chicha de molle by Huaracane communities may have shaped the colonial encounter.

Jecosh offers an ideal case study to examine Wari presence in the region due to its strategic location along important trade routes.

Archaeological context provides evidence of ancient Maya aggregation of disparate objects in tombs, caches, or sculptural tableaux as well as evidence of repositioning or separating things. These changes are fundamental aspects of objects‚Äô life histories. Yet in the twentieth century, ancient monuments and object sets also have been divided -- and new sets created--whether by national museums or research institutions seeking to trade duplicates or by players in the art market hoping to increase return by splitting paired or assembled objects. Such divisions are problematic, for new assemblages often frame modern understandings of them, and evidence for original assemblage may be difficult or impossible to reconstruct. This paper thus explores the importance of considering objects not just on their own but also in relation to other pieces to which they were connected.

",Iron Age,Ceramic Analysis,Ritual and Symbolism,"Gift exchange is most often discussed as an economic transaction. Whether goods are exchanged for social, political or cultural capital, the model for examining the practice is based on a commodity framework. However, gift exchange is also a performance, often with proscribed behaviors based on the culture and the individuals participating in the exchange. This behavior clearly falls within the realm of ritual as much as that of trade or economics. In this paper I discuss gift exchange as a performed ritual both within and across cultural groups. Furthermore, while gift exchange is a behavior between individuals, it often has larger ramifications for the communities these individuals inhabit. For example, gift exchange between political leaders may influence the lives of everyone within their society. This link between social organization and gift exchange is an important aspect of its power as a ritual behavior. In particular, I will discuss how ancient Greek elites used gift exchange as an important unifying ritual in order to connect disparate communities in order to maintain cooperative relationships.",Symposium,Presenter,Ivy_Faulkner,2.5,8,2.5,Fr-afternoon

Although excavations have largely focused on the sites themselves, archaeologists have long acknowledged the importance of the larger ‚Äúsacred‚Äù landscape in which these major ceremonial sites are situated, postulating that their proximity, visually and physically, to other sites in the landscape would have had an important effect on the performance and experience of ritual and ceremony. As such, these landscapes are not ‚Äúmonolithic‚Äù entities of sacredness, but have unique developmental trajectories that may have played an important role in shaping and reflecting emerging ideas in the local community.

Imposing monuments such as D√∫n Ailinne, Navan Fort, and Rathcrogan have provided tantalizing glimpses into ritual and ceremonial performances of the Irish Iron Age (~500 BC-AD 500). Communal feasting has been suggested to be a key practice at these sites during the later periods of use. At feasts, social structure and identity are reinforced, wealth is redistributed, and political alliances are formed. In this way, feasts become a space for community concerns to be negotiated. The large hilltop complexes, however, are not the only ritual spaces in Iron Age Ireland. During the later prehistoric period, there is a proliferation of smaller ceremonial enclosures and barrow burials. Variation in ritual performance at these different sites provide insights into cultural concerns across different scales of society.

I explore how the Church leadership and the Polynesian LDS created and actively negotiated the landscape of Iosepa into a community and home according to often fluid social and religious ideals and practices. I argue that this case can lead to interesting questions on the archaeology of belief and ritual as well as how both can play into the archaeology of colonial entanglement and mission contexts. Focusing on an existing collection of materials from one LDS family‚Äôs household along with spatial organization and historical documentation from the broader community, I first consider the implications of ritual, belief, and practice between the individuals and the community and second, I show how this understudied context expands the discussion on belief and ritual in mission studies and recent historical archaeology.",Symposium,Presenter,Kaila_Akina,2.5,8,2.5,Fr-afternoon

Secluded from the bustling capital city, the island‚Äôs rich history extends beyond the memorial itself. It served as a site of American Indian occupation in the pre-contact era, hosted John Mason‚Äôs plantation beginning in the late eighteenth century, was the training ground for the 1st U.S. Colored Troops during the Civil War and then home to African American refugees fleeing the South, and finally used for various recreational purposes through the early twentieth century, all prior to becoming a presidential memorial. Tightly woven into this history is a distinctly maritime thread, as the island could only be accessed by water prior to 1807. Even afterwards, water-based transportation and recreation continued to take place within the island‚Äôs unique landscape. Remarkably, remnants of these maritime components are still preserved on the island today. From wharves to watercraft, this presentation summarizes the maritime history of the island and highlights two maritime archeological features.",Symposium,Presenter,Bradley_Krueger,2.75,9,2.75,Fr-afternoon

During this time, Hurricanes such as Isabel, Ivan, Katrina, Sandy and most recently Harvey and Irma have caused extensive damage to NPS archeological sites.  Although not subjected to direct impacts from these recent hurricanes, National Capital Region (NCR) parks have been heavily damaged by their collateral impacts, typically in the form of flooding along the Potomac Valley.  It is simply a matter of time before a major hurricane strikes right at the heart of the Nation‚Äôs Capital, threatening sensitive archeological resources.    

Over the past three years the National Capital Region, has been gathering data and developing an assessment of park cultural resource vulnerabilities due to climate related threats to our parks. This brief presentation will discuss those threats and highlight how some NCR parks are addressing those threats.

The UAC is a summer program where urban youth learn about the field of archeology and how it applies to local communities and parks. Participants research the archeological significance of local parks, conduct excavations, identify and process artifacts, and create a culminating project to present to the community. The purpose of the survey was to fulfill the requirements of Section 110 of the NHPA. Simultaneously, the program goal was to train UAC participants in the process of conducting a Phase I survey from beginning to end.  This paper will focus on the fieldwork findings, but also discuss the utility in teaching the archeological process in the context of a NPS site.

However, the valley floor had low-topographic relief, large marshes, and soils prone to erosion, leading to many grand efforts of dredging and land reclamation. Flooding led to further raising of the landscape in the early 20th century, and to the deeper burial of archaeological sites. Fortunately, the Anacostia River valley was well-mapped in the 19th and 20th centuries, and 3D approaches to landscape visualization have recently allowed archaeologists to model the historic valley in the last half of the nineteenth century. Models of fill thickness have been generated and tested through geoarchaeological borings and trenches.

However, due to the difficulties in numerically dating them, they are usually considered as coarse indicators of past behaviors. Here, we explore the use of lithic weathering to develop local relative chronologies, and to better incorporate these assemblages into archaeological research. We test whether the most weathered artifacts should be considered the oldest; an assumption that has informally served to compare assemblages. Through macroscopic analyses, we compared seven surficial mid-to-late Holocene lithic assemblages from different micro-environments of the Atacama Desert, northern Chile. By recording changes in polish, texture, shine and color, we established that weathering varied significantly between two main locations: interfluve and canyon sites. Lithics from interfluve sites showed a dark coating and were moderately to highly weathered, whereas canyon lithics were mildly weathered and uncoated. This means that even within the hyperarid core of the Atacama, lithics of roughly the same age, are differentially weathered. We conclude that wind is the main weathering agent, mostly affecting artifacts deposited on inactive terraces or interfluves, where they remain persistently at the surface. Consequently, we stress the importance of considering taphonomic, geomorphologic and archaeological factors together when trying to establish relative chronologies.

Surprisingly, controversies on the natural vs. anthropic character of several lithic assemblages or ‚Äòindustries‚Äô did not prompt the adoption of taphonomic approaches by lithic analysts on a regular basis. Here I argue that archaeologist‚Äôs lack of knowledge about the effects of taphonomic mechanisms -whether natural or cultural- on stone and other knappable materials is the main obstacle towards a more comprehensive analysis of lithic assemblages. Furthermore, I propose that the study of taphonomic patterns (or background noise) in non-archaeological contexts is a mandatory task that researchers need to undertake in every region to achieve a more thorough understanding of lithic assemblage formation processes and trends. From the perspective advocated here both naturalistic and experimental constituents of actualistic taphonomic research are key to identify the agents involved in the formation of any fossil record.

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Landscape Archaeology,"During the past two decades Paleolithic research in Serbia has rapidly expanded with numerous cave sites currently under excavation. However, this focus on caves in largely upland terrain may create a biased understanding of the Paleolithic record. Typically, open-air sites are integrated into research projects to correct for this bias. Unfortunately, Serbia has very few open-air sites, requiring us to use other sources of evidence as proxies for understanding the Paleolithic record in lowland areas. One underutilized source of data is Lithic Surface Scatters.  
This presentation describes the Paleolithic surface material gathered from Pleistocene river terraces in Serbia and how researchers are using it to understand the Paleolithic record in the country outside of cave contexts.

",Paleolithic,Digital Archaeology: GIS,Landscape Archaeology,"Lithic surface scatters comprise a large proportion of the archaeological record but their value for understanding human behavior is often doubted. Modern geomorphological processes often laterally displace and selectively bias surface assemblages of artifacts. The predictable effects of displacement on the condition, weathering and size distributions of lithic assemblages is better understood. While topography is known to play a role in this process, the degree to which topographic variables contribute to the taphonomy of surface assemblages is understudied. Understanding how topography influences the displacement and taphonomy of surface assemblages provides a potential avenue for assessing the extent to which surface assemblages reflect past human discard patterns. We use digital terrain analysis to investigate the influence of topography on the formation of surface lithic assemblages. The modern geomorphology and topography of the lithic landscapes from the Koobi Fora Formation (Kenya) are characterized by digital elevation models obtained from unmanned aerial systems.  Spatial analysis is used to assess the relationship between the modern landscape and taphonomic attributes of surface assemblages. A discussion of the efficacy of this approach for assessing the integrity of surface assemblages is presented.

",Paleolithic,Lithic Analysis,Mobility,"Large scale surface surveys represent singular insights into the landscape scale variation in behaviors. Detailed investigations of the spatial distribution of artifacts across large spatial extents allow archaeologists to investigate a landscape as a single site. Surface assemblages have the advantage of large sample sizes and large aerial extents. However, biases associated with the formation processes of surface assemblages often undermine our confidence in the behavioral inferences derived from these records. Here we investigate patterns of behavior recorded in several whole assemblage behavioral indicators for seven assemblages recovered from the Acheulean dunefield site of Elandsfontein (800 ka -1 Ma) from the Western Cape in South Africa. Large surface and excavated assemblages of stone artifacts from similar locations allow us to investigate the impact of deflation processes on behavioral inferences. We use agent based models to develop expectations about the spatial variation in behaviors across this ancient landscape. Results suggest that the processes that created deflated surface assemblages have varied impacts on whole assemblage behavioral indicators. Some of these proxies of behavior appear to provide faithful representations of patterns derived from excavated assemblages. We compare these behavioral inferences to contextual data collected from excavated contexts.

Lynne‚Äôs map made two things startlingly clear. First, decades of excavations were not all referenced to a common datum and few had left visible surface indications, making it difficult to relocate earlier excavations and avoid re-excavating disturbed contexts. Second, just 10% of the core residential area has been excavated and far less than 10% of the entire site has been studied. To gain large-scale spatial control over ancient and modern subsurface disturbances across the site, the authors undertook a comprehensive magnetic gradient survey of the entire palisaded portion of the site. Data were collected using a Foerster Ferex 4.032 4-probe fluxgate gradiometer array mounted on a handcart. Data collection and processing was conducted by Ohio Valley Archaeology, Inc. Results of the survey are leading to a more comprehensive understanding of site organization and refined knowledge of the locations of excavations and other modern ground disturbance activities. Future fieldwork will focus on ground-truthing geophysical anomalies and updating archaeological knowledge of the site for all stakeholders.

With such a time focused definition, there is no doubt that the meaning of sustainability changes over time and by culture. An examination of three of Lynne Goldstein‚Äôs field sites, Aztalan, Fort Ross, and Michigan State University, provides an opportunity to dissect our modern take on sustainability. At Aztalan, sustainability of Native American culture comes into question as there is evidence that social equality did not lead to sustainable conditions. At Fort Ross, environmental conditions created problematic challenges for a pioneer settlement. At Michigan State, economic and environmental changes caused rapid constructions of what it means to be sustainable. Each case highlights the significance of the three pillars of sustainability (environment, social equity, and economic development) in analyzing past and present cultures. When taken together, the three sites challenge today‚Äôs thinking about the meaning of sustainability and how it can be achieved.

Goldstein played a key role in developing for the project a transparent and objective biocultural approach to determining cultural affinity that overcame problems encountered by previous projects in assessing cultural affinity. The approach relied on the equal weighting and assessment of three lines of evidence: contextual (i.e., archaeological evidence for mortuary treatment and social identity), osteological (i.e., the physical characteristics of the skeleton), and historical evidence (i.e., research into how the cemetery was used and the cultural traditions and identities of the people buried there). For each individual, the three lines of evidence were carefully reviewed and compared and a likelihood statement based on the distribution of all three lines of evidence was made (highly likely, multiple affinities, or culturally indeterminate). This model approach led to the identification of cultural affinity for nearly fifty percent of the 1,202 individuals recovered from the Alameda-Stone cemetery and successfully met the requirements of the stakeholder groups that claimed remains from the cemetery and Pima County, the project sponsor.",Symposium,Presenter,Joseph_Hefner,3.75,14,3.75,Fr-afternoon

Non-indigenous archaeologists studying Indigenous history can contribute to the erasure of Indigenous peoples from the accounting of their own past by centering the scientific study of material culture as the best or only way of knowing the truth. So what happens when an Indigenous archaeologist encounters her own ancestors in the archaeological record? In this paper, I explore how archaeology and cultural heritage help me to face and heal the intergenerational trauma of my M√©tis family, both on a personal and community level. The history of the M√©tis  Nation in Canada has rarely been examined in the archaeological record and, for many decades, Canada attempted to erase M√©tis identity. In light of M√©tis resurgence, I argue for the important role archaeology can play in helping us reclaim our rights and recognition. In this context, archaeology can fill in the silences and erasures of history, bringing disconnected M√©tis people home to their heritage in tangible ways.",Symposium,Presenter,Kisha_Supernant,3,10,3,Fr-afternoon

As with all intentional communities, material culture (i.e., architecture, clothing, landscapes) serves as an active medium to both reflect and reinforce social ideals, and community members are keenly aware of the symbolic meanings represented. At their peak, the Benton Harbor colony sent out preachers to spread the word, bands to spread the music, and baseball teams to spread the game. These journeys are marked in various ways in the colony landscape and architecture. Additionally, social and collective memories serve to reinforce their beliefs. Individuals that are no longer living or events that happened long ago are commonly remembered‚Äîoften triggered by material objects, landscapes, plantings, or specific places at the colony. This serves to not only reinforce social and religious ideology in the present, but is also a theological promise for the future.

",Other,Other,Resilience and Sustainability,"The pluvial conditions during the African Humid Period of the Early-to-Mid Holocene profoundly influenced environments across northern and eastern Africa, expanding lakes, rivers, and grassland ecologies. Archaeologists have often explained human responses to these increasingly aquatic environment as in terms of an increasing reliance on fisher-hunter-gatherer economies. Similarly, once the AHP ended, humans abandoned these lifeways. These perspectives are overly deterministic; in this paper, we approach this problem by adapting a Resilience Theory framework to examine a (type site?) case-site on the Lothagam-Lokam site near Lake Turkana, Kenya.

",Other,Zooarchaeology,Environment and Climate¬†,"Environmental heterogeneity and climatic instability in the mid-Holocene (~8,000-3,000 BP) are linked to increased socioeconomic diversity in East Africa. Increasing aridity ca. 6,000-5,000 BP encouraged early herders to migrate south into the region, while local hunter-gatherers intensified their reliance on ecologically-rich environments. Kansyore hunter-gatherers of the Lake Victoria basin established specialized subsistence systems that incorporated heavy pottery-use and seasonal site occupation at this time, possibly in response to decreasing rainfall. A gap in the archaeological record, however, limits understandings of Kansyore strategies in relation to environmental reorganization. Evidence from western Kenya suggests Early (~8,000-6,000 BP) and Late phase occupations (~3,500-1,500 BP) associated with changes in the frequency of pottery production/use, ceramic style, and fishing strategies, yet no evidence exists for Kansyore activities between these periods. Recent excavations at Namundiri A in eastern Uganda reveal a long archaeological sequence without breaks in the stratigraphic or material record. Faunal and ceramic data shows clear patterns of subsistence change similar to those observed between the Early and Late Kansyore, suggesting that this Kansyore ‚Äúgap‚Äù is the result of incomplete radiometric data and a dearth of targeted research in the region, rather than a break in occupation during the mid-Holocene.",Symposium,Presenter,Mica_Jones,2.5,9,2.5,Fr-afternoon

In addition to Bayira, Mota Cave contains a diverse lithic assemblage, as well as the onset of pottery. The cave has revealed evidence for the beginning of food production in the region. Fauna and flora remains suggest that agropastoralism began over the last two millennia. The excavations suggest that Mota Cave was utilized for a variety of purposes from a mortuary site to a living site to a place to seek refuge in times of conflict.

A preliminary review of the early AHP archaeological record shows that despite a small data set and a limited number of chronometric ages, there appears to be few sites in the Nile Valley, while in eastern Africa there are substantially more.

The relationship of environmental change to human social and territorial organization adaptations are fairly well-documented in northern, eastern and southern Africa. However, the Holocene terrestrial record of environmental change in east-central Africa is poorly documented. Stable carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotope analyses of human bones and teeth from northern Malawi suggest that hunter-gatherers exploited humid closed woodlands during the AHP (low 13C, low 15N), drier more open habitats during the MHDP (higher 13C, very high 15N), and relatively closed, humid woodlands during the later Holocene (low 13C, low 15N). Iron Age peoples consumed substantial amounts C4 plants (high 13C, low 15N). Strontium isotope data for small subset of these skeletons are insufficient to reconstruct residential life histories. With a more detailed terrestrial environmental history, more human Sr isotope data and a strontium isoscape, it may be possible to test ecological models of hunter-gatherer social and territorial organization in changing Holocene environments in Malawi.

These shifts presented sequences of challenges to the diverse hunter-gatherers, farmers, and herders that coexisted across much of Africa. This session examines the ways in which societies across Africa responded to local environmental manifestations of larger Holocene climate changes, and the long-term legacies of both successful and unsuccessful responses.

",Other,Other,Resilience and Sustainability,"The pluvial conditions during the African Humid Period of the Early-to-Mid Holocene profoundly influenced environments across northern and eastern Africa, expanding lakes, rivers, and grassland ecologies. Archaeologists have often explained human responses to these increasingly aquatic environment as in terms of an increasing reliance on fisher-hunter-gatherer economies. Similarly, once the AHP ended, humans abandoned these lifeways. These perspectives are overly deterministic; in this paper, we approach this problem by adapting a Resilience Theory framework to examine a (type site?) case-site on the Lothagam-Lokam site near Lake Turkana, Kenya. New excavations at Lothagam-Lokam have uncovered a sequence of small-scale local environmental shifts with interstratified cultural horizons that spans the entire Holocene. We argue that peopleís decisions to intensify or re-organize their economic strategies shaped their options and cultural attitudes in responding to subsequent stresses when faced with small-scale environmental fluctuations around Turkana. The interconnected cultural and economic systems gradually assembled through multiple resilience cycles ultimately conditioned responses to more extreme events such as the 60 m drop in Turkanaís lake level at the end of the AHP. Our application of Resilience Theory at Lokam provides a potential path forward for more nuanced discussions of human-environment interactions during the AHP.",3055,Symposium,Presenter,Steven_Goldstein,2.5,9,2.5,Fr-afternoon,28,NA,Elisabeth,Hildebrand,Stony Brook University,Elisabeth.Hildebrand@stonybrook.edu,631-632-7163,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Symposium,Chair,Elisabeth_Hildebrand,2.5,9,2.5,Fr-afternoon

Typically less than 3 m above sea level, atolls have been considered harsh settings for long-term human habitation due to nutrient-poor soils, limited potable water, and vulnerability to seasonally high tides and storm surge. However, the relatively small land area of atolls is bounded by expansive reef platforms, which host a rich and diverse range of mollusc species, offering an easily accessible source of protein and other minerals not available in terrestrial foods. However, since molluscs are critical to the functioning of c oral reef ecosystems, human harvesting can have long term impacts to these environments. We analyse prehistoric Marshallese foraging patterns using the first high-resolution study of the archaeomalacological record of Ebon Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands, eastern Micronesia. Our results indicate that a generalised foraging strategy, low human populations and a productive marine environment allowed sustained yields of molluscs for two millennia.

However, these environments are also delicate ecosystems that are susceptible to damage or alteration from a myriad of external forces.

The influence of environmental and anthropogenic forces on island and coastal settings has long been a topic of interest in archaeology.  Shifts in environmental conditions, and intensive exploitation of nearshore habitats by humans can have a dramatic and damaging impact on ecosystems. Conversely, shifts in environmental conditions can lead to the proliferation of natural resources, and the repeated, long-term use of these habitats by groups can result in unique management systems which carefully maintains an ecosystem.  Finally, researchers must also consider the ecological limitations of the taxa in their assemblages, as these variables can also have a significant impact on the way an ecosystem adapts to external pressures.It is therefore clear that to properly understand the use and evolution of island and coastal settings, researchers must take a holistic approach which integrates all these variables into their interpretations.

Rock art images and panels were treated as static representations of symbolic frameworks while their materiality and active role in cultural production were overlooked. Rock art is the product of the dynamic interplay between people, tools and the rock surface. The properties of the rock panel have the capacity to shape rock art production as much as the skill and knowledge held by the engraver/painter and the social context in which these engagements take place. Furthermore, rock art panels may accrue complex biographies via multiple engagements.
I combine a relational-biographical approach with digital imaging technologies (e.g. RTI) to the study of rock art carvings as a way forward to address these questions. By focusing on the biographies of Iberian warrior stelae (how they were made, reworked, etc.), relevant details emerge: despite iconographic standardisation there is variability in the techniques and procedures deployed which are linked to the interplay between the stone, the skill of the carver and her/his knowledge of local rock art traditions; stelae can be reworked at later stages and reused in a variety of ways, opening up a debate about the temporality of rock art traditions.",Symposium,Presenter,Marta_Diaz-Guardamino,3.75,13,3.75,Fr-afternoon

These settlements were intimately associated with rundale farming, a system of cooperative or collective agriculture. This system was a sophisticated response to specific ecological conditions. Lands within infields, outfields, and commonage were allocated so that each household received a proportionate share of productive and non-productive land. Thus, each community was highly adapted to its unique environmental niche. These settlements were also highly complex social organisms. Children kept cattle away from the gardens, cut and planted potatoes, and gleaned fields where grains were harvested. Women provided for the children, carded and spun wool, and tended to the household. Men were responsible for the management of farm lands. Thus, activity within each clachan and rundale was shaped by gender and age. Although maligned as ‚Äòbackwards‚Äô and ‚Äòprimitive,‚Äô clachans were in fact well-orchestrated socio-economic systems that distributed the risk of agricultural production among its members.

Traditionally, researchers have modelled the origins of Moundville within a political-economic lens: the growing aspirations of elites, who are implied to be male, are supported and fueled by stores of and feasts of maize, which is treated primarily as a resource to achieve their ambitions. However, through a careful analysis of the early landscape of practice of the hominy foodway of the Black Warrior Valley, I suggest that during this early period, it was not the activities of men, but instead those of new and endemic women to the area that first sparked and then united the early Moundville landscape. This analysis further suggests that what has largely been interpreted as a homogenous cultural expression for all people regardless of gender within the area was instead more heavily driven by, and had a greater impact on, female gendered activities.

These institutions were motivated to both understand the prehistory of the Northeast, and to build large museum collections for comparative and public engagement purposes. The drive to acquire largely intact objects led to the excavation of many graves throughout New England and the Maritime Provinces, but the frequent discovery of graves in Eastern Massachusetts due to urban expansion led to their heavy representation within the literature.

Persistent places like bedrock lithic sources may shape human movement; however, patterning in the distribution of stone tools may provide more than just settlement and exchange information.

WMCC is a ubiquitous stone tool material found throughout the LSJR sub-region during the Maritime Woodland Period (ca. 3000-500 BP) and appears as a (presumably) traded material in assemblages outside of the LSJR. Thus, the location of the bedrock source may have facilitated social interaction between different ethnic groups.

A planned urban center, the city developed around a series of neighborhoods designated as colonial, merchant, and African laborer spaces. Amongst the most prominent settlers were the Aku (Liberated Africans) from Sierra Leone and French traders from Goree who were instrumental in the growth of the colonial economy. The Banjul Heritage Project seeks to highlight contributions of the different residents to Banjul to the unique character of its neighborhoods, through community engaged research. This was at odds with the former Jammeh government which sought to exploit the nation‚Äôs connection to the slave trade via Alex Haley‚Äôs Kunta Kinte while erasing most physical traces of the nation‚Äôs colonial past in the capital. Entire narratives have been created and imposed on the landscape around Kinte‚Äôs home village of Juffure, and remnants of British rule in the capital were systematically removed.

Two aspects of Classical archaeology‚Äôs disciplinary history are particularly important for understanding the relationship between Greek archaeology (as practiced by American archaeologists) and modern Greece: first, Greek archaeology‚Äôs early and close relationship with the ideology of Hellenism and, second, the ways in which archaeological work in Greece has intersected (or not) with ethnographic studies of Greek communities. I then explore some of the current institutional factors (many of them legacies of the discipline‚Äôs trajectory) that either inhibit or fail to actively encourage collaborative archaeological practice in Greece. For archaeological projects supported by U.S. academic institutions, these include the academic position of Greek archaeology within Classics departments and the dismissal of Modern Greek as a legitimate field of study for Classical archaeologists. Finally, I suggest potential future directions for engaged archaeologies of Greece that directly confront this disciplinary legacy. How can Classical archaeologists both avoid uncritically promoting narratives of Classical Greece as the ‚Äúbirthplace of Western civilization‚Äù and actively advocate for collaborative practices within an academic power structure that is often unsympathetic to these concerns?",Symposium,Presenter,Grace_Erny,2.75,10,2.75,Fr-afternoon

This is frequently understood to mean local communities and nearby residents, but projects can live or die according to the will of groups less often discussed as part of the target public: authority structures such as permitting agencies or even national governments. How do such organizations figure into the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù of public scholarship? What happens when research is pressured to produce the narratives that authority structures desire?

global efforts to redefine archaeological practice are underway to ensure
a more just and equitable practice, political historiographies of colonial
archaeology in high income postcolonies, such as the United Arab Emirates

colonial archaeology maintains itself under the guise of ‚Äòscience,‚Äô as

equitable and decolonized archaeological praxis. This will include
entering archaeology (as a discipline) into transdisciplinary dialog with
contemporary art and design. Engagement is not limited to a human to human
