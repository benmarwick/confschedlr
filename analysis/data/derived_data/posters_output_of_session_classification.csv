","Other","Ethnography/Ethnoarchaeology","Caves and Rockshelters","Caves are natural spaces, but like other natural settings, they can be perceived by people through highly variable cultural lenses. Caves are not generally used as utilitarian spaces, but are more often sacred spaces where rituals are performed. The material record of these subterranean features can provide insights for how past peoples connected to the symbolic landscapes of caves, thus affording opportunities to assess behaviors. Research on the ritual uses of caves is fairly new in the Philippines, but cross-cultural comparison holds much promise. For instance, much research has already been conducted in the ritual use of caves in Maya contexts of Mesoamerica, which can be used as a foundation for approaches in other countries. Using best practices from cross-cultural contexts, this poster provides a preliminary analysis of certain cave sites in the Philippines. The research is based on a combination of recent field surveys and secondary sources, and offers a framework for identifying cave sites as sacred landscapes in order to contribute to ongoing studies of indigenous rituals in the Philippines.",16,"Richard_Nicolas","Th-morning"

Here, however, I move away from the traditional chronological approach, in order to examine the iconographic data present in the form of representation itself, the so-called palimpsest. The way that meaning develops though the act of layering itself is a process by which the icons interact and modify one another.

Larger-bodied Lethrinidae, which are common in both periods, show a decline in relative abundance, while smaller-bodied Acanthuridae show a corresponding increase in abundance. Although this pattern might be viewed as evidence for resource depression, potentially linked to intensive fishing of Lethrinidae, bone measurements show no decrease in the size of Lethrinidae over time. A number of factors can account for the change in taxonomic abundance.

This poster focuses on the zooarchaeological analysis of materials from Wupatki National Monument housed at the Museum of Northern Arizona. By determining taxa present, minimum number of individuals, animal portions utilized, cultural modifications such as butchering, pot polish, and bone tool manufacture, and natural taphonomic signatures, we provide a thorough understanding of animal use through time at the site. We further examine the Garden-Hunting hypothesis and discuss the relative frequencies of Artiodactyls and Lagomorphs in the community’s diet. Our research highlights the importance of zooarchaeology to understanding animal presence at the site and provides discussion on subsistence strategies as it relates to animal resource use in an arid environment.

The “axe-god” pendants consist of two parts; the superior part with decoration of human or animals, and the inferior part presents undecorated axe. This unique shape of “axe-god” is also can be seen in gold, bone, and shell artifacts in Costa Rica. Hence, the inferior part of the axe pendants may have important symbolic meaning, and focusing on the axe part is of great significance.

The archaeological stones from these sites are also compared with experimental assemblages employing various actions (e.g., scraping, cutting, gouging, perforating) to work several types of materials ranging from hard and soft plants to animal hide and meat to fish and shellfish, among others.  The analyzed tools are contextualized within the specific activity areas where they were recovered within sites.

Questions remain of the local implications of diet during this period of instability, when invasions and population decline occurred. Thus, this research compares Roman and Langobard populations from late antiquity to the medieval period using stable isotope analysis on bone collagen, apatite, and tooth enamel for 78 human individuals and 10 faunal remains to investigate diet in the Veneto. The results indicate variations in diet within and between the populations. The late antiquity sites are more consistent with a C3 plant diet with some marine and terrestrial animal contributions, while the Langobard sites are varied. This study shows that in late antiquity people in the Veneto still relied on a traditional Roman diet of fish and C3 resources after the fall of the Western Roman Empire; however, the incoming Langobards show variation in their utilization of resources, with some consuming more of a C4 diet with millet. This preliminary research may indicate a change in resource allocation during the initial transition into Italy for the Langobards.",8,"Ashley_Maxwell","Th-morning"

The Terminal Formative included the emergence of an urban center at the site of Río Viejo, which may have extended political influence over surrounding communities. During this period, on the coast of Oaxaca, ceramic figurines were a ubiquitous medium for expression and identity in political/cultural exchanges. By comparing ceramic figurines from the site of Rio Viejo, a primary center, to Cerro de la Virgen, a secondary community, relations between these two communities can be better understood. Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses, including INAA, much can be postulated about the manufacture and use of the ceramic figurines. The figurines from both sites have proven to be diverse in their iconography as well as sharing many other aesthetic similarities. With Terminal Formative figurines here some iconographic trends that seem to exist as categories such as anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, which are expressed by a number of well-preserved artifacts.

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.  This study hopes to test each these dynamics through the nondestructive analysis of ceramics excavated from Machu Llacta using a Bruker Tracer Vi handheld pXRF unit.

One variable state regularly recorded is that of cortex. The presence/absence of cortex is often linked to reduction intensity with variable cortical frequencies linked to early or late stage reduction and potentially reflective of residential mobility. However, we lack reliable markers or values to support our interpretations. Recently, Harold Dibble (and others) have proposed a method for evaluating assemblage cortex by comparing observed and expected frequencies. These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility. This paper applies the method developed by Dibble and others to the lithic assemblage from the Beaucoup site (24PH188/189) in northern Montana, a Late Prehistoric site with spatially distinct kill, processing, and residential areas. The lithic raw materials found in the assemblage (particularly quartzites) occur on-site and, as a result raw material size, shape, and origins are known. Our preliminary examination of cortex patterns indicates spatial differences between the areas of the site which may reflect variations in residential mobility.

","Neolithic","Ceramic Analysis","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers","Archaeologists suggest that during the transitions between the Pleistocene and the Holocene, drastic changes occurred in the lifeways of humanity. They are termed the “Neolithization processes.” Changes include the advent of food production and sedentism, and the adoption of pottery and ground stones. However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes. Our results add new understanding to our previous results on the timings of technological, behavioral, and paleoenvironmental changes.

Here, we present the results of a comprehensive radiocarbon dating program that utilized different preparative chemistry methods on osseous material from the site, including a single-amino acid extraction protocol using preparative High Performance Liquid Chromatography (prep-HPLC) optimized at the University of Oxford. This comparative approach has allowed us to obtain robust chronometric data for a key site in First Americans research.",6,"Lorena_Becerra-Valdivia","Th-afternoon"

The Tlajinga district is located along the southern Street of the Dead and was a possible entrance for migrants and visitors to the densely populated urban center of Teotihuacan during the Classic Period. Ceramic evidence suggests this district was occupied during the height of the city from the Early Tlamimilolpa period (A.D. 170 – 250) until the collapse of the city in the Metepec period (A.D. 550 – 650). With over 30 14C dates with measurement errors below ±25 14C yr from both human bone and charcoal specimens, Tlajinga is now one of the most dated districts at Teotihuacan. Combining high precision dating with ceramic evidence and utilizing the Oxcal Bayesian framework, this project explores the rise and decline of Teotihuacan’s southern neighborhoods providing insights for apartment compound construction events and population dynamics during the apogee of the city’s occupation.

The Terminal Formative included the emergence of an urban center at the site of Río Viejo, which may have extended political influence over surrounding communities. During this period, on the coast of Oaxaca, ceramic figurines were a ubiquitous medium for expression and identity in political/cultural exchanges. By comparing ceramic figurines from the site of Rio Viejo, a primary center, to Cerro de la Virgen, a secondary community, relations between these two communities can be better understood. Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses, including INAA, much can be postulated about the manufacture and use of the ceramic figurines. The figurines from both sites have proven to be diverse in their iconography as well as sharing many other aesthetic similarities. With Terminal Formative figurines here some iconographic trends that seem to exist as categories such as anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, which are expressed by a number of well-preserved artifacts.

Seven archaeologist-cooks each prepared a distinct recipe, in the same ceramic (un-glazed) pot, once a week for a year, and periodically sampled the charred residues for stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. During the final weeks, the cooks swapped recipes to see if the final meal would “over-write” the previous year’s cooking events, or if the chemical signature of those earlier meals would be retained. Our isotopic data show a consistent relationship to each recipe’s ingredients.

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.

These preliminary data demonstrate that Antimony (Sb) and Tin (Sn) are very important elements for measuring differences in round balls. One goal is to elevate the diagnostic value of round ball ammunition so that we can determine where the lead came from, who was firing the bullets, and how did access to lead vary over time. The pXRF information shows promise in identifying additives or contaminants introduced and military association. If combined with element data from lead ore sources, baseline information can be developed for comparison among battlefield assemblages and incorporated into a global dataset with the purpose of better understanding the geographic distribution of military supplies and military strategy at macro global and regional levels.",4,"Daniel_Elliott","Th-afternoon"

Recently, Harold Dibble (and others) have proposed a method for evaluating assemblage cortex by comparing observed and expected frequencies. These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility. This paper applies the method developed by Dibble and others to the lithic assemblage from the Beaucoup site (24PH188/189) in northern Montana, a Late Prehistoric site with spatially distinct kill, processing, and residential areas. The lithic raw materials found in the assemblage (particularly quartzites) occur on-site and, as a result raw material size, shape, and origins are known.

","Neolithic","Ceramic Analysis","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers","Archaeologists suggest that during the transitions between the Pleistocene and the Holocene, drastic changes occurred in the lifeways of humanity. They are termed the “Neolithization processes.” Changes include the advent of food production and sedentism, and the adoption of pottery and ground stones. However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes. Our results add new understanding to our previous results on the timings of technological, behavioral, and paleoenvironmental changes.

Flores, which became a provincial capital during the late Postclassic, was able to resist Spanish rule until 1697 AD, making it the last Maya holdout.  Given this distinction, the island has been under much archaeological scrutiny and the subject of many publications.  However, there has yet to be a thorough, diachronic study of animal use at Flores, and how the site compares to other Maya lowland settlements.  Due to its proximity to freshwater, Flores was in an area of great floral and faunal resource abundance.  This study aims to not only taxonomically identify faunal remains recovered on Flores, but also searches for patterns possibly tied to shifts in the social, economic, and political landscapes, especially as it relates to the Classic Maya ""Collapse"" and the arrival of the Spanish.  By understanding the history of animal exploitation and past ecological conditions, part of the answer to why Flores outlasted its contemporaries in regards to resistance to the Spanish is teased out.

These faunal isotope values support local expectations for foodweb research and fall into distinct niches in the foodscape of the environment. Differences in diet between domesticated and wild animals (specifically llama and deer) were not identified, suggesting no provisioning from possible domestic crops (maize, C4) by humans.

Quantitative analyses will demonstrate whether there are measurable differences in the shellfish remains between contexts. We will establish whether shellfish were exploited from single versus multiple habitats and whether shellfish deposits represent single versus multiple harvesting episodes. This research will demonstrate the importance of shellfish to the diets of early settlers and explore the relationship between early colonists and the landscape of the Chesapeake Bay.",13,"Samantha_Upton","Sa-morning"

Furthermore, many scholars treat diversity in equally simplified terms. Traditionally, individuals are assigned to an ancestral population of “best fit,” despite claims that this practice is unreliable. Migration and diversity are complex, intertwined elements of the human experience and must be approached in tandem using multidisciplinary methods.   
This poster outlines the methods available to examine past migration and identifies ways to incorporate them with evidence of diversity.

Using representative skeletal samples from these populations, an osteological analysis is performed to determine the presence of non-specific infection markers in the form of periosteal reactions. Any signs of reaction are scored by level of severity and stage of healing, and results from the samples are compared. Combining these health indicators with other socioeconomic factors can be informative about the social status of individuals and allow both a correlation of infection rates among suspected elite versus non-elite individuals, as well as make a socioeconomic versus health status comparison between two villages within the region coexisting within the same period. Results may aid future inquiry into non-specific infection rates among the pre-classic Maya of the lowlands, and provide an overall picture of health within a framework of social conditions during this pivotal time-period in Maya development. Furthermore, if infection rates are similar between K’axob and Cuello, this information could be used to make inferences about other similar Maya groups during the pre-classic.",7,"Katherine_McElvaney","Sa-morning"

The individual of interest was excavated during the 2012 field season at Xultún, Guatemala in a patio situated in the southeast portion of the site. The burial contained the remains of two additional individuals and was located just outside the Grupo Taaj structure, a small mural room dating to the Late Classic period. Through the use of microscopic analyses, such as starch and isotopes, and multiple macroscopic analyses, we provide a thorough investigation of this individual’s life, as preserved in the archaeological record, in order to provide insight into the importance of the burial and the role of both women and book makers in Maya society. Furthermore, this study expands on the role of an individual in Maya society and how that is reflected in a mortuary context, more specifically in the Classic period site of Xultún.

Our research tests the hypothesis that individuals relied more heavily on a food-based trade networking system with other coastal rather than highland populations, using a portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer to measure strontium, barium, calcium, and other elements in twenty-six human bones from four tombs in the Chincha Valley as a case study. Although the use of a non-destructive pXRF has become a very beneficial tool for the analysis of archaeological materials, relatively little has been done on human bone to elucidate subsistence practices, mainly due to limitations of surface analysis on potentially degraded and/or contaminated material.

Within the deposit cores occur in low frequencies and when found are generally nearly exhausted. The presence of both a primary prismatic blade-core and a secondary but significant bifacial and unifacial projectile point industry are indicated by both the debitage and the finished and near finished artifacts discarded in the obsidian dumps.

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.  This study hopes to test each these dynamics through the nondestructive analysis of ceramics excavated from Machu Llacta using a Bruker Tracer Vi handheld pXRF unit.

Here, we compare archaeobotanical assemblages from two excavation units, one of which shows an undisturbed chronostratigraphic sequence of ceramics, and another in which ceramics from different phases are mixed. The bases for comparison are three separate volume-based density measures of archaeobotanical remains.

I investigate how the challenges of this volcanic mountain steppe such as microclimates, altitude, slope, and aspect may have influenced planting and grazing on this difficult, but fertile, terrain and contributed to the dependence on resilient cereal crops such as barley. To create these models, I combine regional digital elevation models (DEM), satellite imagery, with archaeobotanical datasets from the multi-period sites of Aparani Berd and Tsaghkahovit. I then use modern climate data and paleoclimate proxies to calculate growing degree days (gdd) for these cereal crops and predict optimal planting locations in relation to these sites.

The presence/absence of cortex is often linked to reduction intensity with variable cortical frequencies linked to early or late stage reduction and potentially reflective of residential mobility. However, we lack reliable markers or values to support our interpretations. Recently, Harold Dibble (and others) have proposed a method for evaluating assemblage cortex by comparing observed and expected frequencies. These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility. This paper applies the method developed by Dibble and others to the lithic assemblage from the Beaucoup site (24PH188/189) in northern Montana, a Late Prehistoric site with spatially distinct kill, processing, and residential areas. The lithic raw materials found in the assemblage (particularly quartzites) occur on-site and, as a result raw material size, shape, and origins are known. Our preliminary examination of cortex patterns indicates spatial differences between the areas of the site which may reflect variations in residential mobility.

However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes.

In Bioanthropology, migration is often perceived in oversimplified terms. Researchers seek to determine if an individual or group migrated, and when in their lifetime this occurred. Furthermore, many scholars treat diversity in equally simplified terms. Traditionally, individuals are assigned to an ancestral population of “best fit,” despite claims that this practice is unreliable. Migration and diversity are complex, intertwined elements of the human experience and must be approached in tandem using multidisciplinary methods.   
This poster outlines the methods available to examine past migration and identifies ways to incorporate them with evidence of diversity. Scientific approaches, i.e. biodistance and isotopic analyses, will be combined with cultural approaches, i.e. the study of material goods and funerary accounts of diversity, and literary approaches, which document native Roman and migrant opinions. These methods will be applied to case studies from imperial Rome, which was characterized by diverse communities as a result of frequent conquest and large-scale population movements.

","Bronze Age","Bioarchaeology/Skeletal Analysis","Pastoralism","Extensive bioarchaeological research has addressed questions about stress, pathology, and activity in agricultural and semi-agricultural populations throughout the archaeological record, yet comparable studies pertaining to nomadic pastoral and semi-pastoral groups are relatively rare. During the Bronze Age in the Eurasian Steppes, archaeological evidence suggests a transition of lifeways from semi-sedentary agricultural to nomadic pastoralist. Entheseal analyses in bioarchaeology introduce an exciting avenue to ask new questions about the physical effects these lifeways have on those who practice them. This study aims to investigate the extent of entheseal changes among Bronze and Early Iron Age populations in Mongolia as both sedentary and pastoral groups were contemporaneous. Entheses of the upper and lower limbs were scored for 54 individuals dating from the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. Scores between and within the two periods were compared and entheseal differences between sexes, age, body size, and site location were analyzed. The goal of this study is to answer if there are differences between the two periods and which factors influence the differences.",8,"Matthew_Fuka","Sa-afternoon"

Thus, this research compares Roman and Langobard populations from late antiquity to the medieval period using stable isotope analysis on bone collagen, apatite, and tooth enamel for 78 human individuals and 10 faunal remains to investigate diet in the Veneto. The results indicate variations in diet within and between the populations. The late antiquity sites are more consistent with a C3 plant diet with some marine and terrestrial animal contributions, while the Langobard sites are varied. This study shows that in late antiquity people in the Veneto still relied on a traditional Roman diet of fish and C3 resources after the fall of the Western Roman Empire; however, the incoming Langobards show variation in their utilization of resources, with some consuming more of a C4 diet with millet.

Complicating the construction of a chronology for the site is the difficulty in using conventional ceramic typologies at Pueblo IV and early Colonial Pueblo sites in southern New Mexico. While the Rio Grande Glaze Ware sequence has chronological utility for sites in northern New Mexico, the chronological associations of the ware are much less secure for sites in southern New Mexico.

Isotopic analysis of skeletal populations are combined with demographic and life history information from individual secondary interments to model patterns of diet and mobility.

The Terminal Formative included the emergence of an urban center at the site of Río Viejo, which may have extended political influence over surrounding communities. During this period, on the coast of Oaxaca, ceramic figurines were a ubiquitous medium for expression and identity in political/cultural exchanges. By comparing ceramic figurines from the site of Rio Viejo, a primary center, to Cerro de la Virgen, a secondary community, relations between these two communities can be better understood. Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses, including INAA, much can be postulated about the manufacture and use of the ceramic figurines. The figurines from both sites have proven to be diverse in their iconography as well as sharing many other aesthetic similarities. With Terminal Formative figurines here some iconographic trends that seem to exist as categories such as anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, which are expressed by a number of well-preserved artifacts.

Seven archaeologist-cooks each prepared a distinct recipe, in the same ceramic (un-glazed) pot, once a week for a year, and periodically sampled the charred residues for stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. During the final weeks, the cooks swapped recipes to see if the final meal would “over-write” the previous year’s cooking events, or if the chemical signature of those earlier meals would be retained. Our isotopic data show a consistent relationship to each recipe’s ingredients.

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.  This study hopes to test each these dynamics through the nondestructive analysis of ceramics excavated from Machu Llacta using a Bruker Tracer Vi handheld pXRF unit.

In this study, I gathered a sample of 37 sites throughout the Great Basin with identified EE and/or ECN points, then developed an index representing the proportion of EE to ECN points in each sampled site. I then created several sets of geographic distribution groups and used Analysis of Variance to look for significant differences in index numbers between tested groups.

One variable state regularly recorded is that of cortex. The presence/absence of cortex is often linked to reduction intensity with variable cortical frequencies linked to early or late stage reduction and potentially reflective of residential mobility. However, we lack reliable markers or values to support our interpretations. Recently, Harold Dibble (and others) have proposed a method for evaluating assemblage cortex by comparing observed and expected frequencies. These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility. This paper applies the method developed by Dibble and others to the lithic assemblage from the Beaucoup site (24PH188/189) in northern Montana, a Late Prehistoric site with spatially distinct kill, processing, and residential areas. The lithic raw materials found in the assemblage (particularly quartzites) occur on-site and, as a result raw material size, shape, and origins are known. Our preliminary examination of cortex patterns indicates spatial differences between the areas of the site which may reflect variations in residential mobility.

","Neolithic","Ceramic Analysis","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers","Archaeologists suggest that during the transitions between the Pleistocene and the Holocene, drastic changes occurred in the lifeways of humanity. They are termed the “Neolithization processes.” Changes include the advent of food production and sedentism, and the adoption of pottery and ground stones. However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes. Our results add new understanding to our previous results on the timings of technological, behavioral, and paleoenvironmental changes.

Given this distinction, the island has been under much archaeological scrutiny and the subject of many publications.  However, there has yet to be a thorough, diachronic study of animal use at Flores, and how the site compares to other Maya lowland settlements.

By determining taxa present, minimum number of individuals, animal portions utilized, cultural modifications such as butchering, pot polish, and bone tool manufacture, and natural taphonomic signatures, we provide a thorough understanding of animal use through time at the site. We further examine the Garden-Hunting hypothesis and discuss the relative frequencies of Artiodactyls and Lagomorphs in the community’s diet. Our research highlights the importance of zooarchaeology to understanding animal presence at the site and provides discussion on subsistence strategies as it relates to animal resource use in an arid environment.

The “axe-god” pendants consist of two parts; the superior part with decoration of human or animals, and the inferior part presents undecorated axe. This unique shape of “axe-god” is also can be seen in gold, bone, and shell artifacts in Costa Rica. Hence, the inferior part of the axe pendants may have important symbolic meaning, and focusing on the axe part is of great significance. Both the crafting procedures and the basic form from which the pendant is shaped are closely related to the pendants usage.

This study presents the results of a comparative multi-year analysis of high and low power micro-usewear and residue patterns on 14,000-10,000 cal BP unifacial stone tools from the late Pleistocene archaeological sites of Huaca Prieta on the north coast of Peru and the Monte Verde I and II sites in south-central Chile. The archaeological stones from these sites are also compared with experimental assemblages employing various actions (e.g., scraping, cutting, gouging, perforating) to work several types of materials ranging from hard and soft plants to animal hide and meat to fish and shellfish, among others.  The analyzed tools are contextualized within the specific activity areas where they were recovered within sites. The contribution of these results to the broader inter-assemblage interpretation of the sites is discussed.

Though archaeologists have long been aware of the dangers of applying current knowledge to past contexts, does this mean that there is no way to infer human activity involving these non-ideal flakes? Behavioral archaeology offers a method to explore this issue through analysis of the performance characteristics of flake termination types in common daily activities known from the archaeological record.

Thus, this research compares Roman and Langobard populations from late antiquity to the medieval period using stable isotope analysis on bone collagen, apatite, and tooth enamel for 78 human individuals and 10 faunal remains to investigate diet in the Veneto. The results indicate variations in diet within and between the populations. The late antiquity sites are more consistent with a C3 plant diet with some marine and terrestrial animal contributions, while the Langobard sites are varied. This study shows that in late antiquity people in the Veneto still relied on a traditional Roman diet of fish and C3 resources after the fall of the Western Roman Empire; however, the incoming Langobards show variation in their utilization of resources, with some consuming more of a C4 diet with millet. This preliminary research may indicate a change in resource allocation during the initial transition into Italy for the Langobards.",8,"Ashley_Maxwell","Fr-morning"

Does the chemical signature of the residue accurately reflect the meal(s) cooked in that pot? Seven archaeologist-cooks each prepared a distinct recipe, in the same ceramic (un-glazed) pot, once a week for a year, and periodically sampled the charred residues for stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. During the final weeks, the cooks swapped recipes to see if the final meal would “over-write” the previous year’s cooking events, or if the chemical signature of those earlier meals would be retained. Our isotopic data show a consistent relationship to each recipe’s ingredients. However, the isotopic data from the final residue collection indicate the charred material was not only from the last recipe cooked but retained material from earlier cooking events. Therefore, archaeologists are cautioned in interpreting charred pottery residues as they potentially reflect multiple meals.",5,"Sophia_Maline","Fr-morning"

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.  This study hopes to test each these dynamics through the nondestructive analysis of ceramics excavated from Machu Llacta using a Bruker Tracer Vi handheld pXRF unit.

The presence/absence of cortex is often linked to reduction intensity with variable cortical frequencies linked to early or late stage reduction and potentially reflective of residential mobility. However, we lack reliable markers or values to support our interpretations. Recently, Harold Dibble (and others) have proposed a method for evaluating assemblage cortex by comparing observed and expected frequencies. These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility. This paper applies the method developed by Dibble and others to the lithic assemblage from the Beaucoup site (24PH188/189) in northern Montana, a Late Prehistoric site with spatially distinct kill, processing, and residential areas. The lithic raw materials found in the assemblage (particularly quartzites) occur on-site and, as a result raw material size, shape, and origins are known. Our preliminary examination of cortex patterns indicates spatial differences between the areas of the site which may reflect variations in residential mobility.

They are termed the “Neolithization processes.” Changes include the advent of food production and sedentism, and the adoption of pottery and ground stones. However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes.

Coffin hardware and funerary artifacts were uniform and indicative of middle or lower-middle class socioeconomic status. These data suggest a more nuanced view of tuberculosis treatment during the late territorial period.",7,"William_Marquardt","Fr-afternoon"

These deposits contain production debitage from most phases of blade-core reduction but no nodules and relatively very little cortex, suggesting that obsidian came into Cotzumalguapa as prepared cores. Within the deposit cores occur in low frequencies and when found are generally nearly exhausted. The presence of both a primary prismatic blade-core and a secondary but significant bifacial and unifacial projectile point industry are indicated by both the debitage and the finished and near finished artifacts discarded in the obsidian dumps.

Prior to the Spanish invasion, ceramics in the Colca Valley were likely primarily produced by a handful of specialized communities which would have widely distributed their products. It is therefore expected that there would be a standardization of clay sources and production methods producing ceramics with similarly standardized chemical signatures. It has been hypothesized that during the Spanish conquest of Colca Valley the resulting political and social transformations disrupted these patterns of production and distribution, resulting in the use of more diverse and perhaps more local clay sources and production techniques. This disruption was therefore expected to result in ceramics with similarly less standardized chemical signatures. Finally, it is an outstanding question whether the traditional patterns of ceramic production and distribution were re-established following the imposition of colonial rule, or new patterns were developed.  This study hopes to test each these dynamics through the nondestructive analysis of ceramics excavated from Machu Llacta using a Bruker Tracer Vi handheld pXRF unit.

Recent archaeological excavations have been carried out at the site of Bayovar-01 (occupied from the 5th to 8th centuries AD). The new data provide insight into the activities and adaptations of the desert’s ancient inhabitants. The presence of two small structures, a large activity area containing a significant amount of fish remains, and traces of hearths, indicate that Bayovar-01 was an opportunistic settlement, benefitting from favorable environmental conditions: the presence of an ancient lagoon ; and served as a specialized site for fishing and the preparation of fish. 
The analysis of charcoal remains from three different features corresponding to large hearth remains sheds light on practices of firewood gathering and usage. Taxonomic and morphological analyses reveal strong preferences for certain taxa, possible gathering strategies combining dead wood collection and tree felling, the usage of several different tree parts, and consistent combustion conditions across the three features. Despite selection biases, taxa composition may offer yet another indication of the existence different environmental conditions in the desert.",2,"Nicolas_Bermeo","Fr-afternoon"

To create these models, I combine regional digital elevation models (DEM), satellite imagery, with archaeobotanical datasets from the multi-period sites of Aparani Berd and Tsaghkahovit. I then use modern climate data and paleoclimate proxies to calculate growing degree days (gdd) for these cereal crops and predict optimal planting locations in relation to these sites.

However, based on recent studies, the nature and variability of the subsistence economy, especially wild plant resource exploitation for both human and livestock are not well understand. As a sedentary pastoral communities, the relationship between increasing livestock productivity and decreasing risk associated with resource sustainability is a continuous process. It achieved only through control of land for grazing, regulating the composition and size of herds, and the establishment of seasonal herding strategies including foddering. This research undertakes a systematic archaeobotanical and phytogeographical study of subsistence patterns among late prehistoric pastoralist communities during the Middle Bronze Age of north central Eurasia.The multi-disciplinary approach that draws productively from ethnographic, anthropological and archaeological evidence, to examine relationships between ancient settlements, local site catchments, and the emergence of new forms of livestock herding that integrated with earlier traditions of hunting, gathering and fishing during the Middle Bronze Age in the Southeastern Urals region of Russia.

One variable state regularly recorded is that of cortex. The presence/absence of cortex is often linked to reduction intensity with variable cortical frequencies linked to early or late stage reduction and potentially reflective of residential mobility. However, we lack reliable markers or values to support our interpretations. Recently, Harold Dibble (and others) have proposed a method for evaluating assemblage cortex by comparing observed and expected frequencies. These values serve as a baseline for interpreting and understanding assemblage variability along the lines of forager mobility. This paper applies the method developed by Dibble and others to the lithic assemblage from the Beaucoup site (24PH188/189) in northern Montana, a Late Prehistoric site with spatially distinct kill, processing, and residential areas. The lithic raw materials found in the assemblage (particularly quartzites) occur on-site and, as a result raw material size, shape, and origins are known. Our preliminary examination of cortex patterns indicates spatial differences between the areas of the site which may reflect variations in residential mobility.

","Neolithic","Ceramic Analysis","Hunter-Gatherers/Foragers","Archaeologists suggest that during the transitions between the Pleistocene and the Holocene, drastic changes occurred in the lifeways of humanity. They are termed the “Neolithization processes.” Changes include the advent of food production and sedentism, and the adoption of pottery and ground stones. However, case studies around the world suggest that the timings, order, and nature of the occurrence vary. More case studies are required to better understand the “Neolithization.” In this study, we focus on the transitions from the Upper Paleolithic to Initial Jomon periods of southern Kyushu, Japan. The earliest signatures of sedentism are found there. Pottery was adopted at least by 14,000/13,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Our previous study suggested that the advent of ceramics is associated with sea level changes but the change in climate and biomes may correspond with the increase in the occupational intensity, the proportion of decorative vessels, and lithic type variability. In this study, we conducted (1) a systematic literature-based investigation of ceramics, stone tools, features, and paleoenvironment, (2) a visual analysis of pottery and stone tools, and (3) map-based research of landscapes.
