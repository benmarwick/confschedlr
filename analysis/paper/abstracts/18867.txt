archaeological investigations at four fremont sites in the sevier desert indicate settlement-subsistence strategies changed after ad 1000, shifting from short-term processing camps associated with logistical exploitation of resources to residential occupation and intensive processing of rabbits. these changes may have resulted from population growth and economic stress, which forced an expanding sedentary farming population into less desirable locations until final abandonment of the region around ad 1220. the findings presented in this paper are consistent with other research suggesting population growth and resource depression occurred during the late fremont period, and provides important insight to prehistoric adaptations in the sevier desert during this time.
