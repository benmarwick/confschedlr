this project was an assessment of the “pioneers in texas” structured historical program aimed at evaluating the effects of a living history program on the participating students in an effort to expand the use of living history pedagogy in standard curriculum. the program is conducted at the 1830s jones stock farm at the george ranch historical park (park) in richmond, texas. the activity consists of lecture and participatory activities in the pioneer life experienced by one family of austin’s old three hundred. the park was interested in expanding an existing teacher-fed assessment to include students and their experiences; including, how the students recognized the jones family as a real family, and not a historical construct. the park wanted to assess how the program was effective in conveying history from the perspective of the jones family and how this impacted the students. this assessment was completed collectively through a pre-project participation, observation, and group interviews.
