the lienzo of coixtlahuaca ii, also named seler ii, was brought by the german mesoamericanist eduard seler to berlin, germany in 1897. the 375 x 425 cm document, made on the first half of the xvi century in the city of coixtlahuaca located in the modern state of oaxaca, mexico, is made of eight cotton cloths sewn together to form an enormous lienzo. the history of coixtlahuaca's cacicazgo, its territory and lineages, is depicted alongside their mythical origins and migrations. the document portrays in a prehispanic pictographic language, the history intertwined with landscape, showing the perception and close relation of it to the city-state settlement and the cosmological interaction between them. this presentation proposes an interpretation of the modern geographical landscape and its ties and perception to the mythical landscape and history portrayed in the lienzo. by interpreting the modern geography, mythical places of origin and foundation like the chicomoztoc and the coatepec, could be found within it thus, the landscape would fulfill the cosmological aspects needed for a settlement. the cosmology, history  and landscape should be considered an integral feature of the settlement itself.
