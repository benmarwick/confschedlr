political economies, or the “material foundations” for the institutionalization of power and control are complex and variable, within and across resources, political systems and incorporated communities (earle 1994). during the middle horizon, peru (ad 600 – 1000) the wari empire expanded from its capital in the ayacucho highlands to cover a region of the andes spanning over 1000km within present-day peru. the empire embarked on large-scale infrastructural projects (roadways, agricultural terracing and irrigation works, political and administrative systems, etc.) and had a political economy built on a combination of strategies, including resource control and the specialized production and distribution of both utilitarian and special-purpose goods. the empire relied on the vertical ecology of the andes to capitalize on regional resources, and to draw those regions into the wari interaction sphere. this research seeks to understand the intersecting relationships between regions, resources and wari power as enacted through the production, distribution and consumption of obsidian and other resources within the wari capital and hinterland territories.
