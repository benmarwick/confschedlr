trans-himalayan archaeology was always neglected by the historians and archaeologist. but some recent excavations and my ph.d field work presented an interesting view of trans-himalayan culture. the burial culture of this region dated back to 600-200bce. i found here the remains of pyro-technological activities. steatite bead was first time found in trans-himalaya. they are in size from 2 to 4 mm in diameter, 1to3 mm in height, and hole width is about 1 mm. the beads were examined by using sem and xrd. xrd examines shown that the beads are prepared of enstatite, a mg-bearing pyroxene, and cristobalite, a high-temperature polymorph of quartz, formed when quartz is heated at 900–1470 °c. our primary results suggest that the beads were prepared by heating talc to a high heat. first a paste was made from milled talc, water and a binding material. the paste was then molded into elongated shape and heated at a high temperature. this firing process made the paste hardened and transformed the talc into enstatite and cristobalite. lastly the shape was cut into the form of beads. i would like to present this work and also few other metallurgical activities which were also take place here.
