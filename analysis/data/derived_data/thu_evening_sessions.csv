The presence of ash in ritual contexts is well documented, but it also appears to have played an important role in the closing of domestic structures. In this paper, I present cases of ritual closure of domestic structures and examine the role that ash played in these closures using data from pithouse sites in the Mimbres region of southwestern New Mexico. These data show that ash was an important component of the abandonment and closure of domestic structures throughout the Pithouse period. I explore the reasons for the use of ash in these contexts and the relationship between domestic and ritual closure during the Pithouse period.

The presentation, besides including a brief description of the artifacts, it is aimed at reconstructing the objects<U+0092> unknown contextual information through a comparison with similar objects held in American, Mexican and European museums, some of them proceeding from scientifically excavated caves. The comparative analysis, integrated by information deriving from Mixtec codices and early colonial Spanish historical sources, suggests that a group of caves in Puebla and Oaxaca contained similar sets of sacred bundles representing earthly beings known as <f1>uhu in Mixtec language. The bundles must have been used in ritual performances related with the reciprocal exchange of gifts between humans and extra human beings. The aim of the paper is thus to provide the artifacts in the NMAI collection with some of the contextual information that was lost when they were looted from the cave. In this way, the artifacts reacquire their status of powerful instantiations of earthly fertility, thus becoming much more meaningful both for Mesoamericanist scholars and contemporary indigenous communities.

The use of pXRF to verify the composition of decorative pigments illuminates temporal and spatial patterns associated with the exploitation, processing and exportation of cinnabar.

This was the first account of a cave with a pyramid built over it and Thompson suggested that the cave contained seven chambers, hinting at the possibility of a Chicomoztoc. J.

The Gran Aqu<ed>fero Maya project undertook a restudy of the pyramid, shaft, and cave.  The stone floor at the base of the shaft was found to be the top of a small platform that predated the construction of the pyramid.

One variable which can influence the organization of extraction and production is the abundance or scarcity of raw materials in a region.  This paper addresses the extraction and production of chert materials among the Late Classic Maya (A.D. 600-900) in the lowland Maya region, specifically western Belize, a chert-rich area, to address the relative economic involvement of varying individuals in those processes and how these activities linked people throughout the region.  Specifically, this paper compares the extraction mechanisms and reduction sequences from a chert quarry and production area, Callar Creek Quarry, and a nearby production area, Succotz Lithic Workshop, using detailed lithic attribute and aggregate analyses to examine regional trends in lithic production and the economic activities involved in these trends. This paper finds that householders living adjacent to chert source areas produced specialized lithic materials for exchange through a range of mechanisms, including reciprocal and market exchanges, thus creating regional connections.

Given such patterns, it is far from obvious what factors would explain the simultaneity of the transition from Archaic to Formative.
