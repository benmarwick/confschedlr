central to anthropology is the concept of participant observation, where a researcher engages in immersive learning through ethnographic fieldwork. this concept is also important for archaeologists as immersive learning provides an avenue for more robust interpretation and the development of better research questions. participant observation is not directly possible in the study of medieval archaeology, but replication studies of food culture can serve as one avenue toward immersive learning in archaeology. replication studies of medieval food, notably the use of medieval cookbooks and replicated medieval vessels, offer insights into medieval life and everyday practice. this paper will discuss the replication and use of both cooking vessels and tableware as part of the process of immersive learning.
