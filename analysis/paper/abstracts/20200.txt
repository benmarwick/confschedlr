recent excavations at shell mound (8lv42), a civic-ceremonial center on the northern gulf coast of florida, have revealed many pit features with vertebrate faunal remains.  one such feature, a large, silo-shaped pit yielded a proportionately large number of skeletal elements identified to several species of waterbirds, a trait unique among contemporaneous sites reported within the area. the archaeological record of pre-columbian cultures of the north american southeast demonstrates the ritual importance of birds in the form of effigy pipes, copper and mica cutouts, and mortuary vessels that extend well into and beyond the first millennium a.d. given the spatial and temporal relationship of shell mound with a large mortuary facility (palmetto mound), and the relationship of the faunal contents with recurring iconographic characters of this time period, the avian assemblage from feature 25 should be expected to represent practices outside of everyday subsistence. based upon the presence of juvenile white ibis elements, which offer a proxy for the timing of capture for this apparently ritually charged class of animal, this paper proposes the presence of waterbird elements recovered in this context represents ritualized deposition coinciding with events surrounding the summer solstice.
