digital tools, such as photogrammetry and virtual environments have been around for decades. however, it was not until the past decade that the academic community introduced such tools into their work and have taken such discipline seriously. for this reason, the practice, management, teaching and potential of digital archaeology has remained a lagging field. as a response, this paper will provide a guide for traditional archaeologists to assist in the transition to the digital medium. an introduction to the essential vocabulary, theories and must know phases are provided in the paper. in addition, methodologies for a successful digital documentation, preservation and curation are given.  since such discipline is at its infancy in the academic world, we will address the advantages and disadvantages of this new type of data acquisition and post-processing. a complete description of available tools that will advance research questions, interpretations and communication in archaeology is presented here as well. like any innovation, issues and concerns arise; common and noteworthy issues will be summarized.
