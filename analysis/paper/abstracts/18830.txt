from 2002 to the present we excavated five apishapa structures in the purgatoire canyon. this presentation will provide a brief synthesis of structural types and food ways of the sites inhabitants.  it appears that maize and a variety of wild plants made up a considerable portion of the apishapa diet.  analysis of the floral remains from these sites indicate the sites inhabitants relied heavily on available edible plants but also consumed exotics such as pecans.  this brief synthesis puts forth our initial analysis of macro and micro floral samples from excavations along the purgatoire river .
