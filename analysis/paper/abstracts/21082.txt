this work offers a brief discussion on the importance of spondylus princeps and spondylus calcifer in the ceremonial, and economic life of ancient copan. archaeological contexts at the site indicate that the uses of spondylus, either as non-worked valves, or finished artifacts was restricted to a small high-status sphere of copan society. additionally, contextual data indicate that the spondylus was used in a least three ritual activities: as offering in burials; caches; and canceling of building. these uses of spondylus shells appear to be constant from the early classic to the late classic period. the lack of information from the postclassic period, hinders conclusions regarding the commerce of spondylus shells during this time. the two species of spondylus analyzed in this work are found in the pacific coast, from california down to ecuador. defining the chronology of the spondylus, chain of production, and the frequency of acquisition offers an opportunity to add new data on economic, and political interaction between copan and others neighboring settlements in the maya and non-maya area.
