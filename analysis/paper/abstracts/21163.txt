in this paper we present the preliminary results of our field season this past summer in the cerro coyotepetl neighborhood of tepeticpac, a señorío of tlaxcallan. archaeological prospection methods and remote sensing included magnetometry, electrical resistivity and photogrammetry by drone. though our work is ongoing, and another geophysical survey season is planned, results were confirmed by excavations on one domestic terrace. these excavations revealed the remains of four rooms whose occupation spans the late pee-hispanic and early colonial periods. we reflect on the success and limitations of our methods in identifying the modification of the tepetate bedrock creating a habitable space, and in our ability to detect walls, hearths, and other domestic features.
