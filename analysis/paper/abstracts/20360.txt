a significant majority of the nation’s archaeological sites are located within western public lands, rendering the rural american west a dominant socio-political context that shaped the development of professional archaeological practice in the united states during the early- and mid-twentieth century. analysis of oral histories and archival records pertaining to archaeological practice in montana (1935-1990) reveals how national ideals concerning race and class shaped the construction of heritage preservation laws. these ideals were entangled with the growing divide between professional and amateur sciences, and the establishment of modern land resource agencies, all of which fomented an antagonistic relationship among northern plains tribes, dealers, amateur collectors, and eastern professionals. the resulting heritage legislation provided professional archaeologists and federal land managers with near-exclusive (legal) authority over archaeology on public lands, a fact that has created long-standing frustrations among tribal authorities and local amateurs, who believe their contributions were marginalized and de-legitimized. these tensions persist today in montana and other western states, and have contributed to the polarization of professional, public, and tribal interests—an ongoing conflict that undermines national goals of heritage preservation within the rural american west, while confusing the public about the value and relevance of archaeological research.
