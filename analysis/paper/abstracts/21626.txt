in the late seventies and early eighties robson bonnichsen identified and tested several fluted point occupation loci adjacent to chert deposits on norway bluff, piscataquis county, maine. since that time various research projects have demonstrated the importance of chert from this region to the lithic economy of fluted point groups in northeastern north america. despite these new insights little archaeological research has taken place in the munsungun lake region since bonnichsen’s original study. here we present the results of our fieldwork from the summers of 2016 and 2017 that revealed the presence of additional lithic quarries in this location, as well as several potential fluted point sites associated with these newly identified quarry outcrops.  these finds further demonstrate the importance chert from the munsungun lake formation to the lithic economy of prehistoric groups in the region.
