past populations that are associated with the oneota archaeological tradition appear to have practiced a variety of burial practices. this paper serves as a presentation of another case study that contributes to our knowledge base of oneota burial practices. contexts for human skeletal remains recovered from oneota sites range from scattered isolated elements to primary burials (both extended and flexed) oriented in various directions, both within constructed mounds and other non-mound features. this paper summarizes the human skeletal remains recovered through 2016-2017 archaeological excavations at the dixon site (13wd8), as well as remains that were exposed in past years by both controlled excavations and stream bank erosion.  the site is an extensive oneota village site that was initially exposed by re-routing of the little sioux river in 1913. recent archaeological investigations were necessary for the much needed stabilization of the river bank.
