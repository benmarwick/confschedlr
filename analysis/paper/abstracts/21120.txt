equid had a vital role in animal economy in southwest asia. whether, as a wild animal providing primary/secondary to prehistoric communities, or a domestic source of energy, which supported war affairs and trade during historic periods. reconstructing the dynamics of human and the four-equid species, which were present in the region, is quite complicated endeavor due to; the paucity of skeletal evidence in faunal assemblages; the difficulties in distinguishing morphological traits to separate between the closely related species and hybrids; the perplexing morphometric approaches to identify equid’s skeletal elements. therefore, integrating archaeological and textual evidences from the historic periods in the near east, provides an exceptional opportunity to assess the distribution of equids, and their role on an economic and cultural levels. this study aims to demonstrate the available evidence of equid exploitation strategies during the bronze age, using zooarchaeological analyses. while, enhancing our knowledge on how domestic and wild equid species were incorporated in the early urban entities, through the archaeological and textual representations of these animals. compiling different lines of evidence is expected to illustrate how complex societies maintained their provisioning networks and maximized the intake of animal products within the early- urban cities in southwest asia.
