this study combines faunal, macrobotanical, and starch grain residue analysis from a middle holocene site on the isthmus of santa cruz island, california. starch grains recovered from groundstone artifacts provide direct evidence for the processing of plant foods. although mortars and pestles are often used as a proxy for acorn processing, those tested for this study were not dominated by acorn starch, and indicate that groundstone was used to process a variety of local plant foods. the majority of taxa identified in the starch assemblages were not present in macrobotanical assemblages, highlighting preservation bias and the importance of using an integrated approach. indeed, this study demonstrates that the lack of macrobotanical remains at many early sites on the northern channel islands may not indicate that terrestrial resources were not available or important, but rather that they are not preserving in the macrobotanical record.
