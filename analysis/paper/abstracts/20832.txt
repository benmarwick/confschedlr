for the past eight years, the french team from the cerap (paris-sorbonne university and the school for advanced studies in the social sciences in paris) has carried out research at the mesoamerican site of 7 venado, which extends over 4 ha lying 400 m south of the south platform of monte albán. directed by christian duverger and aliénor letouzé, with the support of the inah, the project has been able to date the site, whose chronology spans 800 bc to ad 300, and has also studied its spatial organization. it is composed of 14 buildings (pyramids, tall long platforms, etc.), arranged around 3 patios and 6 plazas articulated with monumental stairways. the work carried out since 2009 has enabled us to study new contexts at monte albán, first by excavating earlier buildings hidden under plazas, and second, by uncovering a large number of offerings of several types (caches, burials…). we propose to analyze the symbolic settlement of the sistema 7 venado through the spatial distribution of its architecture in conjunction with the evidence of ritual practices that marked the various cultural stages of this major archaeological site in mesoamerica.
