background: the 3-year active ageing and heritage in adult learning project (2014-17, eu erasmus+ program) involved five open-air museums in sweden, denmark, norway, uk, and hungary. sessions were conducted in venues matching the era of clearest memories for participating older persons with dementia (pwd), e.g., 1940-ties apartment.  university researchers (sweden, uk, & denmark) evaluated the project. this presentation describes qualitative results.
the objective was to investigate if/how experiences of participating in reminiscence sessions held in open-air museum venues affected wellbeing in pwd. 
method: pwd (n 129) were interviewed individually or in groups. third-person perspectives were gathered from carers accompanying pwd (n 75), and session facilitators (n 24) using questionnaires that included space for free-text responses. interviews and free-text responses were analyzed with content analysis. 
results: both museum venue and object handling stimulated pwd reminiscence. 
evidence strongly indicates that pwd wellbeing (denoted e.g., by showing pleasure, humour, creative self-expression, interest, sustained attention, and a sense of connection with others) was generally promoted through participation in museum-based reminiscence sessions.
conclusion: museum-based reminiscence sessions were successful for enhancing pwd well-being at the time of the session. further research is needed to explore and compare long-range effects of sessions.
