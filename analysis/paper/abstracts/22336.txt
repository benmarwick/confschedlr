the tumulus fields – landscapes heavily modified by monumental burial mounds – of central anatolia provide an opening to investigate how the tumuli reflect and create places of collective memory, territorial identity, and the social order. this project takes the iron age tumuli of the kanak su basin in yozgat, turkey as a case study and uses a gis approach based on available evidence: their location from archaeological surveys, and a small number of excavated mounds. this paper investigates the relationship between the settlement pattern and the burial mounds along axes of proximity, visibility, and accessibility using spatial statistics, viewsheds, and least cost pathways.
