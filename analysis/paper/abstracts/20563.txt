the fortified city of gothenburg was established around 1620, constructed when the swedish trade intensified its involvement in the world sea commerce. parts of the fortification, a garrison cemetery and two old country estates have been archaeologically excavated as a result of large-scale development of infrastructure in the city. 
the excavation results give new perspectives on the garrison and its cemetery. osteological analysis contributes to the interpretation of everyday life among garrison soldiers and their families. indications of social change in the population were discovered. exotic commodities had become available and popular through world sea commerce; rapidly adopted by the gentry of the town. a widespread increase in consumption of colonial goods such as sugar, coffee and tobacco is evident.
during the 1800th century some of the old country estates developed large-scale specialised cultivation of a mono-cultural and industrial kind, for example growing tobacco. knowledge of new commodities, such as colonial products, brought status and provided households with the possibility to advance in social position.
