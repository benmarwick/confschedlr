the inter-governmental panel on climate change has warned that increasing global temperature will exacerbate conflict levels. however, there is reason to be cautious about this assessment. while several recent studies have shown correlations between increased temperatures and conflict on the time-scale of years to decades, correlations over such short-term timescales may be misleading. the effects of anthropogenic climate change will likely go on for centuries and we know that long-term effects can be substantially different from short-term ones. therefore, it is important that we investigate the century-scale effects of increasing temperature on conflict levels. with this in mind, we analyzed three long-term historical conflict records—one from the classic maya region, one from europe, and one from china, each spanning multiple centuries. using a recently developed time-series regression method, we compared each conflict record to several regional temperature reconstructions. we found clear evidence for a positive relationship in the classic maya case, but our results were more complicated for the other two cases. thus, while changes in temperature can sometimes lead to changes in conflict levels, they do not always do so. in some cases, the relationship between temperature and conflict is mediated by social, historical, and/or environmental factors.
